While this is relatively low given the size of the loan book, this took the market by surprise, and the share price moved down. But despite this loan loss provision, the pre-tax income came in at $60.5M, resulting in a net profit of just under $48M.

And this includes the impact of almost $33M in loan loss provisions vs. less than $12M recorded in FY 2024. And from the perspective of a preferred shareholder, I’m of course very satisfied seeing AGM needed just around 12% of its net income to cover the preferred dividends.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>In the previous article, I was quite happy to see AGM had less than $225M in loans past due and non-accruing loans on a total loan book of almost $15B. I also argued that due to the low LTV ratio, the bank should be able to avoid high haircuts if a loan sours, as a substantial portion of the loans are backed by collateral. This doesn’t mean there will be no charge-offs, but I am still expecting the potential haircuts to be relatively limited.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>And it goes without saying that the vast majority of the loan portfolio remains in good standing.

That does not imply that the beneficiaries of the AI infrastructure buildout are exclusively on Jensen Huang’s team. Of course not. Technology investors should be well aware that the market has rotated across to the other companies involved in the value chain. And this includes opportunities in the utilities, industrials, energy, infrastructure companies. They are now riding an incredible secular wave known mostly to technology and growth investors in the past, arguably. However, in the era of AI disruptive forces, the market is rewiring how it is thinking about the ultimate winners and losers from this AI race.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-17722578929684258_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1867\" data-height=\"1066\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-17722578929684258_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nvidia Q4 updates\" width=\"640\" height=\"365\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-17722578929684258_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-17722578929684258_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-17722578929684258_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-17722578929684258_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Nvidia Q4 updates <span>(Nvidia)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, I find it perplexing for the market to sell off markedly after NVDA’s earnings release. As a matter of fact, the stock is now surfing closer to the levels that we saw in early February. Profit-taking appears to be the predominant sentiment surrounding NVDA right now. However, a closer introspection of the price action across the semiconductor industry shows that broad weakness has also manifested in its semi peers. In other words, I do not think that investors should be unduly perturbed about the current negative sentiment afflicting NVDA right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After all, how often do you find a company that is worth almost $4.5 trillion in market cap still being able to put out such incredible growth in revenue over the past year? Mind you, we are talking about a growth rate of more than 70% in Q4. It is an astonishing re-acceleration of growth from the July quarter’s 56%, and the 63% that the company notched for the October quarter. Obviously, the almost $700 billion in capital expenditure outlay that big tech companies have outlined is now flooding into Nvidia’s P&amp;L and mounting contractual backlog.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Which is why I thought the guidance was out of this world. And I was also flabbergasted at what the market was looking for, as Nvidia delivered an outlook that amounted to a 78% growth in revenue for the first quarter. That's an almost 80% increase, mind you. And we are talking about a company that posted more than $130 billion in revenue for fiscal 2025. And in the process minted more than $60 billion in free cash flow, equivalent to a margin of almost 47%. We are talking about a very high quality, immensely profitable, and dominant company among all its semiconductor peers right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But as always, we must respect the market’s wisdom. That isn't to say that we should simply accept what the market is printing over the course of just one week. Because unless you're trading on a very short time frame on NVDA, which I actually believe is unnecessary, we need to consider a longer-term approach when assessing the entry points, the trend bias, and also the overall sentiment that has underpinned its narrative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because, obviously, the market is looking at the next architectural transition for Nvidia. We already know that the company will be ramping up Vera Rubin from this year, even though I expect the older generations, such as Hopper, and Grace Blackwell, to still be the dominant ones and help the company to scale up profitably and maintain its high gross margins, which have actually surged to the 75% mark.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia: Still Scaling Blackwell Rapidly</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If anything, I believe it shows just how important and pivotal it is to demonstrate scale at the highest level. And if there's one company that has delivered the millions of GPUs while also seeing <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874926-nvidia-corporation-nvda-q4-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">nine gigawatts of Blackwell infrastructure</a> deployed across its customers, no one comes close. Moreover, the company has already moved past the snafu that threatened to scupper its tight partnership with OpenAI, as I explained in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4864706-nvidia-the-openai-deal-wobble-wont-break-its-ai-empire\">my previous Nvidia update</a>. Recall that the $100 billion LOI was thought to be at risk, although both companies appear ready to move on while also finalizing <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558700-openai-confirms-110b-funding-round-with-50b-from-amazon-and-30b-from-nvidia-softbank\">another $30 billion deal in the process.</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, when I look at the pessimism that is currently dominating the narrative, it seems to me that the market appears to be concerned about whether Amazon Web Services (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) is primed to make gains into <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-new-deals-mean-amazon-microsoft-nvidia?rc=3e6wgn\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nvidia’s much vaunted market share</a> in AI chips. The rejuvenated Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) has already answered the clarion call from its investors to show its ability to compete at the highest level. We know that not only has the company regained its competitiveness in delivering the most cutting edge AI models, it is now also ready to take on Nvidia in selling chips to customers, and most importantly, the hyperscalers. It is important for us not to forget that the top five hyperscalers account for over 50% of Nvidia’s revenue base. Therefore, the market could be really concerned this time, as Google’s ambitions could see it cream off some share of Nvidia's market. And with Google now having finalized the multi-billion TPU chip deal with Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), the wheels are finally set in motion, as the market worries about who is next, that could also join Meta in expanding these agreements:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-strikes-multibillion-dollar-ai-chip-deal-meta-sharpening-nvidia-rivalry?rc=3e6wgn\" rel=\"nofollow\">News of the Google-Meta deal</a> comes days after Nvidia announced a new deal with Meta, in which the Facebook owner said it will buy millions of GPUs for its data centers in the coming years. At the time, the Nvidia deal raised questions about the future of Google’s talks with Meta, which The Information reported last year, but it isn’t clear that it had any impact. Another factor in the Meta-TPU deal could be Meta’s own struggles to develop and AI training chip, details of which The Information reported earlier Thursday. Some leaders of the Google Cloud unit previously suggested internally that supercharging the TPU business could help the company grab as much as 10% of Nvidia’s annual revenue—around $200 billion in the past 12 months, according to a person who heard the remarks. - <em>The Information article on Google-Meta deal</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, OpenAI’s expanded arrangement with Amazon hasn't just threatened its partnership with Microsoft. Because we know that Microsoft has been known to be struggling with deploying its internal homemade chips widely. So at least in the foreseeable future, Microsoft will likely mostly rely on Nvidia, or even its neocloud partners, focusing on deploying NVDA’s chip infrastructure. That will largely keep Nvidia chips in its orbit for a while. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, that isn't necessarily the same case for AWS. In fact, based on the latest reports, it suggests that Amazon is pressing on to expand the use of its custom chips, the Trainium 3 &amp; 4, to feature more prominently in OpenAI’s business. AWS has also forged a closer arrangement with the Sam Altman company not only for customized models, but also for certain enterprise AI agent products, taking a step further in an attempt to sideline MSFT’s early investments, as Amazon filled the gap that Nvidia arguably left (as they scaled down significantly from the previous $100 billion LOI). Furthermore, Amazon's terms indicate that the world's largest hyperscaler isn't going to scale with Nvidia chips as the North Star this time around, as it possibly believes its current footprint in cloud computing has the necessary penetration and deployment capacity to compete with NVDA and also Google. In other words, I think Amazon is seizing the opportunity through OpenAI to convince the world that its custom chips are now ready for prime time, not just for its own workloads, but also potentially for external customers to lease and scale, similarly to what Google has achieved:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/amazon-openai-reach-50-billion-investment-agreement?rc=3e6wgn\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon confirmed it would invest up</a> to $50 billion in OpenAI, in two stages, as part of a broad agreement with the ChatGPT maker that will expand OpenAI’s existing $38 billion agreement to rent servers on Amazon’s cloud service AWS by $100 billion and will involve OpenAI using 2 gigawatts of Amazon’s Trainium AI chips through AWS. Amazon’s cloud service, AWS, also will be the “exclusive third party cloud distribution provider” for OpenAI’s new enterprise focused AI management service, OpenAI Frontier, the companies said. The details in the agreement were in line with what The Information has previously reported. That includes Amazon investing $15 billion by the end of March and another $35 billion “in the coming months when certain conditions are met.” A securities filing by Amazon said Amazon’s obligations to buy the extra shares was based on the earlier of OpenAI “meeting specified milestones” and OpenAI going public. The Information previously reported the specified milestones related to OpenAI achieving artificial general intelligence, generally defined as AI on a par with human abilities. But the formal contract, included in Amazon’s securities filing, doesn’t make clear what the milestones are. - <em>The Information article on Amazon-OpenAI arrangement</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And if you think about it, questions about whether Nvidia’s moat could weaken due to this interference by its customers/rivals, and whether these efforts could really help them make meaningful gains against its ecosystem, are arguably justified. After all, Nvidia’s 75% gross margins do offer much potential for the market to digest if they could make the CUDA moat worth a lot less, or easier to crack than it appears to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now please don't get me wrong. I am not alluding to the immediate possibility that Nvidia’s CUDA is prone to disruption, far from it. What I'm saying is that, there is tremendous motivation, and even more so now as the free cash flow margins for the hyperscalers and big technology companies have been crimped as they expend close to the $700 billion dollar mark this year in CapEx. Note that for Amazon, the largest hyperscaler in the world, we could even be looking at negative free cash flow margins this year. So something has to give, right? Something has to go down for these companies to continue investing so aggressively in AI. Either Nvidia gives up some of its prized margins to the value chain, or these companies are going to double down on the efforts to diversify their reliance on Jensen Huang for future generations of their AI chips:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/amazon-tries-its-low-cost-approach-to-winning-the-ai-race-97c6c338?mod=hp_lead_pos3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon’s new artificial intelligence czar</a>, Peter DeSantis, thinks the company can use it in the AI race, where it needs a win after falling far behind competitors in developing cutting-edge models and popular applications for consumers and businesses. “AI has a cost problem,” he said. “If we ultimately want AI to transform everything, the costs have to be different.” Amazon, he said, has the expertise and the infrastructure to achieve that. Under DeSantis, Amazon plans to use its in-house chips to develop AI models more cheaply than competitors. It’s betting on strong demand for enterprise AI products that make up for their lack of all-purpose power with task-specific customization. And it’s still hoping that the large language model technology that powers chatbots can supercharge its Alexa-branded smart home offerings. - <em>WSJ article on Amazon’s low-cost approach</em></p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia Always Have Tricks Up Its Sleeves</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259010209151_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1365\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259010209151_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Nvidia estimates\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259010209151_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259010209151_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259010209151_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259010209151_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Nvidia estimates <span>(TIKR)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Which is why I'm not surprised that analysts are looking for even more clarity beyond just the first quarter. And I guess that's where the bifurcation and disconnect is. The market doesn't want to see just Q1 guidance. Obviously we know that Vera Rubin is on track for production ramp. However, the previous problems with the Blackwell architectural transition also led to an unanticipated snag last year. Even though it was resolved subsequently, I believe the market will be a bit more careful in trying to be overly optimistic on a highly successful ramp from the onset. Therefore, a more measured cadence in backlog digestion, and revenue conversion should be expected throughout the rest of the fiscal year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, while most of Wall Street are still <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">highly ebullient on Nvidia’s thesis</a>, they're still seeing a sharp slowdown from fiscal 2028. Now, these are potentially placeholder estimates, as the pace of AI evolution and chip developments is so quick these days, it's really difficult to prognosticate even beyond a fiscal year. As we have observed for ourselves, Google has quickly seized the zeitgeist from behind, and also Anthropic Claude Code has surpassed the wildest imagination and is now threatening to upend even the most prominent software leaders, and leave them biting dust.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But, while Wall Street wants more visibility into fiscal 2027, management isn't yet biting the bait, and I thought that was prudent. Because ultimately, Jensen Huang is under immense pressure to consistently overdeliver and outperform his peers, which is something that isn't new to him, and I believe that he relishes the opportunity:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p> Again, we're trying to look at revenue quarter-by-quarter. As you think about the full year, we are absolutely going to be still selling and providing Blackwell, probably at the same time that we're also seeing Vera Rubin come to market. This is a very great architecture that helps them just today quickly standing up and have already planned on many different orders across the different customers to provide that. It's too early yet to determine how much in terms of that Vera Rubin, that beginning ramp will start in the second half, and we'll get through it. But no confusion in terms of the strong demand and the interest. We do expect pretty much every single customer to be purchasing Vera Rubin. The question is how soon are we in market and how soon are they able to stand that up in terms of in their data centers. - <em>Nvidia Q4 FY2026 earnings call</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, amid all this ruckus going on right now, there is no doubt that Jensen Huang is still right at the top of the podium. Even AMD's latest offerings in inference aren't a close match for Nvidia yet, showing the gulf in standards between the two companies, which should sustain its ability to drive not just a technological advantage, but also its emphasis on cost efficiencies in driving down TCOs for its customers, big or small, hyperscalers, or enterprise:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>When it comes to the latest inference techniques that are used by the most prominent frontier large-scale inference services (such as disagg prefill+wideEP+FP4), Nvidia absolutely frame mogs with the B200, B300 and ASU frat leader, rack scale GB200/GB300 NVL72 across both SGLang and TRTLLM. Nvidia GPUs also dominate when it comes to energy efficiency, with much lower all-in provisioned picoJoules of energy per token across all workloads. Turning to AMD, we find that the biggest issue with inference on their systems and using their software is composability. That is, many of AMDs inference optimization implementations work well in isolation, but when combined with other optimizations, the result is not as competitive as one would expect. Specifically, the composability of disagg prefill, wideEP and FP4 inference optimizations needs significant improvement. While performance is competitive on AMD when enabling just a subset of the SOTA inference optimizations, enabling all three major optimizations that labs use, AMD’s performance is currently not competitive with Nvidia’s. We strongly recommend to AMD that they focus heavily on composability of different inference optimizations. We have been told that AMD will start focusing on software composability of FP4+distributed inferencing across their whole software stack. This will happen after Chinese New Year as most of their disagg prefill+wideEP 10x inference engineers are based in China. Nvidia’s GB300 NVL72 doesn’t disappoint. It achieves up to 100x on FP8 vs FP4 compared to even a strong H100 disagg+wideEP+MTP baseline and 65x on FP8 vs FP8. On H100 vs GB200 NVL72, we see up to 55x realized performance difference at 75 tok/s/user. Rack scale Blackwell NVL72 is framemogging hopper and makes hopper looks like it is jestermaxxing. As Jensen said at GTC 2025, he is chief revenue destroyer. At GTC 2024, Jensen claimed that Blackwell will deliver up to 30x perf on inference compared to H100, Jensen under promised &amp; overdelivered on Blackwell inference performance. This should curtail the instances of analysts cracking “Jensen Math” jokes for some time. - <em>Semianalysis article on InferenceX v2: NVIDIA Blackwell Vs AMD vs Hopper</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These things matter, because Nvidia must remain the industry standard given how large its market share is, and how high its gross margins are. As long as Nvidia can continue to stay ahead through hardware and software, it is challenging to imagine how its rivals could carve out a sizeable portion of its market dominance at the expense of NVDA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I'm not ruling out the possibility that these companies could continue to gain share as the market matures, the burgeoning and massive AI CapEx outlay corroborates my belief that Nvidia will stay on top of these growth levers. Moreover, let's not forget that the company has already put in place the infrastructure and framework to transition to growth drivers beyond the data center, including in autonomous driving, physical AI, and even potentially space based data centers, which we know is no longer just a fictional figment of our wildest imagination, if SpaceX's upcoming IPO confidential filings are anything for us to think about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And just when we thought Nvidia could really lose it this time, with peers on the verge of breaking new ground, I say, don’t bet against Jensen Huang. There's a good reason why they rushed into the \"non-exclusive licensing deal\" with Groq over Christmas, despite that eye-watering price tag, showing the tremendous shrewdness and market awareness of Jensen Huang and his utmost determination to stay well ahead in his market:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Nvidia plans to unveil a new processor specially tailored to help OpenAI and other customers build faster, more efficient tools, a major shake-up to its business that is poised to reset the AI race. The company is designing a new system for “inference” computing, a form of processing that allows AI models to respond to queries, according to people familiar with the plans. The new platform, set to be revealed at Nvidia’s GTC developer conference in San Jose next month, will incorporate a chip designed by the startup Groq, the people said. - <em>WSJ article on Nvidia’s plans for new AI inference chip</em></p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Buy Or Sell NVDA Stock?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259369795765_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1336\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259369795765_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NVDA price chart (long-term, monthly)\" width=\"640\" height=\"418\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259369795765_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259369795765_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259369795765_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259369795765_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">NVDA price chart (long-term, monthly) <span>(TradingView)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, before we dismiss the thesis that the market has given up on NVDA, I would like you to seriously contemplate it again. There is no doubt that NVDA has markedly underperformed its semiconductor peers over the past few months. In fact, if I were to do a candlestick counting on the long-term chart, this sell off has continued for seven months, with little respite for shareholders who attempted to even try to catch the falling knife.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But, as I mentioned earlier in my article, I indicated that we must take a longer term outlook when trying to assess NVDA’s price action. If you can see from the above chart, this looks just like previous pullbacks, multi-month in nature, but ultimately, nothing too worrying. The market has often found a sustained bottom when it retraced to the 50 month moving average (blue line), where the accumulation fervor begins to regain conviction again. And if you look at where we are right now, we are getting increasingly closer by the month. Note that, it has been almost one-way traffic for NVDA since the bottom against its peers in late 2022, which also coincided with the public launch of ChatGPT. Therefore, a well-deserved break that also aligns with profit taking among investors who were sitting on massive gains is more than welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you ask me, I will consider this a much-needed relief pullback, to set the stage for the subsequent recovery once the selling pressure has been firmly digested. With NVDA now trading at just &lt;26x forward earnings, it seems incredibly pessimistic when we take into account AMD’s 30x forward earnings and Broadcom’s 31x metric. The market appears to have given a lot of credibility to its competitors in gaining significant share against the king of AI, which could turn out to be premature and not validated. This disconnect in valuation between Nvidia and peers should close, in my opinion, and investors should not be too troubled about catching this retracement, as I'm confident that we will survive, and thrive, and see higher highs being taken out once the selling pressure has reached its nadir.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With NVDA’s price chart and comparison against peers now also having gone into the well oversold territory, all stars are almost aligned, suggesting that I can no longer ignore placing an even more bullish outlook on the stock while the market looks away in fear.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rating: Upgrade to Strong Buy.</p>",

As a local, you often end up putting the brakes on riskier investments because you know that in Brazil, complexity is high, political risks weigh heavily, and you<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> may even miss out on opportunities because of this.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, foreigners who are not so involved in day-to-day life tend to underestimate the risks a little, in my view. Of course, since much of the capital flow from investments in Brazil is driven by foreign investors, their opinion matters a lot, and even when they are “wrong,” they can often be right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most interesting thing is that with the rotation we are seeing, with capital leaving Mag 7s, often leaving the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"us\" htloopnumber=\"934745907\">US</em> in general, and going to emerging markets, the Brazil thesis is becoming even stronger, and the narrative that was previously negative is beginning to become positive.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bull Case For Foreign Investors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before I tell you the various reasons why a bull scenario is forming for the Brazilian stock market, we need to be aware of a couple of things first. During the pandemic, there was a lot of talk about the “party” (or, the celebration) of 200,000 points on the Ibovespa, which is the main stock index, that is, it was an important milestone for the stock market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But from 2019 to mid-2025, the Brazilian index remained flat, rising a little, falling a little, but very neutral in the end, and I think that shaped people's sentiment. I'm saying this because, in recent months, the index has performed very well, rising 53% in one year, and that's in BRL terms, not counting the devaluation of the USD, which would add more to this upside. I mean, even with the index close to the 200,000 mark, there is no optimism, no euphoria. Actually, it has been a very quiet bull market. There seems to be plenty of room for a bull market to really happen in the coming years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And this also depends on foreign investors. B3 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BOLSY\" title=\"B3 S.A. - Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão\">BOLSY</a>) is Brazil's only stock exchange. If we separate the categories, foreign investors account for the largest volume on the Brazilian stock exchange, obviously, if we separate Brazilian individuals, institutions, others, and then foreign investors as a single category. But even if we put all the domestic categories together, foreign investors still have a very large weight.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On February 24 (2026), foreign investors invested <a href=\"https://www.dadosdemercado.com.br/fluxo\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.dadosdemercado.com.br/fluxo\" target=\"_blank\">R$2.1 billion</a> in the Brazilian stock market, while institutional investors withdrew R$1.8 billion and individuals withdrew R$348 million. In January, the amount was R$26 billion, which attracted a lot of attention, so much so that B3 wrote an <a href=\"https://borainvestir.b3.com.br/tipos-de-investimentos/renda-variavel/acoes/estrangeiros-ingressam-com-r-2631-bilhoes-em-acoes-na-b3-em-janeiro-de-2026/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://borainvestir.b3.com.br/tipos-de-investimentos/renda-variavel/acoes/estrangeiros-ingressam-com-r-2631-bilhoes-em-acoes-na-b3-em-janeiro-de-2026/\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> pointing out that this was a record amount since the beginning of 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, 2022 was not a bull market in Brazil, but the interest rate was closer to 10% at the beginning of the year, and now it is at 15%, with no IPOs, and even so, foreign investors seem to be bullish.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And speaking of interest rates, this is precisely one of the arguments for a bull market. The interest rate of 15% is very high and restrictive even by Brazilian standards, and we are used to an environment of <a href=\"https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/monetarypolicy/selicrate\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/monetarypolicy/selicrate\" target=\"_blank\">high rates</a>. The good news is that by the end of 2026, the Central Bank expects something close to <a href=\"https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/focus/focus/R20260220.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/focus/focus/R20260220.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">12%</a>, and by the end of 2027 something close to 10.5%.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722324801814408.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Interest Rates - Brazil\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"441\" height=\"388\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722324801814408.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722324801814408.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Brazilian Central Bank</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is good for several reasons. As I am a fundamental analyst, the triggers for companies are great and clear: most of them have debt linked to Brazil's base interest rate, and if it falls from 15% to 10%, net income rises significantly. Also, with greater incentives for consumption, companies linked to the domestic economy should see an increase in their top line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But another very important point for the bull market in the short term is the investors perception and what it does to the capital flow and portfolio allocation. Today, there is a lot of talk in Brazil about earning 1% net per month without doing anything. Yes, just by leaving your money in the bank, you already have more than 1% per month, which is why those who were watching the stock market from the sidelines end up preferring to leave their money in Treasury or fixed income in general. Now, with this coming to an end in the next few years, those who still want the famous 1% per month will have to take risks. Not to mention the euphoria itself: if foreigners start to enter, interest rates start to fall, and the stock market rises, those who are on the sidelines and have very little money allocated to risky assets will also want to return to the stock market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So we can assume a potential rotation for Brazilian stocks both from foreign investors, who are leaving American Treasuries, leaving tech stocks and going for international opportunities, and from Brazilian investors who today have very little exposure to the stock market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, a mixed point, but one that I will include here in this section, is the P/E ratio of the Brazilian stock market. Some argue that this valuation is still fair and far from a bull market. I understand this view. The P/E ratio is ~<a href=\"https://www.oceans14.com.br/acoes/historico-pl-bovespa\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.oceans14.com.br/acoes/historico-pl-bovespa\" target=\"_blank\">13x</a> (TTM), and the peaks of historical cycles are much closer to 16x, 17x, so there is still some multiple expansion to happen.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-1772232480394199_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1150\" data-height=\"544\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-1772232480394199_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"P/E - Brazil\" width=\"640\" height=\"303\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-1772232480394199_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-1772232480394199_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-1772232480394199_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-1772232480394199_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Brazilian P/E <span>(Oceans14)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And if companies' net income really increases, this could trigger a much bigger upside than from 13x to 16x earnings, which would be a 20% upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, we have the political scenario in Brazil. The current president is Lula, whom the most experienced market analysts already know well, and for this reason, I think foreign investors are not too concerned if the opposition does not win. After all, Lula was president for several years in a row in Brazil, and this was during several bull markets. In addition, I think that Americans, in particular, were not so accustomed (at least not until a few years ago) to worrying about issues such as inflation and government debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, it may even be somewhat paradoxical, since while local investors are more cautious, foreign investors may arrive with abundant liquidity and go against the fundamentals, but at the same time, triggering optimism for local investors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bear Case for Locals</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Starting with the government, I think this is the main point that differentiates Brazil from other countries. Being here and reading Brazilian newspapers, we are constantly bombarded with various scandals and negative points about the state in general. And it is natural that concern increases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, if you talk to any serious political analyst in Brazil, they will tell you about fiscal concerns, since there is not much room in the public budget today, public spending is very high and growing, and new taxes are emerging all the time, such as the newest tax related to technology (check it <a href=\"https://en.clickpetroleoegas.com.br/brasil-aumentou-imposto-de-mais-de-mil-importados-e-ate-smartphone-entrou-na-lista-governo-fala-em-proteger-industria-mhbb01/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://en.clickpetroleoegas.com.br/brasil-aumentou-imposto-de-mais-de-mil-importados-e-ate-smartphone-entrou-na-lista-governo-fala-em-proteger-industria-mhbb01/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). So if there are no major reforms, either in terms of increasing tax revenue or the long-awaited reduction in public spending, the outlook for the public budget is definitely not the best, and this impacts interest rates, inflation, confidence in institutions, and everything else. Going into a little more detail, remember I mentioned that one of the triggers for the bull market is interest rates? If spending continues to be uncontrolled and increases more than expected, we are unlikely to see interest rates falling sharply.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of confidence in institutions, this is a critical point. Recently, the Banco Master case came to light, and I won't go into detail, but it's basically related to billion-dollar fraud, which at the same time diminishes trust in institutions such as the Supreme Court (check it <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2026-01-21/the-banco-master-case-the-2-billion-fraud-probe-that-is-shaking-brazil.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2026-01-21/the-banco-master-case-the-2-billion-fraud-probe-that-is-shaking-brazil.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). As written in <a href=\"https://www.cov.com/en/news-and-insights/insights/2026/02/brazils-banco-master-scandal-and-why-it-matters-for-foreign-investors\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.cov.com/en/news-and-insights/insights/2026/02/brazils-banco-master-scandal-and-why-it-matters-for-foreign-investors\" target=\"_blank\">Covington</a>, this also matters to foreign investors:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>“While there seems to be no immediate and direct impact, aside from the increased perception of corruption and political risk, there might be long-term consequences.”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this, in my view, does not make Brazil completely uninvestable. Even with all these uncertainties, there are still companies that manage to be profitable and really generate shareholder value, such as Klabin (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KLBAY\" title=\"Klabin S.A.\">KLBAY</a>), which has been around for over 100 years. However, all this uncertainty in Brazilian politics and institutions, in addition to macroeconomic risk, is very much in line with valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps you, as a foreign investor, see the P/E ratio of Brazilian stocks with an average of ~13x and think “dirt cheap,” because <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"us\" htloopnumber=\"934745907\">US</em> stocks are generally traded at 20x earnings or even more. However, 13x earnings is already high for the Brazilian context, especially when you consider that companies such as Vale and Petrobras have a very important weight in the main indexes and are highly cyclical companies, not to mention that Petrobras and other companies are at risk of state intervention.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To see this, it is worth taking earnings yield into account instead of P/E. Today, PBR stock is trading at 6.8x earnings for 2026. Seems cheap, right? Well, but that gives an earnings yield of 14%. Remember, Brazil's Treasury yield is paying 15%, and even if that falls to 12% or even 10%, is it really worth having a little more return to take the risk of owning a Brazilian state-owned company? And remember that Petrobras has already traded at a P/E ratio below 4x, so 6.8x doesn't really seem like a bargain to me; in fact, it seems that the equity risk premium is low.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I know that this may often not be an obstacle for foreign investors, who would <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"934745907\">buy</em> anyway, bringing in the flow and triggering a bull market, re-rating for these blue chips, etc., but I don't feel comfortable with this margin of safety, especially considering the risks that are masked by this high yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the elections, I believe that here people are much more afraid of a continuation of the Lula government than foreigners are. It seems too early to say who will win, especially since the candidates are not yet well established, but on Polymarket, Lula already has a ~50% chance of winning, which seems like a reasonable assumption, since the overwhelming majority of presidents in Brazil manage to get re-elected because they have the state apparatus at their disposal. As the market is unpredictable, it is difficult to say for sure that if Lula wins, the bull market will not happen, but in any case, it is one more obstacle, not to mention that volatility is to be expected as we get closer to the election.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722324803093069_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"985\" data-height=\"395\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722324803093069_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Brazilian Election\" width=\"640\" height=\"257\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722324803093069_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722324803093069_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722324803093069_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722324803093069_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Polymarket</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another point I need to mention is that I don't know exactly whether it is foreign investors who are overly optimistic about Brazil, or whether it is just a general rotation. Especially because, if we look at the indexes of other international markets, the EWZ does not stand out that much, but South Korea (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EWY\" title=\"iShares MSCI South Korea ETF\">EWY</a>) and Peru (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EPU\" title=\"iShares MSCI Peru and Global Exposure ETF\">EPU</a>) certainly do, and Brazil is only similar to Mexico (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EWW\" title=\"iShares MSCI Mexico ETF\">EWW</a>), which in my view is the main peer.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_542f91b876fc58e4041a23640591d095.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_542f91b876fc58e4041a23640591d095.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_542f91b876fc58e4041a23640591d095.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_542f91b876fc58e4041a23640591d095.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So I believe we should ask ourselves: are foreigners really buying Brazilian stocks because they are optimistic about the short term, or has only a portion of that money spilled over into Brazil due to natural diversification, ETFs, portfolio weighting, etc., while most of it went to other markets such as South Korea? If it is not widespread optimism, perhaps the bull market will not gain much momentum for now, so we will really need a second trigger, such as a more favorable election for a pro-market candidate or a real macroeconomic improvement.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How I Would Look At This As A Foreigner</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So I am left with this duality. On the one hand, I don't like the big Brazilian companies at current prices, but they are also the ones that could rise the most in the short term due to liquidity and strong foreign capital inflows. Consider, for example, that large hedge funds are not going to come to Brazil and <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"934745907\">buy</em> mid or small caps; they are going to <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"934745907\">buy</em> Petrobras, Vale, or not even that; they are going to put 5% of their portfolio in an index like EWZ and that's it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's basically what <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553189-brazil-for-druckenmiller-tepper-likes-ewy-berkshire-enters-nyt-13f-roundup\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553189-brazil-for-druckenmiller-tepper-likes-ewy-berkshire-enters-nyt-13f-roundup\" target=\"_blank\">Druckenmiller did</a>; he bought EWZ and call options in Q4 2025, but of course, he is a tactical investor. There are other types of funds that will look deeper and <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"934745907\">buy</em> stocks separately or make a more long-term investment, but in my view, the foreign “value investor,” focused on long-term holding, who wants to <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"934745907\">buy</em> Brazil is the minority of the minority. The majority will try to ride the bull market in rotation and leave in a few quarters or, in a better scenario, stay for a few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Incidentally, FLBR <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"vs\" htloopnumber=\"934745907\">vs</em>. EWZ is an interesting point that I may address in another article. Both are solid ways to gain exposure to Brazil, with EWZ having stocks such as Nu Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NU\" title=\"Nu Holdings Ltd.\">NU</a>), bringing greater diversification, while FLBR is more interesting due to its lower expense ratio and more stocks in the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, can ETFs such as EWZ and FLBR take advantage of this bull market? Definitely. But I don't think it's the best option. I would prefer to filter opportunities better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just to mention a little bit about the reason for this, I think Vale (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VALE\" title=\"Vale S.A.\">VALE</a>) is already slightly overpriced, but that's because I'm also bearish on iron ore, and as the stock has risen a lot recently, I think the margin of safety has decreased. Itaú Unibanco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ITUB\" title=\"Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A.\">ITUB</a>) is a great bank in terms of quality, but the price is already very close to fair value. It's something where you can earn Brazilian interest rates + a small coupon (like 2% or 3%), check out the article about ITUB <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4864107-ita-unibanco-when-15-percent-plus-a-year-still-isnt-enough-downgrade\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4864107-ita-unibanco-when-15-percent-plus-a-year-still-isnt-enough-downgrade\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But I think there are many more interesting opportunities in mid and small caps. I think Klabin is at a good price and is a high-quality company. Inter (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTR\" title=\"Inter &amp; Co, Inc.\">INTR</a>) is another small cap, Nu Holdings' main peer, but it trades at a valuation that is a fraction of NU stock. Not to mention related companies such as Mercado Libre (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MELI\" title=\"MercadoLibre, Inc.\">MELI</a>), which is not a Brazilian company, but is very directly linked to the Brazilian economy and is a company with very interesting prospects.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think my conclusion here, and perhaps you have noticed from the length of the text and the amount of information, is that Brazil is definitely more complex than it seems. Could a bull market occur in the coming years? Yes, but that depends on several factors, not just rotation, not just politics, and not just macroeconomics. For this reason, I prefer to be very rigorous in my stock picking when it comes to Brazilian stocks, especially at the current valuation, where the margin of safety is not the best.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, the opportunity in Brazil is not exactly in buying indexes, but rather in finding some good names that will allow you to ride this potential bull market, but with much less risk.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, the main ETFs in Brazil are currently much more suited to a hold rating in my opinion.</p>",

The report suggests the GDP to reach around $26 trillion before 2050, with per capita income exceeding $15,000—a significant milestone considering the largeness of the population and the current number. Even though these are projected estimates, they are capable of drawing the point about India’s forward looking growth prospects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/64152725-17722009221126797.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"India growth story\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EY India@100 <span>(EY Report)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While India has been on a structural growth trajectory—and that continues to be the case—the translation of that growth into investor returns might need closer examination. The point, as an equity investor, is how much of that growth can actually be translated into stock market returns, which are a function of current valuations and forward expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Long-term returns are a function of earnings growth, dividends, and changes in the P/E multiple. Betting on P/E expansion only makes sense from a relatively low starting base, which is not exactly the case here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a nutshell, while the Indian growth story may remain intact, how much of that ultimately translates into stock market appreciation needs to be examined. This becomes even more relevant for investors domiciled outside India, who must account for currency differentials, along with other associated factors. An investment that may appear attractive for an India-based investor could become materially less attractive for someone based in the US once currency dynamics are factored in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The exposure to India via ETFs</h2> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For investors based outside India who seek exposure to Indian equities, ETFs provide a relatively simple and convenient vehicle for participation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, when the performance of these ETFs is compared either with the underlying benchmark indices they track or just with S&amp;P 500, the picture looks materially different.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/64152725-1772188483585121_origin.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1294\" data-height=\"458\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/64152725-1772188483585121_origin.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Return Comparision\" width=\"640\" height=\"227\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"227\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/64152725-1772188483585121_origin.jpeg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/64152725-1772188483585121_origin.jpeg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/64152725-1772188483585121_origin.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/64152725-1772188483585121_origin.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NFTY generated cumulatively 132.02% over the last 10 years vs 247% for S&amp;P 500.

On an annualized basis, this translates to a ~5.56% CAGR for INDY and ~9.21% CAGR for NFTY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now observe this: the difference in returns between the Nifty 50 Equal Weight Index and the Nifty 50 has been roughly around 4% annually. Similarly, the return spread between NFTY and INDY has also been in the vicinity of nearly 4% annually. So, the relative differential remains broadly intact.

In contrast, the Nifty 50 is a broad free-float market capitalization–weighted index, where constituent weights are determined in accordance with the index methodology.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>NFTY – Equal-Weighted Nifty 50 Strategy vs</strong><strong>. iShares India ETF – Free-Float Market-Cap Weighted Strategy</strong> </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The structural advantage of an equal-weighted strategy lies in its inherent design, which functions as a mechanical rebalancing tool. By mandate, the portfolio must periodically trim outperformers and buy underperformers to maintain equal weights, effectively forcing a \"buy low, sell high\" discipline. Yes, it is cutting down the flowers and watering the weeds, and that works in this context.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While this approach is not a viable framework for active stock picking—since it ignores a company’s fundamental developments. However, it presents an interesting case for ETFs and index fund universe. Essentially, the strategy favours companies that are currently underperforming in terms of quotational price basis by increasing their stake while selling off those that have surged. It consists of an element of mean reversion— that causes a slight better performance than the broad-based capitalization weighted indexes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In that sense, NFTY has certain advantages over other broad-based capitalization weighted index traded funds such as INDY and similar others.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk &amp; Other Factors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most important constraint in any equal weight index is capacity—that is, the capital it can deploy under its mandate. As opposed to capitalization-focused indices, which naturally constitute weights by taking into account their tradable free float, an equal weight strategy necessarily allocates the same amount of capital irrespective of the size, volume, and liquidity of the underlying company. Thus, for any equal weighted mandate, as the fund size grows, this structure can mechanically increase market impact, execution friction, and tracking error, thereby reducing scalability and attractiveness. That makes it comparatively less efficient for sizable allocations relative to market capitalization indices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, as already mentioned, currency depreciation can meaningfully reduce returns for a US-domiciled investor even when the underlying entities are performing fairly well. Total return for such an investor is a function of both local equity performance and currency movement. The return attributable to a domestic investor would, in a depreciation cycle, exceed that of a USD-based investor. Currency hedging may be an option for some investors; however, hedges are neither costless nor particularly convenient to manage.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I believe the Indian economic outlook and growth trajectory to be in line with the expectations, I do not feel convinced about the attractiveness of broader stock market indices from the lenses of foreign investors. Neither I buy the narrative of the Indian growth story with reference to broad-based stock market optimism, and even if one does, once currency volatility and fluctuations are accounted for, the case becomes materially weaker for an investor domiciled outside India, such as in the United States.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, for someone who intends to maintain exposure to the broader Indian equity market regardless, NFTY offers an interesting avenue, providing an <em>equal-weighted exposure</em> to the largest enterprises in India.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I consider exposure via NFTY to be comparatively better than that <em>of </em>iShares India 50 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INDY\" title=\"iShares India 50 ETF\">INDY</a>) or other ETFs tracking the Nifty 50, unless the allocation size is a constraint. The Nifty 50 Equal Weight Index has a reasonable probability of continuing to outperform the traditional Nifty 50, and ETFs based on the equal-weight methodology may continue to reflect that advantage over some more time.</p>",

The concept simply was that with a few rate cuts in, and making their way through the digestive system of<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> markets, the long-lost private market sponsor component would be reanimated in capital markets. It was beginning to prove out among the advisory shops and the data in general as discussed previously that deals with financial sponsors were resuming. For Grosvenor this still hasn't really kicked in, and given that it's lagging the rest of the markets we continue the recovery in carried interest in the mix to be a latent effect that will help 2026 figures at some point. Until then fundraising at record levels, driven by their successful, idiosyncratic cross-selling strategy has been driving figures. In terms of the recent market wobbles around SaaS, we also note that Grosvenor has not been meaningfully exposed and may even benefit in their ARS (effectively alternative public markets or hedge fund offerings) businesses in the form of higher performance fees (</span><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1819796/000181979626000010/gcm-20251231.htm#i56b003f605cc42f6bbcec4a3b79d5eba_13\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">carried interest being the performance fees but for the private businesses</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> which are all ex-ARS).

This is consistent with private credit taking up more share and picking up the slack to keep the private category growing. Absolute return strategies or ARS have been flat over the last few years, but up recently. Hedge funds and other alternative, more public markets related AM has been sidelined for a decade now in favour of the massively growing private equity industry, which has been fundraising successfully and building dry powder even in these last couple of years when portfolio turnover has been really low. Hence private markets AUM has grown considerably as a percentage of the business over the last few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566499030092_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1034\" data-height=\"798\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566499030092_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"aum by strategy\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"494\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566499030092_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566499030092_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566499030092_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566499030092_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AUM by strategy <span>(Q4 Pres)</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566610981593_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1041\" data-height=\"805\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566610981593_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"fund closings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"495\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566610981593_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566610981593_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566610981593_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566610981593_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Fund closings <span>(Q4 Pres)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of more immediate results.

Performance fees coming from ARS are up YoY while carried interest in down. Seasonally, Q4 isn't usually the strongest quarter with Q3 taking that spot, but carried interest is really low here. We think the building unrealised interest does signal a considerable latent component as it's likely that realisations will start accelerating with costs of capital normalising, perhaps headed even lower once Powell is out and Warsh is in - <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-30/warsh-set-to-face-early-reality-check-as-trump-s-man-at-the-fed\" rel=\"nofollow\">although no assurances of that</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In general, we expect latent growth with 12% AUM growth but not yet fee paying AUM growth up 27% per year. In general, the cross selling strategy continues to be a major lever for the business' top line with 20-25% of fundraising in any given year having come from cross selling products to existing clients. Considerable operating leverage has been achieved and the company believes it can keep that OpEx at controlled levels.

Wealth management is only<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4868967-gcm-grosvenor-inc-gcmg-presents-at-ubs-financial-services-conference-2026-transcript\"> 5% of Grosvenor capital</a> currently and could be a lot more given that retail wealth is secularly underallocated to alternative assets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Grosvenor traded down together with the markets and they tactically increased their buyback by $35 million, meaning $91 million left in the programme. They also refinanced for $3 million in interest savings, which is alone a couple of pct points of net income in 2025. The dividend yield is not that low on Grosvenor either, and the buyback will reduce the cash burden from paying dividends to those extra shares. It's a constructive capital allocation strategy. In terms of valuation, the EV/AUM is around 2.6%. <a href=\"https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/PARTNERS-GROUP-HOLDING-AG-175123/valuation/\" rel=\"noopener\">Partners Group has around a 15%</a> as a PE and alternative assets comp based <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/earnings/partners-group-rises-5-as-2025-aum-hits-185-bln-sets-strong-2026-view-4448917\" rel=\"nofollow\">on their latest AUM disclosure</a>. It comes across as still cheap. We feel they should be able to monetise their AUM nearly as well as Partners Group in a low cost of capital environment.</p>",

Climb is a cash generator with a strong net cash position (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CLMB/balance-sheet\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CLMB/balance-sheet\" target=\"_blank\">$36.6M</a> in Q4/25). Share count has been stable, broadly speaking, and insider ownership is high, so interests are aligned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We see fair value for late 2026 at around $140 per share (from today's $90, a 55% valuation gap) as our central case, with a downside/base case at $120 (33% gap) and a bullish case increasing the target up to $160 (78% gap). </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business Description</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Climb is an intermediary between tech vendors and a network of <a href=\"https://www.climbglobalsolutions.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.climbglobalsolutions.com/\" target=\"_blank\">over 7000 </a>clients, who are mostly resellers consultants but also integrators or end customers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is operating a capital-light business, which selectively accepts to distribute the most innovative software to add to its current stack, and then distribute them through its growing network and partnerships.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Climb Channel Solutions is Climb's largest and fastest-growing segment. This is the main division that distributes the vendors' software, i.e. cloud, cybersecurity, AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Grey Matter is the cloud architecture division focused on migration and integration. It comes as a complementary service to Channel Solutions to help integrate the vendors' solutions in the end-customers IT environment. This is a more niche but high-margin business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Historically, Climb was distributing almost 500 vendors' technology, but was lacking a proper sales force and so was much more passive in its distribution. They had no vendor onboarding process, which was creating bottlenecks. Both factors made it harder to sign qualified vendors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Larger, famous, easy-to-sell software (Salesforce (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRM\" title=\"Salesforce, Inc.\">CRM</a>), for instance) was going to the larger competitors (TD Synnex (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SNX\" title=\"TD SYNNEX Corporation\">SNX</a>), Arrow Electronics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARW\" title=\"Arrow Electronics, Inc.\">ARW</a>), Ingram) as the latter had way more scale and brand visibility. Scalability was poor, and the offer had no real differentiation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following the pivot operated by Dale (cf. Investment Summary), CLMB is now targeting those niche software that are differentiated from the current market offerings, because the extent to which Climb gets paid depends on the adoption as they run on a fee-per-subscription model, which is why they want to focus on innovative products.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57996476-17721799112458928_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1426\" data-height=\"638\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57996476-17721799112458928_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Product Differentiation Climb Global Solutions\" width=\"640\" height=\"286\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57996476-17721799112458928_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57996476-17721799112458928_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57996476-17721799112458928_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57996476-17721799112458928_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Climb Global Solutions Investor Deck</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A strong element of the business model is that adding more selective products to the distribution stacks increases the capacity of Climb to cross-sell various products to the same clients, which is one of the drivers behind the company's potential operating leverage.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Thesis</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">a) Core Mispricing</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Climb is not only improving through volume expansion (gross billings up <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20414188-climb-global-solutions-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20414188-climb-global-solutions-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" target=\"_blank\">18%</a>) but also in terms of net sales (+40% in 2025). The divergence between the two metrics does not necessarily imply higher take rates, but shows they have a more central role in vendors' transactions (acting more often as a principal than an agent this year vs. last year).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Typically, a principal transaction recognizes gross revenue in US GAAP accounting, and an agent transaction is reported as net revenue. This can inflate net sales relative to gross profit, which is why we think the best metrics to look at to understand the dynamic of the business on a quarterly and yearly basis are gross profits and EBITDA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2025, gross profit grew 15.5% against 2024 (close to gross billings), which shows improving economics despite the change in revenue mix.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is confirmed by management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875352-climb-global-solutions-inc-clmb-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875352-climb-global-solutions-inc-clmb-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">saying</a> if you remove the Q4/24 one-off, higher margin transaction they had, organic growth in terms of EBITDA would have been in the high teens in Q4/25, the market basically thinks that Climb is still stuck in its traditional distribution model, capturing a small share of gross billings, having low growth, with lumpy revenues quarter to quarter.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">b) Strategic Positioning</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Climb's new positioning is that of a high-value-added model that is agile and unique, as they bring deep technical expertise to these more niche products they distribute and put a lot of commercial effort (webinars, marketing campaigns) into helping them gain traction, contrary to the more passive approach of the traditional players. For Climb, this active support enables them to capture more revenue per transaction for better profitability over time.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57996476-17721868492086375_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1500\" data-height=\"702\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57996476-17721868492086375_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Differentiation of Climb\" width=\"640\" height=\"300\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57996476-17721868492086375_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57996476-17721868492086375_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57996476-17721868492086375_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57996476-17721868492086375_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Climb Global Solutions Investor Deck</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Clients are satisfied because they are being pitched new, highly-selected solutions that they might not have been exposed to otherwise.

That said, as CLMB matures, management indicated that it is becoming less lumpy (no \"lumpy deals\" in Q4/25), and concentration is being actively reduced as growth was generated across a large set of vendors, not just CLMB's top ones.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the past few years, the average order size increased from roughly $200 to around $1500, according to management, showing a shift in scale. On top of that, they spoke about an 80 to 90% client renewal rate in Q4/25, indicating very low churn, with management targeting over 100% of renewal rate in the coming quarters. This gives a lot of visibility and improves the durability of gross profits. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond revenue stability, management wants to improve the operational efficiency of the business. The CEO mentioned in Q4/25 earnings 'call that they still perform roughly 12 quotes per order processed (meaning their internal workflow is still too manual). Management recognised this problem and hired a CIO whose mission, in part, is to introduce AI to streamline such processes. In the coming years, they expect output to increase \"by 50%\" with the exact \"same workforce\". The new ERP they just implemented is another meaningful step in that direction, as it helps standardize workflows and facilitate automation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This would be material for operating leverage and for the thesis, as a) our base case valuation model relies on improving EBITDA margins, but b) the bull case (more in valuation below) actually relies on the appearance of operating leverage, which will come from either higher gross profit per dollar of gross billings and/or faster gross profit growth than SG&amp;A growth through ERP/AI efficiency.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">d) Vertical Exposure</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As mentioned above, Climb's moat relies on its deep vertical expertise within key high growth markets. One such market is cybersecurity, which represents <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835451-climb-global-solutions-inc-clmb-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835451-climb-global-solutions-inc-clmb-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">over 60%</a> of Climb's sales. They mentioned they \"do not see weakness there\".</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another key segment for Climb is AI, where many emerging software vendors are positioning to capture the AI data center investment cycle. Climb believes it has a $20B Total Addressable Market there, before it \"reaches a ceiling\". They therefore believe they have a lot of room to grow from its roughly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20414188-climb-global-solutions-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20414188-climb-global-solutions-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" target=\"_blank\">$2.1B</a> of total billings this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Climb is also present in the Data Migration and Storage software markets.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">e) Vendor Improvement</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Climb recently signed two very significant vendors, which should provide significant runway in the coming years: <a href=\"https://www.fortinet.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.fortinet.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortinet</a> (large US cybersecurity company, a 60B+ market cap) and <a href=\"https://www.darktrace.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.darktrace.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Darktrace</a> (large UK cybersecurity company).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fortinet was signed in late 2025 through <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875352-climb-global-solutions-inc-clmb-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875352-climb-global-solutions-inc-clmb-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">direct C-Level access</a>, which shows that Climb is already being visible and recognized among the largest tech vendors. Climb is targeting in gross billings 10% of Fortinet's $2.5B TAM in the US, or potentially <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557935-climb-global-solutions-targets-250m-in-fortinet-gross-billings-within-18-months-as-m-and-a\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557935-climb-global-solutions-targets-250m-in-fortinet-gross-billings-within-18-months-as-m-and-a\" target=\"_blank\">$250M within the next 18 months</a>, which would be very meaningful against what Climb billed in 2025. Management expects Fortinet to soon become its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875352-climb-global-solutions-inc-clmb-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875352-climb-global-solutions-inc-clmb-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">top 3 vendor</a> in the US. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Darktrace, also in the early stage of market penetration, was already contributing to $13M in gross billings in Q4/25, suggesting a $50M annual run-rate already, with possible upside coming into 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These contracts should be very good drivers of billings growth, but such large clients tend to provide very good volume rebates to their partners if distribution is successful, which would be very impactful towards margins in case of success. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The pipeline of new vendors keeps getting bigger, as management indicated in the last earnings call that there is a \"<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835451-climb-global-solutions-inc-clmb-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835451-climb-global-solutions-inc-clmb-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">huge pipeline</a>\" of vendors doing $100M ARR in Europe and North America. Climb's very selective approach to vendors (in Q4/25, management said they assessed around 100 potential partnerships with vendors, only signing the top two promising ones) ensures they only distribute software platforms with high product-market-fit and adoption, which should continue boosting Climb moving forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As Climb naturally increases the number of products it distributes, it increases the cross-selling opportunities across its extended network, creating an extra compounding effect on growth. Grey Matter, the integration business of Climb, is also expected to benefit from a larger software portfolio.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">f) M&amp;A Flywheel</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Climb is choosing to also grow inorganically through acquisitions. The <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/08/07/2926122/0/en/Climb-Global-Solutions-Inc-Acquires-Douglas-Stewart-Software-Services-LLC-Expanding-Reach-in-North-America-and-Strengthening-Education-Sector-Offerings.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/08/07/2926122/0/en/Climb-Global-Solutions-Inc-Acquires-Douglas-Stewart-Software-Services-LLC-Expanding-Reach-in-North-America-and-Strengthening-Education-Sector-Offerings.html\" target=\"_blank\">DDS acquisition</a> it did in 2024 was <a href=\"https://www.climbglobalsolutions.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/224/climb-global-solutions-reports-second-quarter-2024-results\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.climbglobalsolutions.com/investors/news-events/press-releases/detail/224/climb-global-solutions-reports-second-quarter-2024-results\" target=\"_blank\">transformative</a>. It was fully funded in cash and contributed to revenue and helped increase EPS immediately.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This acquisition allowed Climb to gain a strong foothold in Europe, a fragmented market where there are <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835451-climb-global-solutions-inc-clmb-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835451-climb-global-solutions-inc-clmb-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">many sub-$200M distributors</a> but few significant competitors. A new acquisition was just announced a couple weeks ago with <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/02/24/3244037/0/en/Climb-Global-Solutions-Inc-Acquires-interworks-cloud-Strengthening-Cloud-and-Software-Distribution-Capabilities-Across-Europe.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/02/24/3244037/0/en/Climb-Global-Solutions-Inc-Acquires-interworks-cloud-Strengthening-Cloud-and-Software-Distribution-Capabilities-Across-Europe.html\" target=\"_blank\">Interworks</a>, a cloud distributor based in Greece. Climb bought them at around 9x Adjusted-EBITDA (8M euro acquisition price for 0.9M euro Adj-EBITDA), for a business that was growing its EBITDA 86% YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond the contribution to the top and bottom line, this move allows Climb to strengthen its bond with the Microsoft CSP ecosystem, and adds over 600 additional resellers and MSPs across South-Eastern Europe. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Climb's land-and-expand strategy is again immediately accretive without putting the company in much financial (the acquisition is paid for through cashflow, much less than the current cash position) or operational risk (Climb has been working with their team for over 10 years).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can expect this acquisition streak to continue as cash is rebuilding rapidly with the strong FCF that CLMB generates. One to two new acquisitions are expected in 2026, as per management, not counting Interworks' acquisition in February 2026, with a special focus on Europe, which, according to management, looks like the US space between 2006 and 2017, when massive consolidation happened. This implies that market share should be taken in Europe, now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a clean balance sheet, a successful track record of acquisitions, and the stoppage of dividend payments from 2026 onward, we believe this angle strengthens the capital allocation story.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span class=\"highlighted_text\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20414188-climb-global-solutions-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20414188-climb-global-solutions-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" target=\"_blank\">Q4/25</a> </span>saw the highest ever revenue in a quarter printed for CLMB at $193.8M net sales; YoY net sales went up a meaningful 20%. That said, Q4/24 had a significant one-off high-margin vendor transaction explaining why EPS remained flat YoY for the quarter at GAAP $1.52.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the quarter, gross margins as a percentage of net sales remained constant YoY at roughly 16%. As a percentage of gross billings, they went to just over 5%, when they were typically just below 5%. SG&amp;A remained flat at roughly 3% to 3.5% of gross billings over the years and across cycles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding<span class=\"highlighted_text\"> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20414188-climb-global-solutions-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20414188-climb-global-solutions-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" target=\"_blank\">full-year 2025</a></span> results:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net sales went up 40% to $653.3M and gross billings increased 18% to $2.1B. Gross profit grew 15.5%, less than gross billings (18%) and much less than net sales (40%), showing that revenue mix has changed, economics are stable but operating leverage is still ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, SG&amp;A should reduce as a percentage of revenue if Climb reinforces the economies of scale, improves synergies between the different business units, clears all redundancies between corporate entities following acquisitions, and implements more AI in its process (discussed above).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further down the Income Statement, GAAP Net income went up 15% ($21.3M) leading to a $4.64 GAAP EPS in 2025 (against a $2.73 EPS in 2023 and a $4.06 EPS in 2024).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Historically, Climb turns close to 90% of its EBITDA into Free Cash Flow, a very strong conversion, proving strong working capital dynamics because their customers pay reliably and vendors pay fast. This explains the strong liquidity of the balance sheet, which had $36.6M in cash and equivalents in Q4/25 and $0.2M in outstanding debt, and a $50M untapped credit facility. Plenty of liquidity as a buffer and as a means to pursue their M&amp;A strategy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue compounded significantly in the last couple of years, a strong sign that this business is behaving differently from its peers, and should warrant a different valuation multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Climb trades at a similar EV/EBITDA (9.3x) to TD Synnex or Arrow, even though it has a much higher YoY net sales and EBITDA growth than them.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><strong>Company*</strong></td> <td><strong>EV/SALES (TTM)</strong></td> <td><strong>EV/EBITDA (TTM)</strong></td> <td><strong>EBITDA Growth YoY (TTM)</strong></td> <td><strong>Revenue Growth (TTM YoY)</strong></td> <td><strong>P/E (TTM)</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Climb Global Solutions</strong></td> <td>0.6x</td> <td>9.3x</td> <td>38.5%</td> <td>51.1%</td> <td>20.1x</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>TD Synnex Corporation</strong></td> <td>0.25x</td> <td>8.4x</td> <td>10.15%</td> <td>6.94%</td> <td>15.9x</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Arrow Electronics</strong></td> <td>0.36x</td> <td>10.4x</td> <td>-5.63%</td> <td>10.49%</td> <td>14.1x</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Crayon Group Holding</strong></td> <td>2.05x</td> <td>16.9x</td> <td>21.24%</td> <td>7.65%</td> <td>46.7x</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>SoftwareOne Holding AG</strong></td> <td>0.78x</td> <td>14.6x</td> <td>-44.18%</td> <td>-5.93%</td> <td>N/A</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Average</strong></td> <td>0.8x</td> <td>11.9x</td> <td>4.01%</td> <td>14.05%</td> <td>24.2x</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Median</strong></td> <td>0.6x</td> <td>10.4x</td> <td>10.15%</td> <td>7.65%</td> <td>18x**</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>*The data in this table was extracted from the Growth and Valuation tabs on Seeking Alpha on 27/2/2026, for each of the companies in the peer table.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>**The median was the average of the third and fourth value, SoftwareOne Holding AG being unprofitable.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A reasonable EV/EBITDA multiple should be set depending on the growth of the EBITDA in 2026 (adjusted-EBITDA in the context of Climb). If our base case materializes (EBITDA margin remains constant and gross billings grows just as much as 2025, i.e. roughly 15% annually), then we could expect, on our assumptions, somewhere close to 48M adj-EBITDA in 2026. Applying the median 10.4x EV/EBITDA multiple would then give us roughly $500M of EV. Assuming $50M in net cash by year-end (given CLMB's current $36.6M cash position as of year-end 2025 with some FCF generation in 2026), this would give us roughly $550M of equity value or roughly $120 per share (a total of 4.6M shares) by the end of 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A more bullish scenario (the one implying the appearance of operating leverage) could warrant a higher multiple. On roughly 50M adj-EBITDA (higher adj-EBITDA growth) in 2026 this time, applying a 14x multiple could imply a valuation closer to $160.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A mix of both scenarios would yield a fair value somewhere close to the $140 mark, which is our central case (over 50% above the current price). This target does not require heroic assumptions; it relies on Fortinet's integration succeeding with possibly another small, accretive M&amp;A this year (management's track record suggests it should continue and is made possible by their significant cash position), slightly improving margins, and stable organic traction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Besides, Climb is still largely under-followed compared to peers (only has <a href=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/clmb/forecast\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/clmb/forecast\" target=\"_blank\">two</a> analysts following the stock), but we expect that the thesis will gather more attention as the structural transformation the business is undergoing becomes clearer. This should eventually help close the valuation gap.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some risks remain for Climb, despite its recent successes.First, software distribution remains a fairly lumpy business, because even if the trend has been upward YoY for Climb, some quarters remain comparatively weaker to other ones, sometimes expectedly so (Q4 typically being stronger as explained before), sometimes being less reliably predictable as one significant, one-short high-margin billings may fall a given quarter and distort the QoQ or even YoY comparison, possibly creating bad optics for those investors preferring visibility over volatility of earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Secondly, there remains a vendor concentration risks in the sense that a few vendors are representing a large proportion of revenues. This is a double-edged sword, as it also indicates that a successful partnership with a vendor can lead to very positive outcomes. Ultimately, vendor concentration is trending down as Climb structurally signs new emerging vendors and enlarge the technology stack it distributes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk could be an AI and/or Cybersecurity slowdown, as Cybersecurity is a major contributor to revenue, and AI is expected to represent a large TAM for the company in the coming years (with the rise of software orchestrating AI in data centers, for instance). That said, this can be said of any industry, and we believe these industries have a strong case for having real long-term tailwinds and significant traction in the coming years. Climb's diversification within these markets is also a way to remain \"on the edge\" of technological innovation at all times, which gives it downside protection if a particular sector within AI or cybersecurity were to slow down for a period of time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk is the possibility that competitors react aggressively to Climb's new strategy, of expanding to Europe, but above all to address the AI segment aggressively, which appears to be the market segment where there is the most room for growth (the $20B TAM ceiling described by management). This risk was actually discussed by management during the earnings call, but they do expect that so far they are flying \"under the radar\" to matter for its competitors, and so far they are addressing a different kind of market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There remains the risk of a failed acquisition. In the past, M&amp;A has been very accretive for CLMB, but this could stop the stock in its tracks in the event of a failed acquisition. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last but not least, net sales and gross billings can be volatile from quarter to quarter depending on the revenue mix. The main drivers of the thesis will be QoQ/YoY gross profit and EBITDA growth, meaning the cost efficiency gains and the higher gross profit per dollar of billing will have to materialize for the bull case to materialize. Otherwise the base case (EBITDA growth through volume growth) will remain dominant for 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CLMB has operated a successful structural transformation that improved its growth and gave the business a moat, which will be harder to replicate as CLMB becomes the go-to distribution specialist for emerging technologies in the coming years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The verticals it serves (AI, Cloud, Cybersecurity) have strong tailwinds, which CLMB can benefit from, all while benefiting from the diversification working with so many vendors brings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The business is scaling fast, yet costs have been kept under control while the balance remains clean, all signs that the business is operating a capital-light model. This enables CLMB to generate significant cash to further boost its growth through self-funded M&amp;A.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, this creates a gap between the business valuation and the estimated fair value across all metrics (P/E, EV/EBITDA) against peers, especially when taking growth into account. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The asymmetry appears favorable, especially if they maintain organic growth and continue their streak of accretive, non-dilutive acquisitions in less competitive markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We believe fair value as a central case lies at $140 per share by the end of 2026, meaningfully higher than the stock currently trades at.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

There will be a news story that everyone is talking about as something so important to the markets. Then, a few months later, it just disappears.</p> <p>Does<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> anyone remember First Brands? We haven't seen anybody talk about it for months, but back in October 2025, First Brands was the excuse for the market to sell-off for credit risk investments. In particular, \"private credit\" was blamed, and investments like BDCs, private equity, and alternative asset managers sold off significantly. Nevermind that the debt was mostly owned and originated by banks, and private credit had little to do with it – that storyline has disappeared.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now the market has focused on a new fear: AI and software. The current theory is that software companies aren't going to pay their loans because AI is going to disrupt their business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Certainly, AI is going to \"disrupt\" many businesses in a similar manner that the Internet disrupted many businesses. That's technological innovation, and companies will adapt their business models.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">No doubt some businesses might struggle with innovating and finding their path to provide value in a new world. That's life. Those who are lending first-lien senior secured loans to them, generally aren't the ones who end up feeling that risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When the market is fearful, it's time to go shopping for opportunities. Let's take a look at a few opportunities the market is giving us.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pick #1: ARCC – Yield 10%</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Ares Capital Corporation</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARCC\" title=\"Ares Capital\">ARCC</a>) is one of our favorite buy-and-hold \"forever\" stocks. It is a premium BDC that focuses on the upper-middle market. It is an investment that frequently trades at a premium to NAV, but has recently started trading at a discount to its last reported NAV of $19.94.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What has changed? Well, nothing. <strong>ARCC</strong> is doing the same thing it has always done. Credit quality remains consistent with non-accruals at 1.8% of amortized cost and 1.2% of fair value: <em><a href=\"https://ir-api.eqs.com/media/document/961648ac-d93d-400a-82fe-b11eb08b4390/assets/ARCC_Q4-2025_Earnings_Presentation_CLEAN.pdf?disposition=inline\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener\">Source</a> </em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-1770222266167449_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"298\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-1770222266167449_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-1770222266167449_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-1770222266167449_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-1770222266167449_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ARCC Q4 2025 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ARCC's leverage remains low relative to their historical averages, and well within management's target range:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-17702216721650317_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Table\" width=\"640\" height=\"253\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-17702216721650317_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-17702216721650317_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-17702216721650317_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-17702216721650317_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ARCC Q4 2025 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ARCC is doing the same thing that it has been doing for the past +20 years. One thing that has changed recently is investor sentiment. Investor sentiment is fickle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ARCC does lend to software companies. They account for 24% of ARCC's portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/16392-17716486734866388.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"573\" height=\"728\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/16392-17716486734866388.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/16392-17716486734866388.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/16392-17716486734866388.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ARCC Q4 2025 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This shouldn't be a surprise because software and services make up a very large portion of the U.S. economy, and lenders are going to lend to the businesses that make up most of the economy. ARCC's focus is on businesses that are in specialized niches with a fairly large moat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, one of its top 10 largest investments is in <a href=\"https://www.symplr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">Symplr</a>, a company that specializes in providing enterprise-level software solutions to healthcare companies. For a healthcare system to change their software is a major and expensive step. The hard part isn't creating the software, it's in creating and maintaining the customer relationships. Even though it's one of the largest holdings in ARCC's portfolio, Symplr accounts for 1.2% of the portfolio. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ARCC lends to over 600 companies. They are highly diversified and there will always be some of their investments that are struggling. That was true in 2005, 2008, 2015, 2020, and today. The business model doesn't rely on every sector and every borrower being in great shape all the time. ARCC lends money, underwrites the collateral, and makes loans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's why, after over 20 years and $70 billion of closed investments, ARCC's annual realized net loss rate is insignificant. <em><a href=\"https://ir-api.eqs.com/media/document/cd7a0000-da1f-49fa-8545-766897f2408b/assets/Q3-25_ARCC_Tearsheet_vF.pdf?disposition=inline\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">Source</a> </em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/21/16392-17716775137755632.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"437\" height=\"368\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/21/16392-17716775137755632.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/21/16392-17716775137755632.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ARCC Q4 2025 Tear Sheet</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So when ARCC is trading below book value, we are enthusiastic buyers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pick #2: OBDC – Yield 12.6%</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Blue Owl Capital Corporation</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OBDC\" title=\"Blue Owl Capital Corporation\">OBDC</a>) is a BDC that is managed by Blue Owl Capital Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OWL\" title=\"Blue Owl Capital Inc.\">OWL</a>). Over the past six months, we've seen the similarity in names cause quite a bit of volatility for <strong>OBDC</strong>. OWL has been garnering headlines for its investments in data centers and data center debt. Deals that have nothing to do with OBDC, but every negative headline about how \"risky\" these investments are seems to have an impact on OBDC's share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then, OWL attempted to merge a non-traded BDC with OBDC. The market threw a tantrum, and the deal was called off as the decline in OBDC's share price made it unpalatable. Many questioned the value of the assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, OWL just proved the value, selling $1.4 billion across three of its funds: OBDC, OTIC, and OBDC II, the non-traded fund. The loans are being sold at 99.8% of par value to pensions and insurance companies. The batch of loans includes a 13% allocation to \"software and services\" – the favorite sector for bears to be bashing these days. (OBDC's allocation to the sector was 11%)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, OWL just proved that their portfolio is worth well more than the market is currently pricing in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OBDC reported earnings with adjusted NII of $0.36 and book value at $14.81, generally in line with Q3: <em><a href=\"https://www.blueowlcapitalcorporation.com/_assets/_3a451672f8d635b71a9c090c3c6110b1/blueowlcapitalcorporation/db/2246/28360/earnings_presentation/Q4%272025+OBDC+Earnings+Presentation_vF.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Source</a></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714710437119172_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714710437119172_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714710437119172_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714710437119172_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714710437119172_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>OBDC Q4 2025 Supplement</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note that this does not reflect the sale of assets discussed above. That sale occurred on February 12th, 2026 and will be reflected in Q1 earnings. That's likely why OBDC is paying a dividend of $0.37 for another quarter, even though that is slightly more than earnings were in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management took advantage of the discount to NAV that OBDC has been trading at by buying back $148 million in stock in November/December 2025. They also announced a buyback program to buy up to another $300 million in 2026. These buybacks were at a price averaging 86% of NAV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This slightly offset the credit-related markdowns of $0.14 in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714711199758909_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"352\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714711199758909_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714711199758909_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714711199758909_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714711199758909_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>OBDC Q4 2025 Supplement</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The overall credit picture of the portfolio remains stable.

OBDC had its credit rating <a href=\"https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Ratings-upgrades-Blue-Owl-Capital-Corporations-senior-unsecured-rating-Rating-Action--PR_518465\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener\">bumped up</a> a notch by Moody's in January to Baa2. While their debt was already investment grade, being a notch higher will be a small benefit when they go to refinance their debt. BDCs borrow at fixed rates and lend at floating rates. Being able to refinance the fixed-rate debt at the lowest possible coupon is a long-term benefit for the company that improves earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When we bought OBDC over 5 years ago, we said we believed that OBDC deserved to trade at a premium to NAV. Then it did trade at a premium for a bit. Today, OBDC is a stronger company by every measure. It has better economies of scale, it has higher earnings, it has a higher credit rating, and it has maintained a similarly low credit loss rate. We believe that OBDC should be trading at 100-110% of NAV, which is $14.81-$16.29. That is fair value, and management just proved it in the most straightforward way possible, by selling assets to prove their worth. Our neighbors in the market are giving us an opportunity to buy it at a big discount.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When the market panics, look for the opportunity it is giving you. BDCs have been off to a rough start in 2026. In part, this is due to the reality that their earnings are normalizing. The rapid increase in interest rates created a windfall that we all knew wasn't going to last forever. BDCs borrow at fixed-rates and lend at floating rates, so higher interest rates produced higher than average spreads for them. That is over. We expect that earnings will continue to drift down and return to their historical averages.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They are still paying a high yield, even without the supplements, and there are opportunities to monetize their portfolio either through selling a portion of their positions like OBDC did, or as portfolio companies have IPOs, are acquired, or have other liquidity events. In periods of low interest rates, we tend to see more of that type of activity.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For those of us looking to buy and hold long-term, these BDCs are trading below book value, and they should be trading at book value or at a premium. We're buying.</p>",

In the last year, Nebius’s shares have already appreciated at a triple-digit rate and gained additional momentum in the last year and a half after Microsoft (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">MSFT</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">)</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4493205-nebius-rockets-after-inking-17_4b-deal-with-microsoft-for-ai-infrastructure\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> announced</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a deal to rent the company’s GPU infrastructure capacity to execute its AI projects.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, Nebius also faces significant challenges that could limit its upside in the future. The company has a capital-intensive business model that requires it to spend the available resources to build new data centers to meet the growing demand for its services. More importantly, since the business is unprofitable while the FCF is negative, Nebius needs to constantly access the capital markets to raise additional funds, which has already increased its debt load. If the hyperscalers decide to scale down their AI expenses or the macro environment worsens, there’s a risk that Nebius’s growth rate will decelerate. As such, we can’t recommend buying or holding the company’s shares right now and rate Nebius as a <em>sell</em>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Challenges That Nebius Faces Are Significant</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nebius specializes in building large-scale GPU clusters, which it later rents to other companies that are interested in using them to execute their AI projects. With the rise of generative AI, the demand for such services has skyrocketed, and it’s not a surprise that in<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4551025-nebius-group-reports-q4-results\"> Q4</a>, Nebius’s revenues increased by an impressive 546.9% Y/Y to $227.7 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the future, Nebius could now expect to generate over $3 billion in revenues annually in the next five years from the Microsoft deal alone. There are also<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4501230-microsofts-nebius-deal-to-provide-computing-power-to-internal-teams-to-ease-ai-crunch\"> reports</a> that under the deal, Microsoft would get access to over 100,000 GB300 chips that are owned by Nebius and will use them for its AI workloads. A similar<a href=\"https://nebius.com/blog/posts/digest-november-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\"> deal</a> that’s worth around $3 billion was signed with Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) a few months ago. While this ensures that Nebius will be able to significantly improve its top-line performance in years to come, there are nevertheless major risks with its business model that make investing in the company an extremely risky endeavor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First of all, by signing such deals, Nebius will take most of the risks associated with expanding the AI infrastructure. The deal gives Microsoft and Meta<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-02/microsoft-neocloud-deals-a-strategy-for-ai-supply-crunch\" rel=\"nofollow\"> financial flexibility</a> as they could pay for access to the computing power when there’s an increase in demand for its AI projects, and also not pay an enormous cost for building and maintaining a data center when the demand has fallen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, Nebius risks being left holding outdated GPUs that are quickly depreciating as more powerful chips are introduced. In 2024, following the success of its GPUs from the Hopper series, Nvidia said that it plans to release new AI accelerators each year. Last year, we already saw the ramp-up in production of its GPUs from the Blackwell series, and the company<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/25/first-look-at-nvidias-ai-system-vera-rubin-and-how-it-beats-blackwell.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> expects</a> to release accelerators from the Rubin series later in 2026. This could suggest that as more powerful chips are introduced, Nebius would be required to constantly spend resources on new GPUs to expand its data center footprint and remain competitive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We already see this happening since Nebius’s CapEx is expected to be in the range of $16 billion to $20 billion, an increase from $4.07 billion in 2025. The problem is that the company’s business is unprofitable and is expected to lose money in the following years. As such, Nebius is expected to access the capital markets for a while to expand its AI infrastructure. In June, it already raised $1 billion through the issuance of convertible notes. Then, in September, it began to raise an additional $3.75 billion through the issuance of new notes and shares. The problem with this is that it increases the company’s debt load and will likely dilute its existing shareholders. In recent quarters, Nebius’s total debt has already greatly increased. Considering that Nebius is likely to remain unprofitable, while its CapEx increases and the FCF remains negative, the company will likely continue to access the capital markets to scale its business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a big red flag for us, since there’s no guarantee that after all this spending, Nebius will be able to reach profitability and become FCF positive in the foreseeable future to avoid issuing new debt and shares. Some reports from last year indicate that even Oracle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>) struggles with improving the margins of its business that rents Nvidia’s chips and even loses money on rentals in some cases. In addition, with AI bubble fears on the rise, there’s a risk that if the demand for large-scale GPU clusters decreases, then Nebius could be left with lots of depreciating GPUs and a limited ability to turn things around and become profitable. That’s why we find it hard to justify a long position in Nebius, especially considering that the challenges that the company faces are on the rise, while its stock already trades at<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NBIS/valuation/metrics\"> exuberant multiples</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Real Value of Nebius</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering all the issues described above, we decided to create a valuation model and figure out the real value of Nebius in the current environment. In the model, our forecast period includes the next five years, and the perpetual growth rate that we use is 3%, which is close to the<a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/what-is-terminal-growth-rate/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> historical</a> inflation and GDP growth rate. The cash and debt<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NBIS/balance-sheet\"> numbers</a> have been taken from the recent earnings report.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The discount rate that we use is 10.12%. We figured it out by calculating the cost of debt and the cost of equity of Nebius. When calculating the cost of equity, we used the<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NBIS/income-statement\"> TTM</a> numbers for the interest expense and the total debt numbers from the latest earnings report. For the cost of equity, we used a<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y\"> risk-free rate</a> of 4%, a<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NBIS/peers/comparison\"> beta</a> of 2.05, and the<a href=\"https://www.officialdata.org/us/stocks/s-p-500/1950?amount=100&amp;endYear=2025\" rel=\"nofollow\"> market return rate</a> of 7.84%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177164371755_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1377\" data-height=\"385\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177164371755_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Valuation model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"179\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177164371755_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177164371755_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177164371755_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177164371755_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Valuation model <span>(Bears of Wall Street)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to sales estimates, we expect the company to continue to grow significantly in the years to come. The deal with Microsoft under the maximum extension alone would be able to generate around $3.8 billion annually, while the deal with Meta should yield around $600 million annually in the next five years. The management even stated in the latest earnings call that they’re on track to reach around $7 billion to $9 billion in annualized run-rate revenue, so the aggressive growth rate is expected. We reflected this in the model, and we also assume a continuous double-digit growth rate in all the other years, since in the same call, the management stated that the projects that they plan to implement this year could lay the foundation for the hyper growth in 2027 and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the bottom-line performance, things don’t look as good. The expectations right now are that Nebius will remain unprofitable in the upcoming years. Morgan Stanley expects the AI spending to deliver returns only by 2028. Considering this, we assume in the model that Nebius’s EBIT will become positive only in 2028, while in 2026, it’s going to be only slightly better in comparison to its<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NBIS/profitability\"> TTM margin</a>. The tax rate in our model is 15%, which is the rate we mostly use when valuing<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/bears-of-wall-street/analysis\"> other companies</a> from the AI field.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the depreciation &amp; amortization, it has been relatively high in the past, and we assume that that remains to be the case in the future. This is because the AI accelerators that Nebius purchases<a href=\"https://cernocapital.com/accounting-for-ai-financial-accounting-issues-and-capital-deployment-in-the-hyperscaler-landscape\" rel=\"nofollow\"> depreciate</a> fairly quickly due to the constant release of more powerful chips, which leads to a drop in the value of older chips.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to the capital expenditures, during the latest conference call, the management said that they<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869424-nebius-group-n-v-nbis-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\"> expect</a> the spending this year to be in the range of $16 billion to $20 billion. We reflected this in the model. At the same time, we also expect a major increase in spending in the following years. Let’s not forget that Nebius’s management in the same call also said that they expect to achieve 800 megawatts to 1 gigawatts of connected power by around year-end, and achieve over 3 gigawatts of contracted power by the end of 2026. Since it was also noted that the acceleration of the data center build-out will continue in 2027 and beyond, we could expect a major expansion of computing capacity that would require lots of capital spending in the future. That’s why we believe that the major increase in CapEx assumptions in the next few years is more than justified.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to the assumptions for the change in net working capital, they are not that far from the company’s historical performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Under all of those assumptions, our model shows that the enterprise value of Nebius is $18.69 billion, while its equity value is $17.48 billion. That translates to an intrinsic value of $69.08 per share, below the current market price by 30.09% at the time of this writing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177178394756_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2108\" data-height=\"748\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177178394756_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Valuation model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"227\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177178394756_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177178394756_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177178394756_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177178394756_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Valuation model <span>(Bears of Wall Street)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks To Our Bearish Thesis</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nebius’s stock could nevertheless appreciate further along with the rest of the market if the macro environment improves. The latest<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4551876-headline-cpi-inflation-rises-less-than-expected-in-january-core-cpi-rises-in-line\"> CPI</a> numbers suggest that inflation is not reaccelerating, which makes it possible for the Federal Reserve to continue to cut interest rates in the following quarters as macro risks subside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, the improving macro environment could prompt hyperscalers to continue to increase their spending on AI infrastructure to another record level, which would be beneficial to neocloud providers like Nebius.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While it’s possible that Nebius will continue to trade at the excessive multiples and its share price appreciates further, especially if another major deal is announced, we find it hard to justify a long position right now. Due to the excessive capital spending, the company is unlikely to generate any positive FCF in the next few years, and it will likely be required to once again raise additional capital that will increase its debt load even more. At the same time, at the current market price, Nebius doesn’t offer any decent margin of safety, while the risks that the business faces are significant. That is why we decided to rate Nebius as a <em>sell</em>.</p>",

Over the last two hours, it's safe to say that all of those diplomatic efforts over many years of \"strategic patience\" have gone up in flames.

Why? Indeed, if you think about it, the Israeli attack on Tehran, particularly given its proximity to sensitive areas of power (Khamenei's office and residence), represents a change because a \"red line\" that had existed for a long time has been crossed.

Iran is not an insignificant player in terms of supplying oil to the world. Iran is the 4th largest oil-producing country within OPEC and supplies approximately 11-12% of all OPEC oil production, which equates to about 3.3 million bbl/day of oil supply. Any disruption to the flow of oil from Iran (whether due to more stringent sanctions or damage to its infrastructure) would immediately shrink the size of the global oil market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772284063341022_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1340\" data-height=\"934\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772284063341022_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bloomberg\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"446\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772284063341022_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772284063341022_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772284063341022_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772284063341022_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The major issue, however, is a logistics issue</strong>.

This therefore means that if no complete blockage occurs, it will only take creating additional risk factors (mines, drones, GPS interference, etc.) or increasing the level of military tension in the area to slow the flow of ships and quickly increase both shipping and insurance costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think OPEC+, on its own, can’t solve the issue of price increases because if Saudi Arabia were to pump more oil, there are already alternative pipelines out of the Gulf, but they’re nowhere near as large as those through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait is so narrow that, while it’s possible to create some alternatives, it will be difficult to get enough oil out of the Gulf to replace the volume going through the Strait each day. As such, if the Strait becomes an operational constraint, the market may face a sudden supply deficit (a deficiency) that no amount of rapid production increases from OPEC+ can quickly make up for; thus, the risk to the price of oil is much greater now than would initially appear.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold, Equities, and the King Dollar</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The word of the day on Monday will probably be risk-off because during times of conflict or instability, the markets are always seeking shelter from the storm, so to speak.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dollar</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I start by looking at the Dollar (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DXY\" title=\"US Dollar Index\">DXY</a></span>). Although the U.S.A. is actively involved in this scenario, based upon historical precedent, the USD continues to be viewed as the safe-haven currency when the markets are stressed. It is the currency of choice for paying for oil and raw materials and for most other global transactions. Therefore, in the short term, I think we should anticipate a stronger dollar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285172258975_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"926\" data-height=\"526\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285172258975_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bloomberg\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"364\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285172258975_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285172258975_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285172258975_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285172258975_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAUUSD:CUR\">XAUUSD</a>) should act like it usually does during a period of chaos and provide investors with some protection from the uncertainties that are currently affecting the market. The fact that gold hit an all-time price before the most recent tensions indicates that the markets have already begun to account for this type of tension. If the instability continues, I think you may see additional increases in the price of gold. However, due to the large degree of volatility that is associated with the type of rapid increase in the price of gold, I think it would be prudent to use caution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285195626483_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2010\" data-height=\"1239\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285195626483_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bloomberg\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"395\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285195626483_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285195626483_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285195626483_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285195626483_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Equities</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most key component is the sensitivity of stocks over the short term, i.e., an extremely negative opening price resulting from uncertainty could cause investors to flee to safe havens.

However, the scope of the operation appears to extend beyond that of a surgical attack. It appears as if the mission is a much broader effort, as opposed to a limited engagement to eliminate the Iranian capability for a nuclear weapons program, the missile delivery systems, and the naval capabilities. The objective of this operation is more akin to an attempt to create regime change rather than an operation that is limited in its objectives. As we have seen in <strong>Iraq</strong>, <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, and <strong>Libya</strong>, we should remember that having air superiority is rarely sufficient to bring down an established government.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-17722857759233696_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1515\" data-height=\"777\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-17722857759233696_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bloomberg\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"328\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-17722857759233696_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-17722857759233696_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-17722857759233696_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-17722857759233696_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Iran may fall into a \"<strong>survival mode</strong>\" that could last for months or even years, based upon how long it takes for the current Iranian Government to fall. The most vulnerable and riskiest chokepoint in the global economy would likely be the Strait of Hormuz, because Iran has about <strong>90 million residents</strong> and an internally fractured opposition movement. Thus, a long-term situation of turmoil is by no means out of the question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think, among the other indicators I have mentioned, there is also the possibility that the global financial markets will experience a strong downturn followed by a quick rebound from that downturn as a result of an elimination of the current political uncertainties. If instead, however, the \"<strong>survival-and-chaos</strong>\" scenario prevails with sustained tension surrounding Hormuz, the most relevant macroeconomic risk factors for the global economy will be pressure on oil prices, potential inflationary pressures, and a lower rate of economic growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We are only at the end of this weekend, and with all of these types of scenarios, it’s usually better to wait than anticipate. The first real read on Monday will come from the closing numbers. If support breaks down and does so significantly, then liquidity will once again be the most important commodity.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>We need to continue to monitor the situation.</strong></p>",
