My view has changed. While<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the valuation multiple is still high, I now believe multiples could continue staying at this level given the growth momentum, upgraded guidance, and tangible catalysts.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWI reported a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20281401-armstrong-world-industries-reports-third-quarter-2025-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A1\">strong Q3</a> that really changed my mind on the business and outlook. Total net sales grew 10% y/y to $425.2 million, setting a new third-quarter high. The Mineral Fiber [MF] segment saw 6.2% y/y growth, driving sales to $274 million. While most of the growth came from favorable pricing and mix ($14 million contribution), volume contributed too, which was positive as this marks the second consecutive quarter of positive volume growth. And this does signal that the demand backdrop is recovering. As for the Architectural Specialties [AS] segment, it remained as the core growth driver, with net sales up 17.6% y/y to $151.2 million. To be fair, ~$16 million came from the 3form and Zahner acquisitions, but even if we adjust for these, organic sales still grew $7 million, or 6% y/y, and this is despite tougher comps. Margins were the only negative takeaway here. Consolidated adj. EBITDA margin contracted 120 bps to 34.7%, with both MF and AS seeing margin contraction. Anyway, I don’t think much attention should be paid to this margin pressure since the real takeaway is the 13.3% y/y EPS growth to $2.05.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth Accelerates, Justifying the Premium</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I last covered AWI, my hold rating was driven almost entirely by valuation. The stock looked expensive, and I wasn’t convinced there was enough room for upside surprise. After seeing the 3Q25 results and, more importantly, the upgraded outlook, I believe I have been too conservative previously. It seems clearer to me that the AWI growth story is actually getting much better, which justifies its premium multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key update here, I think, is management’s decision to raise FY2025 adj. EPS guidance. The new guide calls for a range of $7.45–$7.55, which implies 18%–20% y/y growth. Management also effectively dismissed the bear case (poor volume demand) for the MF segment by calling the market stabilizing and raising the FY2025 volume outlook. Remember that Q3 ended on 30th September, and the results came out just yesterday, which means management already had one full month of data (for Q4). This makes the volume guide credible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aside from the guide, AWI’s digital strategy continues to show its worth. I said before that this is a competitive edge, and AWI proved me right this quarter. The new highlight this quarter is Kanopi, an e-commerce platform that saw record sales and EBITDA. This is noteworthy because it confirms AWI’s ability to reach smaller and previously underserved customers profitably. The keyword is profitably, because anyone can chase after volume by heavily subsidizing it, but doing it profitably means that AWI has built a platform that can efficiently handle these smaller customers’ orders (low-volume orders, so it is hard to make the unit economics work vs. a large-volume order, as fixed cost is spread over a smaller base). From a growth perspective, this means AWI's growth runway has extended longer, as it can now go after the long tail of demand (e.g., demand from smaller contractors that typically require more niche products). Or you can just think of this as AWI expanding its total addressable market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the ProjectWorks design platform continues to gain traction as I expected. For recap, my general view was that ProjectWorks simplifies complex designs and installations, and that makes the life of architects easier, which drives adoption. However, it seems like I am missing a part of the story. Management noted another benefit that I thought was very bullish. This ProjectWorks design platform doesn’t just make the life of architects easier; it also addresses the problem of <a href=\"https://www.agc.org/news/2025/08/28/construction-workforce-shortages-are-leading-cause-project-delays-immigration-enforcement-affects\" rel=\"nofollow\">labor shortages in construction</a>. By automating design rules and stepping up the pace of iterations, ProjectWorks actually increases productivity for contractors as well. Rather than directly reducing the number of labor contractors needed, it drives efficiency by reducing “wasted attempts.” Better design rules and iterations result in precise bills of materials that reduce the frequency of rework.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another potential growth catalyst is the office segment, which represents ~30% of AWI’s total demand. Most readers would know that the office segment has been a drag on the business ever since Covid (more work-from-home policy that reduces the need for office spaces). However, we may have reached an inflection point. For the first time in seven years, US office vacancy rates have moved lower (per a third-party data cited by management during the call). This is too early to call it a recovery trend, but it does support the narrative of the ongoing <a href=\"https://archieapp.co/blog/return-to-office-statistics/#elementor-toc__heading-anchor-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">return-to-office trend</a>. AWI is already seeing early benefits, with increasing tenant improvement projects in its order flow. Tenants wouldn’t spend capex to improve if they are not seeing improving end demand. In my view, this could be a meaningful swing factor. Even if the office market simply stabilizes, it removes an overhang on the stock, and in the bull case, if it becomes a tailwind, it could unlock incremental volume and operating leverage.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance sheet and capital allocation</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1664\" data-height=\"855\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A screen shot of a graph AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"329\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095102663074_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the balance sheet, I don’t see much of a problem for AWI to continue reinvesting for growth. The business is generating a good amount of cash (adj. free cash flow is up 22% year-to-date), allowing it to fund growth without tapping hard into leverage. In fact, the business is generating so much cash that in Q3 alone, management raised its dividend by 10%, repurchased $27 million of stock, and even did a bolt-on acquisition (bought <a href=\"https://www.armstrongceilings.com/commercial/en/press-releases/armstrong-acquires-geometrik.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geometrik</a> for $7.5 million). I am not incorporating this into my base case, but there is a potential for AWI to re-lever up its balance sheet back to the historical leverage ratio (&gt;1x EBITDA) and return that cash to shareholders.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"792\" data-height=\"462\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"373\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-1761809510045725_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Value Sights</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My view on the stock has changed for the better. I think there is a good chance that AWI will continue to grow as low-teens (FY25 13% was guided), and if we keep margins flat, earnings could grow to $470 million in FY28, and that solid growth (relatively better than peers, as shown below) should continue to justify multiples to stay at the current premium elevated level (23x forward PE vs. peers with an average of 12x). While I noted that the last time this happened, the multiples re-rated downwards quickly, I think this time may be different. There are visible growth catalysts that could continue to support growth. Also note that the recovery in the office segment could elevate growth higher.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095100530143.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"383\" height=\"277\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095100530143.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095100530143.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095100530143.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095100530143.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095100530143.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095100530143.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095100530143.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618095100530143.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">LTM sales growth <span>(Bloomberg)</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are execution risks that could hurt growth. Specifically, the AS segment growth still depends on successfully integrating 3form and Zahner, which are currently weighing on segment margins. If the synergies are lower than expected, earnings growth could be weaker than I expected. On costs, about $6 million in Q3 operating expenses were one-off expenses that management called out as timing-related, and we should see a sequential improvement in cost. The risk here is that ongoing inflation, especially in energy prices, could mask this “improvement,” and the market may inch closer to being conservative when modelling margins (I am modelling flat; they may model declining margins).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am upgrading my rating on AWI to buy. My previous view that valuation was too high is no longer the case given the growth momentum and raised guidance. The digital strategy also continues to work, with Kanopi and ProjectWorks showing tangible results. There is also the office space segment that is finally showing signs of inflecting into a tailwind. All in all, I can bridge to a nice upside case if AWI can continue to grow at low teens with a 20% net margin.</p>",

And more stock buybacks are likely to get executed in Q4... which should especially benefit the Search business given the inclusion of the holiday period. Going forward, I expect Google to invest more money into:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The development of new AI-driven products, such as AI queries, which are integrated into Search and Cloud and which accelerate Google's growth in the core business</li> <li>Data Centers in order to accommodate soaring demand for AI-driven workloads. In this regard, Google just <a href=\"https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/2025q3-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">raised its FY 2025 CapEx outloo</a>k from $85.0B to a new range of $91-93B and the company has guided for a significant CapEx boost next year.</li> <li>Stock buybacks. The tech company may boost its stock authorization next year and potentially increase its buyback size (from a current $70B authorization) if free cash flow performance remain strong</li> <li>The acquisition of AI start-ups. In order to accelerate its AI-centric growth strategy in Search and Cloud, Google may turn to a more acquisition-focused approach to boosting its top line growth.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Google’s valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the past, I recommended Alphabet chiefly because the company was the cheapest big tech stock, despite delivering double-digit top line growth and being highly profitable. Shares of Alphabet are currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25.7X, but are still relatively cheap compared to other big tech companies in the industry group... many of whom trade a significantly higher earnings multipliers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As revaluation catalysts for Google I see 1) Accelerating AI spending in the enterprise market which could drive results in Cloud especially, 2) Expanding operating income profitability, driven by AI product up-take in Cloud, and 3) Strength in digital advertising spending backing up the firm’s largest segment (Search), especially in the fourth-quarter... which is typically a strong one for companies selling digital ads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, shares of Alphabet could revalue to a ~30X P/E ratio fairly easily... under the condition that Alphabet continues to grow at double-digit rates and CapEx spending in the enterprise market doesn’t slow. Google is currently expected to generate $10.73 per-share in earnings in FY 2026, implying 8% Y/Y growth, which calculates to a fair value of $322 per-share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3ae31d25e1ae44be2c1a14fcd5e111c9.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3ae31d25e1ae44be2c1a14fcd5e111c9.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3ae31d25e1ae44be2c1a14fcd5e111c9.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3ae31d25e1ae44be2c1a14fcd5e111c9.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3ae31d25e1ae44be2c1a14fcd5e111c9.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3ae31d25e1ae44be2c1a14fcd5e111c9.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3ae31d25e1ae44be2c1a14fcd5e111c9.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3ae31d25e1ae44be2c1a14fcd5e111c9.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3ae31d25e1ae44be2c1a14fcd5e111c9.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks with Google</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest risk for Alphabet, as I see it, relates to a potential slowdown in AI-driven CapEx spending in the enterprise market which could hurt the company’s growth momentum in the Cloud business. What would therefore potentially negatively impact my bullish view on the technology firm is if the firm's stellar Cloud-driven growth moderated or if Google saw a deterioration of its free cash flow margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The firm's strong FCF is key to Google's AI-driven CapEx ramp as well as stock buybacks, so any deterioration in the fundamentals of the core digital advertising market is likely going to have a severe valuation impact on Google's stock outlook.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Google has received a steady stream of positive results in the last several months including a favorable court ruling regarding its Chrome browser which pushed shares into a new up-leg.... and now the company has submitted an earnings scorecard that crushed Wall Street's estimates. </p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Google is well-positioned as one of the largest public Cloud platforms to cash in on AI-driven Cloud growth and the company is seeing impressive operating income growth. Google's strong Q3 earnings report highlighted robust growth momentum in both Search and Cloud and strength in free cash flows... which is likely going to add to investors' already positive sentiment about the company. After the earnings report, shares of Google soared 7% in the after-hours market, but I see more room for shares to appreciate.</p>",

Adjusted gross profit was down a more modest 4%, while income from operations actually grew by 23% thanks to significant cost discipline. Global shipping rates continue to fall, driving the revenue decline, and Europe has also been a source of weakness. In contrast, CHRW continues to meaningfully gain market share in the U<span>nited States</span>, boosting revenue. As noted on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835094-c-h-robinson-worldwide-inc-chrw-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835094-c-h-robinson-worldwide-inc-chrw-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">earnings call</a>, freight activity has weakened for 12 straight quarters, with Q3 the worst Q3 since 2009. CHRW’s solid results in this macro backdrop speak to its continued market share gains, as well as its extremely impressive cost management.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">CHRW gains share and margins in U.S. trucking</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">North American Surface Transportation (“NAST”) is its largest segment, accounting for about 63% of firmwide gross profit. Volumes grew by 3%, and operating margins expanded for an eighth straight quarter to 39%, approaching its 40% mid-cycle target. Both Truckload and LTL (“less than truckload”) were up about 3%. CHRW estimates that the market declined by 7% in the quarter, so we are seeing the company’s investments in technology meaningfully expand its market share. Adjusted gross profit rose by 6% to $444 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CHRW generated 8% more gross profit per LTL order while it held gross profit flat per truckload order, a resilient performance despite pricing pressure. The ability to gain market share while also enhancing margins continues to be impressive. As you can see below, gross margins have been steadily increasing and are essentially at the highest level since before COVID. However, the dollar value of gross profit per shipment remains depressed, just given the weakness in the U.S. trucking market. If we eventually see an upturn in the trucking market, there should be meaningful gross profit upside. Unfortunately, given sluggish economic activity, I do not see this occurring within the next 12 months.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1089\" data-height=\"385\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph of a graph AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"226\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104707208_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>C.H.

Still, the weak global shipping environment is weighing as tariffs reduce trade volume. As a result, gross profit fell by 18% from last year, as ocean volumes fell by 7% and air declined by 10%. As you can see below, the majority of this business is tied to ocean freight, and that market is extremely challenged, with gross profit down by nearly a third to $111 million. The ongoing conflict in the Red Sea also has forced vessel rerouting along more expensive and time-consuming routes, a structural challenge that appears unlikely to end soon.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104582272.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A screenshot of a blue and white table AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"433\" height=\"335\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104582272.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104582272.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104582272.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104582272.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104582272.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104582272.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104582272.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618285104582272.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>C.H. Robinson</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, gross profit per ocean shipment fell by 27%. Gross profit per air shipment rose by 17%, helping to offset volume declines, and mix shift led to a 31% jump in gross profit per customs transaction. Still, these segments are too small to offset pressure in Ocean freight, and I expect global trade activity to remain muted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, aside from stronger earnings, sentiment around CHRW is likely being boosted this morning by the conciliatory U.S.-China <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/trump-cuts-fentanyl-tariffs-on-china-to-10percent-says-us-reached-rare-earths-deal-.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/trump-cuts-fentanyl-tariffs-on-china-to-10percent-says-us-reached-rare-earths-deal-.html\" target=\"_blank\">meeting</a> overnight whereby the United States agreed to tariff rates of 47% from 57%, and China agreed to delay rare earth export controls. Tariff rates are still high, which will continue to greatly restrict U.S.-China trade in my view. All else equal, increased trade between the U.S. &amp; China will benefit CHRW’s business, so the fact that the two countries chose de-escalation over escalation is a positive.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cost performance impresses</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its Lean AI initiative continues to deliver cost efficiencies. The company continues to increase its use of “AI agents” to provide quotes, take orders, connect with carriers, and manage payments. By continuing to automate tasks that were previously done manually by employees, we are seeing the company generate meaningful savings. In fact, average employee headcount is down nearly 11% from last year, and operating expenses fell by 13% to $485 million. CHRW’s technology spending is creating clear efficiency savings.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"896\" data-height=\"446\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"319\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510514522_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>C.H. Robinson</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the quarter, CHRW bought back $115 million of stock. The company maintains an excellent balance sheet with just 1.2x debt/EBITDA leverage and ~$1.2 billion of long-term debt. With leverage coming down, management expects more share repurchases over the next year. Between its dividend and buyback, I expect at least $600 million of capital returns next year, or at least $5.50/share. Aside from buybacks, CHRW pays a 1.9% dividend yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far this year, the company has generated $554 million of free cash flow. Back in April, I was targeting $550-$650 million of free cash flow. With margin performance exceeding my expectations and the tariff outcome not as bad as feared in April, I now see CHRW generating about $670-$720 million of free cash flow this year, depending on working capital movements, or about $6 per share.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation prices in the good news</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alongside results, management boosted its 2026 outlook by $50 million to $965 million to $1.04 billion, representing about $6 per share in EPS in an environment where there is zero end-market growth. While 0% growth does not usually seem like an optimistic assumption, that would be a marked improvement from this year. While much of the tariff headwind should already be in results, I see limited scope for volume growth. The company sees about $120 million of savings benefits next year, driving much of its operating income growth.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"793\" data-height=\"381\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A chart of a diagram AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"307\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-1761828510703881_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>C.H.

Frankly, I am cautious about the freight market turning positive next year. While we may have passed peak tariff pressures, economic activity remains muted. Plus, with NAST approaching mid-cycle levels even in a down market, I suspect that the majority of the margin gains have already occurred. After today’s rally, shares appear to be pricing in the good news. That said, with trade sentiment improvement and buybacks likely to accelerate, the environment should remain favorable towards CHRW. As such, I am downgrading shares to a “<span>H</span>old.” I see no rush to <span>\"S</span>ell,\" but shares are pricing in much of the good news already.</p>",

The market is expected to grow annually by 7.07% (CAGR 2025-2030).</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If this +7% CAGR forecast comes true, I think it could certainly be an upside factor for firms like this one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, when it comes to certain fruits like bananas, FDP fills a demand that simply cannot be produced in certain parts of the world due to unfavorable climate. For instance, SA analyst <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802637-fresh-del-monte-produce-stock-well-positioned-to-stay-fresh\">Waterside Insight</a> pointed out in their July article on this firm:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Almost 80% of its sales go to North America and Europe, where these fruits are not suitable to grow locally, except for the southern part of the US and Mexico.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, the laws of supply and demand impact this industry, as an oversupply of any fruit or vegetable could be a future downside for a company like this, whereas a shortage could work in its favor. Investors should consider that dynamic when considering this sector. For example, back in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/eat/humid-growing-conditions-lead-to-an-oversupply-of-bananas-priced-at-150kg/news-story/5f62bbf126f6433006fd125d3260cb73\" rel=\"nofollow\">Australian news</a> highlighted how past cyclones caused a banana shortage:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Most banana growers took a big hit and there was not much supply around, so the growers who did have supply, they made a lot of money.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FDP/growth\">forward revenue growth</a> for this firm is expected to be a mere +1.2%, 55% below its sector average, so that certainly could be a concern to investors putting more weight on the top line results:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58572054-17618156200444124_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"696\" data-height=\"106\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58572054-17618156200444124_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"FDP -

It poses a threat to large commercial producers as well as small-scale local production.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe a mitigating factor that could favor FDP is that it not only is diversified across multiple products (not just bananas) but also uses multiple farms and supply-chain networks globally, so those could mitigate some of this risk, as opposed to a company with a single farm and product whose crop gets wiped out and it cannot sell it to the market.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, my call to action to readers, to conclude today's discussion, is to keep considering Fresh Del Monte if you want some portfolio exposure to this sector for the purpose of diversification, as well as a dividend income opportunity.</p>",

The company has one recently approved product, Palsonify, which is in the clinic pursuing a second indication, as well as another program addressing two other hormonal conditions. Crinetics was formed in 2008 and went public in 2018, raising net proceeds of $106.5 million at $17 per share. Its stock trades around $42.00 a share, translating to a market cap of just less $4 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s development approach is to target endocrine indications with low patient populations and high unmet need where the clinical trials employ biomarkers (such as hormone levels) as primary endpoints with proof-of-concept established by solid pharmacokinetics in healthy patients during Phase 1 studies. Each of these trial characteristics promote lower clinical expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Crinetics’ candidates are oral nonpeptide therapeutics that target peptide G protein-coupled receptors, which play a central role in the regulation of growth, energy, metabolism, GI function, stress, and nearly all aspects of homeostasis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Palsonify</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s commercial product is Palsonify (paltusotine), a once-daily small molecule somatostatin receptor type 2 (SST2) agonist that was approved by the FDA for the treatment of acromegaly when surgical response is inadequate or surgery is not an option on September 25, 2025. The green light was granted on the strength of two Phase 3 clinical trials. In PATHFNDER-1, 83% of acromegaly patients whose condition was controlled on peptide somatostatin mimickers octreotide or lanreotide depot monotherapy maintained insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels ≤ 1.0 times the upper limit of normal versus placebo (4%) (p&lt;0.0001). In PATHFNDR-2, the therapy achieved IGF-1 levels ≤ 1.0 times the upper limit of normal in 56% of treatment-naïve participants versus 5% for placebo (p&lt;0.0001).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/5.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1758850349\" alt=\"Acromegaly Symptoms Take a Toll on Patients\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/5.jpg?io=w1536&amp;ts=1758850349 1536w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/5.jpg?io=w1280&amp;ts=1758850349 1280w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/5.jpg?io=w1080&amp;ts=1758850349 1080w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/5.jpg?io=w750&amp;ts=1758850349 750w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/5.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1758850349 640w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/5.jpg?io=w480&amp;ts=1758850349 480w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/5.jpg?io=w320&amp;ts=1758850349 320w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/5.jpg?io=w240&amp;ts=1758850349 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>September 2026 Company Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In both studies, Palsonify maintained or lowered seven key symptoms of acromegaly, which is typically triggered by a benign pituitary tumor causing excess growth hormone [GH] discharge, resulting in the over secretion of IGF-1 by the liver. Since both GH and IGF-1 promote tissue development, their overproduction results in giantism-like abnormal growth of hands and feet and changes in facial features. In addition to these outward physical manifestations, acromegaly can cause arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, changes in glucose and lipid metabolism, fatigue, organ enlargement, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, skin odor, vision issues, and hypopituitarism. These symptoms contribute to increased mortality rates and lower quality of life.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/18.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1758850349\" alt=\"Acromegaly Patient Reach\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/18.jpg?io=w1536&amp;ts=1758850349 1536w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/18.jpg?io=w1280&amp;ts=1758850349 1280w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/18.jpg?io=w1080&amp;ts=1758850349 1080w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/18.jpg?io=w750&amp;ts=1758850349 750w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/18.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1758850349 640w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/18.jpg?io=w480&amp;ts=1758850349 480w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/18.jpg?io=w320&amp;ts=1758850349 320w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/18.jpg?io=w240&amp;ts=1758850349 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>September 2026 Company Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The first treatment option for the ~36,000 Americans suffering with acromegaly (of which ~17,000 are undiagnosed) is surgery, which can be curative if the tumor is accessible for complete resection. If surgery is unsuccessful, pharmacological options include first-line generic somatostatin analogs, including the aforementioned octreotide and lanreotide. However, the efficacy of these once-monthly, physician-administered (intramuscular or deep subcutaneous) peptide injections is spotty, with approximately half of the ~4,000 patients on these therapies failing to achieve biochemical control or experiencing a return of symptoms by month’s end. Pfizer’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>) Somavert (pegvisomant), a daily injectable GH receptor antagonist, is generally prescribed when these peptide therapies fail. An oral version of octreotide – Chiesi Farmaceutici’s twice-daily Mycappsa – was approved by the FDA in 2020 after 58% maintained their IGF-1 response versus 19% on placebo (p=0.008). However, its administration requires two fasting periods per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With clear superiority to Mycappsa and a significantly greater delivery advantage over the peptide and GH injections, Palsonify should rapidly become the go to treatment option in an admittedly crowded space when surgery is inadequate. Management believes that in addition to the ~1,500 newly diagnosed domestic patients per annum, there are currently ~11,000 diagnosed patients with high unmet need. An awareness program targeting the ~17,000 undiagnosed sufferers is part of an October 2025 launch, supported by a sales force of 36 and an annual price of $290,000. The EMA is expected to render a decision on its use across the pond in 1H26. News of the FDA sanctioning shot shares of CRNX 28% higher to $45.91 in the subsequent trading session.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other indication being pursued by Crinetics’ approved therapy is carcinoid syndrome, an excessive secretion of serotonin that causes severe diarrhea and flushing that afflicts ~33,000 Americans. Caused by neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), the disorder, like acromegaly, is typically treated with injectable peptide somatostatin analogs. That said, in 2018, Novartis’ (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVS\" title=\"Novartis AG\">NVS</a>) Lutathera (lutetium Lu 177 dotatate), a radioligand (i.e., a drug that combines a therapeutic molecule with a radioactive particle) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of gastro-entero-pancreatic NETs after demonstrating a 79% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death versus standard of care in patients with unresectable NETs in the midgut region. Despite being administered through four IV injections over eight weeks and intramuscular injections every four weeks for 18 months, owing to the fact that its addressable domestic market is ~110,000 (out of a total NET population of ~175,000), Lutathera sales reached $724 million in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After reducing flushing frequency by 63% (n=24; p&lt;0.0001) and excess bowl movements by 60% (n=16; p=0.02) in a Phase 2 trial, Palsonify is expected to enroll its first participant in a 141-patient, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study (CAREFNDR) with the prior study datapoints comprising the primary and key secondary endpoints (respectively) in 2H25.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Atumelnant</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Crinetics other clinical asset is atumelnant, an oral nonpeptide adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) receptor agonist that is being investigated for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia [CAH] and ACTH-dependent Cushing’s Syndrome (ADCS). CAH is a set of genetic maladies resulting from poor cortisol synthesis, which engenders over secretion of ACTH with multiple downstream effects such as overproduction of testosterone, leading to excessive facial hair, abnormal menstrual cycles, acne, and/or life-threatening salt and fluid imbalances. The conditions afflicts ~27,000 Americans, of which ~17,000 would likely be eligible for atumelnant. ADCS is the result of an overactive pituitary gland or ectopic (i.e., outside the pituitary) tumors that produce excessive levels of ACTH. With an estimated domestic prevalence of 11,000, Crinetics believes that ~5,000 would be eligible for atumelnant treatment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After demonstrating dose-dependent and statistically significant declines in morning serum androstenedione (A4) levels at week 12, atumelnant is set to be tested in three pivotal trials, including a Phase 2/3 study (BALANCE-CAH) in children and a Phase 3 trial (CALM-CAH) in adults – both with CAH – that should initiate in 2H25. A Phase 2/3 study for ADCS is expected to start in 1H26.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It should be noted that after seven decades without a new treatment option, <strong>Neurocrine Biosciences (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NBIX\" title=\"Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\">NBIX</a>)</strong> twice-daily, oral corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptor antagonist Crenessity (crinecerfont) won an approval from the FDA as an-add on to classic glucocorticoid replacement therapy for CAH in December 2024.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Balance Sheet &amp; Analyst Commentary:</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To finance its clinical and commercial ambitions, Crinetics held cash and securities of $1.20 billion on June 30, 2025, providing it an operating runway into 2029.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"817\" data-height=\"768\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CRNX Price Targets\" width=\"640\" height=\"602\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CRNX Price Targets <span>(TipRanks)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Street is enamored by Crinetics’ prospects, as can be seen above. On average, sell-side analysts <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRNX/earnings/estimates\"><strong>expect</strong></a> Palsonify to achieve blockbuster status by 2029 with sales of $1.19 billion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Verdict:</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sporting a market cap of ~$2.8 billion net of current cash and sales projections of ~$1.2 billion in FY29, shares of CRNX would appear to have additional upside. That said, the market for acromegaly right now is not huge. Given that it is already a crowded treatment market, Palsonify is Crinetics’ first commercial rodeo, pivotal trials for other indications (carcinoid, adult CAH, pediatric CAH, and Cushing’s) are only set to initiate over the ensuing 12 months, and Crenessity’s head start in CAH, analysts’ FY29 mean outlook appears optimistic. As such, I expect a pullback after the recent runup on Palsonify’s approval. If CRNX comes back down to the mid-$30s, I will likely take an initial position in the stock via <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>covered call</strong></a> orders. In the meantime, I will wait to see a couple of quarters of sales results to ascertain how the early stage marketing rollout is going for its newly approved treatment.</p>",

At the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4815267-futu-holdings-limited-futu-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4815267-futu-holdings-limited-futu-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">analyst briefing</a>, it explained that a rise in \"cash positions within their (clients') portfolios\" more than offset \"meaningful HIBOR declines.\" Its interest income outlook has become brighter now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Separately, its operations related to digital assets probably had a good performance in the latest quarter. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/hashkey-exchange\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/hashkey-exchange\" target=\"_blank\">CoinGecko's</a> data suggests that the \"<span>a</span>verage daily volume\" or \"ADV\" for \"HashKey\" grew three-fifths higher QoQ for 3Q25. The latter is an exchange used by FUTU to provide \"cryptocurrency trading\" according to a \"South China Morning Post\" <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3272822/online-brokerage-futu-offers-crypto-trading-hong-kong-nvidia-alibaba-stock-reward\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3272822/online-brokerage-futu-offers-crypto-trading-hong-kong-nvidia-alibaba-stock-reward\" target=\"_blank\">commentary piece</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm predicting that the enterprise will announce a doubling of non-GAAP earnings from 3Q24's HK$1,398<span> million</span> to 3Q2025's HK$2.8<span> billion</span> next month. This also translates into a 5% improvement sequentially.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">But Policy-Related Changes Are An Issue</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The regulatory authorities' actions can have a big impact on companies operating in the financial sector like FUTU.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recent news flow has gotten me worried about the group's prospects for the final quarter of '25 and the following year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FUTU's crypto-focused expansion initiatives might have taken a setback.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Barclays (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BCS\" title=\"Barclays PLC\">BCS</a>) issued a note (not publicly available) titled \"Seeking A Path To Riches\" on July 17, 2025. The bank's research indicated that FUTU is \"one of the leading applicants\" for \"licenses to issue stablecoins in HK.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company was asked about the \"crypto (stablecoin) exchange license in Hong Kong\" at its Q2 earnings call. It responded by saying that it is \"in the Phase 2 of the VATP (Virtual Asset Trading Platform) license application in Hong Kong\" and \"doing the feasibility studies for more license applications in other markets.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think it is reasonable to infer that FUTU is actively exploring stablecoin-related opportunities, which could broaden its revenue base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But \"Financial Times\" <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8bc1fcfa-8c69-4de0-b6cb-ab6f7117558b\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8bc1fcfa-8c69-4de0-b6cb-ab6f7117558b\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> on Oct. 19 \"PBoC (People’s Bank of China) officials advised against participating in the initial stablecoin rollout over concerns about allowing tech groups and brokerages to issue any type of currency.\" The same write-up also mentioned that \"Chinese tech giants have paused plans to issue stablecoins in Hong Kong, after Beijing raised concerns.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's highly possible that the implementation of new stablecoin legislation in HK is delayed. This takes into account the Chinese policymakers' unfavorable stance regarding crypto.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My view is that FUTU's long-term growth ceiling has become lower with the regulatory developments of late. Any stablecoin-related valuation premium is also no longer justified for the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, the firm's AUM growth could be hurt by China's greater scrutiny of taxation pertaining to overseas investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Legal firm \"Morgan Lewis\" highlighted in an Oct. 24 <a href=\"https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2025/10/chinas-new-tax-reporting-rules-are-a-game-changer-for-overseas-internet-platforms\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2025/10/chinas-new-tax-reporting-rules-are-a-game-changer-for-overseas-internet-platforms\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> that \"the Chinese government has introduced a set of new regulations requiring internet platforms to report tax-related information.\" \"Platforms providing services\" like \"brokerage\" are among those affected by the updated rules.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mainland Chinese have been keen on participating in the Hong Kong stock market. A major reason is because the city doesn't impose any levies on capital gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My thoughts are that the PRC's onshore investors might decide to turn their attention back to domestic equities listed in Shanghai/Shenzhen. FUTU's HK-listed financial products may be less popular going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The consensus is already projecting that the company's EPS growth goes from +67% in 2025 to +15% for 2026 based on S&amp;P Capital IQ data. The actual slowdown might be more severe with these adverse policy shifts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">My Closing Remarks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FUTU remains a hold-rated name. Its next 12 months' P/E is 18.3x (source: S&amp;P Capital IQ).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The average forward earnings multiple for FUTU's peers UP Fintech (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TIGR\" title=\"UP Fintech Holding Limited\">TIGR</a>) and Interactive Brokers (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBKR\" title=\"Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.\">IBKR</a>) is 21x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock's upside is +15% (21/18.3) pegged to its listed comparables. I require a capital appreciation of at least 20% to warrant a \"Buy.\" It doesn't meet this criterion.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FUTU doesn't have clear-cut re-rating drivers. The potential Q3 beat is negated by policy-related headwinds.</p>",

Looking at the longer term, we see $1.9 billion in acquisitions over the past 6 years compared to over $1.3 billion sold over the past 5 years, which is definitely a massive amount considering the company's size, although falling occupancy rates probably offset this for now, making a potential recovery even better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One such move is the recent acquisition of the Legacy Union Parking Garage at 720 South Church Street in Charlotte <a href=\"https://s23.q4cdn.com/319093197/files/doc_news/Highwoods-Acquires-Legacy-Union-Parking-Garage-at-720-South-Church-Street-in-Charlotte-2025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">for a $111.5 million total investment</a>, supporting their owned Legacy Union office, whose customers represent ~70% of the annual revenue, leased on a long-term basis with a remaining contractual term of 9 years.

Naturally, these have very significant effects, especially on REITs, being great for them in several ways. The effects of rate hikes/cuts are ultimately the reason behind the central bank’s decisions, made in an effort to steer the economy and fight inflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, I know this may seem like common knowledge for most of you, but I’m surprised by how many people I’ve seen (especially in recent months) that call REITs bad because they underperformed in recent years as rates were hiked. I like REITs as an asset class and I believe they can serve essential roles in many portfolios, so it’s a shame for someone to pass on these ideas thinking they’re bad just because they performed as they should in a high-rate environment. This is ultimately what this asset class is supposed to do because the business model is almost all about interest rates, basically playing with the spread between their cost of debt and return on their leases/investments—the difference being what they give back to us as shareholders, a bit of capital for investing/other uses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, not only do they reduce the interest expenses on the company’s debt (HIW’s interest expenses got to a record of ~$150 million TTM), having a direct impact on the company’s AFFO and other metrics, but they can also help the tenants in similar ways, providing improved financial flexibility in a time when many businesses need it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, the market’s seems quite pessimistic around the US economy, although we’ve seen some improvements lately with Trump’s sanctions on Russia, India and China’s halt of Russian oil acquisitions, etc., but that’s more about global trade and we’re still looking at what is so far the second-largest government shutdown, huge levels of debt, renewed trade war fears, and more risks that can stem from these factors. For example, I see that the market is also worried that the <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/story/2025/10/28/shutdown-means-less-data-for-fed-interest-rate-decision\" rel=\"nofollow\">shutdowns can result in less data for the Fed</a> to base its interest rate decisions on, which can lead to an uncertain position as Powell may be inclined to go for a more careful approach, potentially affecting the expectations for 2 more rate cuts this year. And that’s on top of the significant political uncertainty felt in this environment, potentially leading to a bad or even worse scenario for this asset class.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1461\" data-height=\"829\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Highwoods Properties IR HIW stock analysis seekingalpha valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"363\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Highwoods Properties IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This macro pressure is also felt in the company’s operations, with some of the lowest occupancy rates in recent history.

I’ll assume a WACC of 7.5% (above my estimated ~7.21% based on a cost of equity of ~9% and 5.5% cost of debt), with $3.44 billion worth of net debt plus preferred on 110.52 million shares outstanding as of the Q3 report. This way, we get to an enterprise value of $8.19 billion, meaning an equity value of $4.75 billion, for a price of $42.98, basically getting us to the levels from before the rate hikes and industry’s slump began.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusions</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I rate HIW a Buy given their quality, good margin of safety, and solid performance despite the industry’s headwinds, while also providing a good dividend. Risk remains especially in this environment, but the company’s solid fundamentals and attractive price should offset it once rate cuts advance and the economy recovers.</p>",

After several months of increasing headline inflation, the just-released inflation data points to a trend reversal. Headline inflation, according to the national measure, decreased to 2.3% year-on-year in October, from 2.4% YoY in<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> September. The European measure also came down to 2.3% YoY. Core inflation remained unchanged at 2.8% YoY, while services inflation even increased somewhat to 3.5% YoY, from 3.4% YoY.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Moving towards 2%</span></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The available regional state data shows that the drop in German inflation was mainly driven by favourable base effects. On the month, almost all categories saw prices slightly increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, the stronger euro and still-favourable energy base effects should push German inflation back towards - and below - 2% over the coming months. At the same time, the worsening labour market and AI will further moderate wage growth. Finally, US tariffs could also bring disinflationary pressures to Europe due to overcapacity and weaker sales in the US. While these elements clearly bring disinflationary forces to Germany over the coming months, the longer-term picture brings more upward pressure on inflation. Restructuring of supply chains, labour costs in an era of ageing and the green transition remain three important structural drivers of price pressures. And not to forget, the inflationary impact from Germany’s fiscal stimulus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, today’s inflation reading marks another turning point and the start of at least a short-lived period of rather disinflationary pressures before inflationary forces take over again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

EM stocks rallied and broadly outperformed developed markets as trade tensions generally subsided, the euphoria around artificial intelligence ('AI') persisted and expectations rose for more interest rate cuts<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> from the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chinese markets outperformed much of the globe. China posted some of the strongest returns, marking three straight months of outpacing its EM peers. Easing trade tensions with the U.S., policy support for chipmakers and accelerating spending on AI drove gains amid hopes that the government's policy to combat price wars and disinflation will help the Chinese economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Information technology stocks drove quarterly outperformance. The sector was home to three top contributors, including Zhongji Innolight, electronics manufacturing company Delta Electronics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DLEGF\" title=\"Delta Electronics (Thailand) Public Company Limited\">OTCPK:DLEGF</a>) and chip designer company Montage Technology. We believe Delta rallied amid positive earnings surprises, strong performance in electric vehicles and data centers, and growth expectations around global electrification trends and AI infrastructure expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financials was an area of relative strength. Stocks we did not hold helped power gains in the sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positioning in materials hindered relative performance. Lack of exposure to many sector names that we did not own was a key driver to underperformance, along with an underweight to South Africa-based mining group Gold Fields (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GFI\" title=\"Gold Fields Limited\">GFI</a>) relative to the benchmark.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Contributors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zhongji Innolight. We believe a strong earnings report and artificial intelligence (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AI\" title=\"C3.ai, Inc.\">AI</a>)-driven demand supported the stock. Zhongji Innolight is a key supplier of high-end optical transceivers for AI data centers and 5G networks, a focus of global AI capital spending cycles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Delta Electronics. Positive earnings surprises and strong performance in electric vehicles and data centers lifted shares. The company raised earnings forecasts, reflecting confidence in its growth trajectory. We believe Delta, a key supplier of AI power, is benefiting from global electrification trends and AI infrastructure expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Montage Technology. The company reported surging revenue and net profit growth, and our research indicated that it has continued to enlarge its presence in the scale-up networking market, while maintaining stable growth in its interface integrated circuit business.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Detractors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Xiaomi. We believe the stock was weak amid competition in the smartphone space, a seasonal slowdown in the Internet of Things segment and rising costs, as higher-than-expected operating expenses weighed on earnings. Our research also indicated that a slower-than-expected new factory ramp-up drove lower volume forecasts for electric vehicles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ICICI Bank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBN\" title=\"ICICI Bank Limited\">IBN</a>). The stock underperformed due to what we believed was a mix of margin pressure, rising gross nonperforming assets and concerns about consumer credit demand and asset quality. Net interest margin declined, and management warned that margins may fall further if interest rates fall. Deposit growth was also weaker than anticipated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alibaba (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA\" title=\"Alibaba Group Holding Limited\">BABA</a>) Group Holding. An underweight to the China-based e-commerce giant relative to the benchmark weighed on returns as the stock advanced during the period.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notable Trades</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HKXCF\" title=\"Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\">OTCPK:HKXCF</a>). The securities and derivatives exchange is the key conduit of capital flows to and from mainland China. With policy support for capital markets activity and area economies driving flow activity, we believe increased initial public offering activity and the Stock Connect program reforms will likely support the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Montage Technology. The company is a fabless firm mainly engaged in designing and selling memory interface chips, with end markets focused on servers and data centers. We believe solid growth in memory interface chips and a fast ramp-up of new products have helped create a more promising growth outlook for Montage Technology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China State Construction International Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCOHF\" title=\"China State Construction International Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:CCOHF</a>). We exited CSCI amid what we believed were ongoing challenges in China's construction and infrastructure space, including slower project approvals and continuing weakness in the real estate market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BYD (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BYDDF\" title=\"BYD Company Limited\">OTCPK:BYDDF</a>). We exited BYD amid what we believed were weaker-than-expected earnings, slowing domestic demand and intensifying competition in China's electric vehicle market. BYD missed consensus profit estimates and cut its 2025 sales target as government pressure to end aggressive price wars, which had helped fuel BYD's rapid growth, weighed on the company.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio Positioning</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The portfolio continues to invest in companies where we believe financials are strong and improving but share price performance does not fully reflect these factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our outlook remains constructive. In our view, emerging markets (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EM\" title=\"Smart Share Global Limited\">EM</a>) equities have been supported by strong company performance, stabilizing U.S. trade policy and anticipated interest rate cuts from the U.S. Fed. We believe the growth gap between EM and developed markets (DM) will remain robust, with EM economies' growth rates expected to improve in 2026, while the U.S. and some other DM are projected to weaken.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EM valuations, earnings growth potential provide separation. We believe EM companies typically offer more attractive valuations and the prospect of higher earnings growth than many global DM peers. Given the often strong inverse relationship between EM equities and the dollar, we think a weaker U.S. dollar could also function as a growth driver for EM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Government policy efforts a key in China. The summer tariff pause between the U.S. and China has helped improve market sentiment toward China. We think that while domestic economic growth may moderate in the short term, the Chinese government's targeted approach to increasing domestic demand will likely support profitability, while easing deflation and oversupply. We believe that if the government is successful, demand improvement could be sizable and would likely reverberate across other emerging markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EM companies are central to global technology and artificial intelligence (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AI\" title=\"C3.ai, Inc.\">AI</a>) supply chains. Our research has indicated that while high tariff rates may provide headwinds in markets such as India and Brazil, South Korea, China and Taiwan are among the nations that have benefited from rapidly increasing investment in AI and AI-driven sentiment, pushing equities to all-time highs in many markets. During the quarter, many of the world's largest tech firms—hyperscalers including Alphabet ((GOOG) (GOOGL)), Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) and Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>)—revealed plans to increase their capital expenditures, affirming their commitment to AI-related spending despite some investor concerns that they might dial things back, especially in early 2025.</p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Goal and Strategy:</strong> Long-term capital growth by investing primarily in emerging market companies of all sizes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Portfolio Management Team</strong></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Name</th> <th>Start Date</th> <th></th> </tr> <tr> <th></th> <th>Industry</th> <th>Company</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Patricia Ribeiro</td> <td>1984</td> <td>2006</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sherwin Soo, CFA</td> <td>1995</td> <td>2011</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Top 10 Holdings (%)</strong></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody> <tr> <td>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>)</td> <td>11.09</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tencent Holdings Ltd (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCEHY\" title=\"Tencent Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:TCEHY</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCTZF\" title=\"Tencent Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:TCTZF</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCEHY\" title=\"Tencent Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:TCEHY</a>)</td> <td>7.54</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Alibaba Group Holding Ltd</td> <td>4.18</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Samsung Electronics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\">OTCPK:SSNLF</a>) Co Ltd</td> <td>3.74</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Xiaomi Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XIACF\" title=\"Xiaomi Corporation\">OTCPK:XIACF</a>)</td> <td>2.37</td> </tr> <tr> <td>SK Hynix Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HXSCF\" title=\"SK hynix Inc.\">OTCPK:HXSCF</a>)</td> <td>2.15</td> </tr> <tr> <td>NetEase (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTES\" title=\"NetEase, Inc.\">NTES</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NETTF\" title=\"NetEase, Inc.\">OTCPK:NETTF</a>) Inc</td> <td>2.07</td> </tr> <tr> <td>ICICI Bank Ltd</td> <td>2.07</td> </tr> <tr> <td>HDFC Bank Ltd (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HDB\" title=\"HDFC Bank Limited\">HDB</a>)</td> <td>2.02</td> </tr> <tr> <td>China Construction Bank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CICHY\" title=\"China Construction Bank Corporation\">OTCPK:CICHY</a>) Corp</td> <td>2.01</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td>As of 9/30/2025<em>The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security.

Q3 2025 results gave<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> even more conviction that my investment thesis for VLTO would play out. With a robust demand outlook for the WQ segment and the product innovation strategy supporting the PIQ segment, I expect growth to eventually accelerate, and that would drive up multiples.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong Q3 2025 results support the bull thesis.</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VLTO delivered another solid quarter in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20283295-veralto-reports-third-quarter-2025-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A1\">Q3 2025</a>, reinforcing my bullish view on this company. Total sales grew 6.9% y/y to $1.404 billion, with core sales up 5.1% (this is the fifth straight quarter of mid-single-digit growth). Both volume and pricing contributed positively for all segments. Water Quality [WQ] saw revenue up 7% y/y to $856 million and core growth of 5.3%, led by North America (6% y/y) and high-growth markets (7.1% y/y). EBIT margin for WQ expanded 150 bps y/y to 26.3%. As for Product Quality &amp; Innovation [PQI], revenue grew 6.9% y/y to $548 million (core growth was 4.6%), driven by North America (9.2%) and 330 bps of price contribution to offset tariffs. While the PQI margin dipped to 25.4%, it was mainly due to acquisitions and tariff mitigation, not structural factors. Adj. EPS grew 11% y/y to $0.99, beating the high end of guidance by $0.04, and management raised FY25 adj. EPS guidance to $3.82–$3.85 (from $3.72–$3.80). Overall, the quarter was good.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The WQ segment continues to ride powerful secular waves.</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have become more confident about the WQ segment performance after looking at the developments so far. Core sales accelerated sequentially to 5.3% y/y growth, and notably, this momentum was broad-based, supported by both water treatment and water analytics. But perhaps the more important takeaway was the clearer link between VLTO growth and the global AI infrastructure investment theme.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The semiconductor angle I discussed earlier this year is clearly playing out, but the first distinction today is that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834673-veralto-corporation-vlto-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">management has explicitly called</a> out the opportunity tied directly to data centers (which is really driven largely by the major cloud and hyperscale players) as well as related sub-segments like power generation. As a recap, the basic idea here is that these facilities require substantial volumes of water for cooling, and this plays right up into VLTO’s strength. Operators need to rely on VLTO to help maintain uptime while at the same time reduce both water and energy consumption. You could, in fact, see VLTO’s water solution as mission critical because without it, the entire data center will not work well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We have very high visibility to the demand outlook here as well, which makes the equity story even more attractive. The latest earnings from hyperscalers such as <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835092-microsoft-corporation-msft-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">Microsoft</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835072-alphabet-inc-googl-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Alphabet</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) show us just how massive this AI infrastructure build-out has become. Take MSFT, for instance; its commercial remaining purchase obligation [RPO] grew &gt;50% y/y to ~$400 billion, with an incremental $250 billion Azure commitment from OpenAI alone. The more impressive data point is that MSFT expects to increase AI capacity by &gt;80% in FY25 and roughly double their data center footprint within two years. This implies a significant acceleration in data center investments. A similar picture is painted by GOOGL, which saw its Google Cloud backlog grow 46% sequentially to $155 billion, which is also driven primarily by AI-related workloads. Both companies even came out explicitly saying that they will remain capacity-constrained well into next year as demand continues to outpace supply.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, this is not a case of whether data center investments will come through, but one that is going to happen.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">PQI Is Executing Well</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As expected, the PQI segment got impacted by tariff impacts, and like I noted in my February write-up, navigating the tariff environment would be a key test for VLTO. Encouragingly, Q3’s results confirm VLTO is managing it well. Contrary to my belief that VLTO will lose pricing power, it actually managed to push pricing upwards, which contributed 330 bps to core growth. This shows that the adjustments made earlier this year have helped VLTO to fully offset tariff costs going forward. The key line item here, I think, is volume growth. VLTO actually managed to push pricing upwards with volume growing (volume up 1.3% y/y), which suggests a very healthy end-market demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A big part of this pricing power comes from VLTO’s product innovation strategy, of which the highlight of this quarter was Videojet, which saw strong adoption for the refreshed Continuous Ink Jet [CIJ] and laser printer lineup. I expect adoption to remain strong here, giving VLTO pricing power, as the new UV laser marking system is just a way better product that replaces older technologies. There are two key upgrades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, it provides an alternative to thermal transfer overlay [TTO] systems (this is the widely used legacy method). The difference lies in the marking process itself. TTO uses a heated print head to press ink from a ribbon onto the film, requiring direct contact and ongoing consumable ribbons. But for VLTO's new UV laser technology, it uses precise chemical change directly on the film surface using a light beam, which creates a permanent mark without contact, heat, or consumables. The result is not only better reliability (fewer chemical reactions needed) but also lower long-term operating costs (less heat and fewer consumables used).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, and perhaps more importantly in today’s market, the UV laser helps customers transition to more sustainable flexible film packaging. With the UV laser technology, customers will produce way less ribbon waste and at the same time also be able to use thinner films (lesser materials used vs. thicker films that are needed to withstand heat from TTO technology). This effectively allows CPG companies to work towards their ESG goals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, I’d say that while PQI’s margins remain temporarily affected by tariff mitigation and ongoing growth investments, the overall results were positive. As we roll into next year, PQI will face an easy comp as it continues to enjoy pricing power, supported by the new product innovation strategy.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FCF and balance sheet</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I also think it's worth putting attention on VLTO’s free cash flow [FCF] and balance sheet situation. In Q3, VLTO generated $258 million in FCF, which was up 20% y/y, pushing year-to-date FCF to &gt;$700 million. This is a very comforting performance because it means that VLTO can continue to invest aggressively in its R&amp;D without worrying about liquidity issues. This adds strength to the balance sheet, which existed in Q3 with ~$1.8 billion in cash and net leverage at just 0.7x. With this leverage ratio, VLTO has the choice to take on debt to ramp up investments or acquire strategically. On the latter, management did note in the call that M&amp;A remains the top capital allocation priority, and they are seeing an active pipeline of targets across both WQ and PQI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I believe the fundamentals remain strong, and VLTO has a strong balance sheet to support this growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With my views unchanged for VLTO’s fundamentals (which, in fact, have gotten better), I think the valuation de-rating seen so far has been unwarranted. VLTO is now trading at just 17x forward EBITDA, a discount from its average of ~19x. The market seems to be penalizing VLTO for the softer Q4 core growth guidance (low single-digit percentage), which I think is unfair given that Q4 has three fewer shipping days. Adjusting for those, growth would’ve been mid-single-digits. Also, the large data center demand opportunity has yet to be realized in VLTO’s books. As the big boys like MSFT and GOOGL ramp up spending, we should see growth acceleration for VLTO WQ’s segment. At the current 17x, I think the market is not pricing in any growth acceleration at all, and as I said before, once VLTO shows that, multiples should re-rate upwards easily. I would think a re-rate to 19x (the average) is a very possible range in the next couple of quarters.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The ongoing volatility in trade policies and tariffs are key uncertainties. While current mitigation actions (such as targeted pricing and supply chain adjustments) have worked, there is no guarantee that further policy shifts would not happen. Should they happen and the impacts be worse, VLTO will be impacted. VLTO is also investing heavily in growth initiatives, which carry some form of execution risk. Any delays or inefficiencies in these projects could temporarily weigh on margins.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My view for VLTO remains a buy rating. The fundamentals here continue to strengthen, with visible demand drivers, solid execution, and a balance sheet that provides flexibility. I believe the current valuation at ~17x forward EBITDA is an attractive entry point, especially ahead of potential growth acceleration from AI-related infrastructure opportunities.</p>",
