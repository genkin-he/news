Correlations are breaking down, political and fiscal paths<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> are diverging, and yield curves are telling different stories across regions. At the same time, investors are grappling with a familiar constraint. Spreads are tight, so where can you still find attractive income, diversification, and flexibility without making a dramatic sell the US call?</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My name is Anu Rajakumar, and today I'm joined by Paul Grainger, Senior Portfolio Manager on the Global Fixed Income team. Paul, welcome to the show.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> Thank you for having me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Paul, let's start with some of the macro backdrop. For a while, especially during COVID and right after, it felt like everyone around the world was living through the same shocks, supply chains, the reopening surge. We saw policymakers around the world responding fairly similarly with big fiscal spending and then aggressive rate hikes, et cetera.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fast forward to today, and policy paths look less uniform, and markets are starting to diverge. Why should investors pay attention to these shifts and the correlations that are starting to break down? What's driving it, and how does that create opportunity for investors?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> I think the key point is what you've highlighted. There are opportunities for investors even in the current environment. I think the last three years generally rewarded a pretty straightforward approach to managing fixed income assets. You own duration to benefit from rates coming down. You own credit to benefit from the improved credit quality, but also the support to the economy from rates coming down. With hindsight, which is a wonderful thing, that was quite an easy trade to do. The question as we look forward is, where do we go from this when policy rates are closer to neutral?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They may not be there, but we're definitely closer. Credit spreads are tight. The macro and political risks are more varied across regions than they've been for some time. There is still income to be had from the market, but there's still the risk of volatility. The question really is, how do we deal with that? Part of it comes from what you said that the correlations are breaking down. Correlations breaking down is not necessarily a bad thing. It actually provides opportunities to allocate capital between different regions, between different sectors of the economy, between different parts of the yield curve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I do think that in the current environment, as part of a broader asset allocation, fixed income is really important as part of that diversification. The things that we'll be looking for as we go forward, for these correlations, but also the opportunities, are geopolitics. Just to be clear, this isn't just about the US and what's happening there. Obviously, we read a lot about US politics, but it's also what's happening in different parts of the world. We've clearly got different political dynamics happening in different countries in Europe. We've got an election coming up in Japan, although that will be done by the time many of the listeners listen to this podcast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We've also got a lot of tensions in the UK, where I sit, with risks around the government and challenges potentially to the leadership of the ruling Labor Party. All these things on geopolitics, coupled with different growth rates, different inflation paths, and these varying fiscal constraints, mean that the ability of bond markets and economies to move in sync is going to be challenged as we go forward. That is actually to us really interesting and also to our clients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Excellent. Now, you've mentioned a few different areas and regions. Europe is not just one homogeneous block either. It's lots of individual countries. Tell us more about why that's important for folks to really consider.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> I think actually that's a really important factor for investors, particularly for those investors who haven't historically invested in Europe. It's been quite easy for people in the past to look at Europe as one place and to say, Europe's doing well; Europe's doing badly. Those relationships really broke down during the Eurozone crisis, and actually, they've flipped on their head since then. During the Eurozone crisis, I'm sure everyone remembers, it was all about the periphery: Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece struggling. They were really seen as the poor links, the poor relations in Europe, the bond markets you didn't want to own.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">France and Germany were seen as the core stable markets where you wanted to allocate capital. That's really been turned on its head in the past few years, and it's been turned on its head for a couple of reasons. One is those periphery countries took their medicine. They went through some of the pain of having to tighten their fiscal budgetary positions. They've been through political changes. Some of them have more political stability than they have had in the past. At the same time, places like France have struggled to get its budget through in the past year, and there is more political uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The political dynamics have shifted. To put it in context, in 2022, Italian bond yields were around 2% higher than French bond yields. That yield spread now is the same. Italian and French bond yields in the 10-Year maturity are trading at the same yield level. Now, part of that is due to this changing, shifting political dynamics. Part of it clearly is due to the fact that investors have chased yield and wanted to move down the credit spectrum. That's been underpinned by improving fundamentals. To give a bit of an insight into Italy and what's happening there in domestic politics, Giorgia Meloni has now been in power for more than three years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This may not sound like a long time for many investors on the call or many people listening. To put it in historical perspective, and I think these numbers are right, but I'm sure someone will fact-check and tell me if I'm wrong, I think there've been 31 prime ministers in Italy in the last 80 years, with only 6 of those serving more than 3 years. It's a big shift to actually have someone who's getting policy done, but also getting policy done when having been prudent and having gotten more credibility from the market. I think if people had said that five years ago, there would have been question marks around that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I guess where it leaves us is that, to your point that you raised, which is we have to look at Europe as a collection of countries, not a homogeneous block. As investors, that causes some challenges because the correlations are breaking down, but it also provide opportunity to allocate between those countries and not just think about allocating between the big blocks of US, Europe, and Asia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Yes, that's terrific. That role reversal of some of those countries in Europe is really quite astounding. Maybe just to continue on this theme, you mentioned this global phenomenon, and I just want to hear a little bit more. When you say global fixed income, how would you characterize the material differences between investing within the US bond market and investing globally? Also, just curious, what parts of the global market do you think people often overlook that actually can deliver that yield and diversification?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> I think if I had to sum it up in one word, it would be breadth. The breadth of the global bond market is far wider than the US bond market. It's not a negative on the US bond market. It's just the facts of where issuances come from governments around the world, from corporates around the world, and from the so-called supranational and sovereign and agency issues. Essentially, we have multiple currencies, more countries, and a wider set of issuer types. We have 76 countries in the global bond index. We've got 29 currencies. We're able to rotate capital around those.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More importantly, from a benchmark or a universe perspective for clients, what it means is you get some natural diversification. I guess it links to your earlier question about correlations. Post-COVID, correlations were really high. Markets, economies were moving in lockstep, particularly in the developed world. Even in developed markets now, we're starting to see divergence between those countries and those currencies. That gives a natural, almost hedge or natural cadence to these global portfolios, which means that you're not putting all your fixed income risk in one country and one currency related to one economy. That is really powerful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It should be noted as well that the global bond index does have some exposure to the so-called emerging markets, even though in this index, it is only investment grade. It's the higher-quality emerging markets there. Why is that important? It's important because for some time, they've taken a different path in terms of their economy, their monetary policy. They were earlier in raising rates than we were in the developed world. That means that we're now seeing a lot of opportunity come out in emerging markets. That, again, gives this natural diversification from being in global fixed income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One thing that I will highlight that I think is a bit different when we look at the global bond market than just the US market is this so-called supranational sovereign and agency paper. These are bonds that are issued by entities that are linked to governments. They are very high-quality, typically AAA or AA. They can actually be higher quality than the individual governments because of the cross-governmental guarantees that come through. They're a big part of the benchmark. They're 20% of the benchmark. We're fortunate that we can access that market in a liquid way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Yes. No, that's very fair. The last question, you talked about the breadth of the opportunities, potentially rotating capital across dozens of countries and currencies to find that income and diversification. Paul, I want to touch on the US dollar as well. Of course, it depreciated quite significantly in 2025. General consensus is that it'll continue to depreciate in 2026, perhaps not to the same magnitude. I'd love to hear about your views on that and how that affects the opportunity set.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> Clearly, the dollar depreciated quite materially. There are a lot of forces at work, geopolitics, but also the fact that the Federal Reserve was cutting interest rates. We continue to think, as we said, the Fed will cut interest rates as the market's pricing. There are risks to the downside with a new Fed chair. However, the dollar can still come under pressure, but that is not necessarily the reason to be in global fixed income and to diversify and have a broader opportunity set.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason for a broader opportunity set is because of the potential for returns from that opportunity set, irrespective of what the dollar does, but also the ability to diversify and the ability to tap into other markets. Just to be clear, this isn't a dollar trade. This isn't the sell the US and buy everything else. This is part of a natural allocation that should be there in portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> I think that's a really important differentiation. This is not just a currency play, right?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> Absolutely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Now, if we go region by region, I'd love to hear about where your team is seeing the most interesting relative value opportunities and what are some of the risks you're watching most closely, and further to that, any areas that you are actually avoiding at the moment?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> I think in relative value opportunities, we always have to bring it back to what's being priced in by the market. We're constructive on European fixed income, and part of that is that we see European growth disappointing. We see ability for the European Central Bank to cut interest rates further. Right now, the market is pricing no further interest rate cuts from the ECB. That is an opportunity to allocate capital at relatively attractive European yields but also benefit from what we think will be interest rate cuts. That contrasts slightly with the US, where, again, we see the scope for interest rate cuts, but the market is already pricing that to some extent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We're much more driven there by the trading range environment that we're in. You put those two together, and it means that we are looking to be within global portfolios, overweight Europe relative to the US. Another area that I think until a few years ago people weren't really focusing on was Japan. Japan had been a market that no one had invested in, really, as an overseas investor or an international investor for many decades. That changed two or three years ago. We think there's a really interesting opportunity in Japan. There is volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We do think that that market, which is pricing in, I think, three interest rate hikes now, is obviously looking at a very different place to other global bond markets. We don't think that we'll get three interest rate hikes. We think on that basis, there is value in the market already. The yield curve is relatively steep because of concerns about fiscal issuance and the ongoing funding of the government. We actually think that that will provide an opportunity</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't think there are areas that we're particularly negative or concerned about within fixed income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I would say is that within credit, credit spreads are tight. That comes down now to really focusing on where are the good quality companies, where are we going to be able to harvest some incremental income, some incremental returns, but also accept the fact that we will get bouts of volatility coming through there. We are relatively defensive, but do think there will be opportunities coming up</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Terrific. You laid up the next question yourself. Turning to credit. As you said, lots of questions are about tight spreads at the moment. Where are the good opportunities within credit? How are you approaching the area? What are the concerns that you have around credit?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> I think the first thing I'll say is that we spend a lot of our time, like other fixed-income investors, focusing on spreads. Actually, we should be clear that across the fixed income universe, all-in yields still look relatively attractive. We should be clear that corporate bonds still give you income, so they still have a place in people's portfolios. When we look at the relative spreads and the relative pricing between corporates and governments, clearly, we're at a narrow end of the range that we've been in for some time. Spreads are tight for a reason.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They're tight because we've had improved credit quality, the positive growth environment we've been in, the support that we've had from central banks with interest rates being cut, and also, like every asset, they're driven by supply and demand. We've seen a lot of demand for fixed income and a lot of demand for corporate bonds. We think that will continue as we go through the year because there is this demand for income, because income gives you the cushion to the rest of your portfolio. To think about the question of where are the opportunities, the opportunities we think now are going to be in relative sector calls, looking at different issuers that come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, we know there is issuance coming to the market, and we can harvest some of that new issue premium. Clearly, one of the things we've seen recently is that the AI-related names, credit spreads have widened. Now, clearly, that's something that has been happening, but looking forward, we do think there's going to be opportunity in those names as well. Timing is not necessarily today, but these relative repricings will provide opportunities for us to allocate capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We're also going to have to think carefully about where we allocate on the yield curve. Do we allocate to shorter-dated bonds or to bonds that are further out the curve? We're going to continue to see that. I think the key thing I would say is that in this environment, we're not in an environment where the rising tide of demand lifts all boats and all assets. So we're going to have to be much more nuanced about where we're allocating capital. We're going to have to really focus on research, in-depth analysis of the company, staying engaged, and being cognizant of the risks around us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Yes, no, and to your point, in an environment where we think there's going to be above-trend growth for 2026, fundamentals still look solid, that credit is something that can continue to stay on the table for most investors, I think. Paul, on implementation, if an investor wants global exposure but also wants to stay nimble, how would you suggest that they go about building that into a portfolio?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> That's a great question because I think everything we've talked about is -- the fixed income's attractive, but it's going to be more nuanced. There's going to be more volatility around that. I think that's actually the benefit of a global fixed income approach is that you can allocate capital relatively quickly between the sectors, between countries, and to different parts of the yield curve should opportunities arise. I think for us, that says have a broad approach. It says allow flexibility, but flexibility within bands or within bounds, we obviously have ranges that we will look to allocate to duration to curve to different countries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the key here is that we need to think about every part of the market separately and look at how they trade relative to each other and look at those opportunities. As I said before, we need to really understand that even in places like Europe, it's a collection of different countries. When we think about Asia, it's a collection of different countries, and there will be opportunities coming across there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that the key part here is this is a liquid market. This is public bonds. They're liquid. We can reallocate capital really quickly, and we can redeploy as opportunities arise. Really, why do we see this global universe as being a natural part of investors' asset allocation?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Excellent. Maybe just one final follow-up there. Tell us where emerging markets fit into this discussion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> As I alluded to before, I think emerging markets have been in a slightly different cycle to developed markets. One could say that emerging markets reacted to the inflation threat a lot earlier than developed markets. Now granted, their inflation basket is very different to developed markets, but they reacted earlier, they tightened policy earlier, and that means that they're in a slightly different place in the cycle. Emerging markets were also an asset class that saw, up until recently, net outflows. So there's not a lot of crowded positions there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We're certainly starting to see a lot of opportunity in emerging markets from the fundamental side, from valuations, and from technicals. We're also starting to see clients reallocate capital to emerging markets as they search for added income. I would say that the valuation metrics for emerging markets relative to credit right now are still attractive</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Excellent. Thank you very much for those comments. Paul, I can't let you go without a quick bonus question. Of course, the market environment is very volatile. So I'd like to know what you tend to do to help you reset and think clearly outside the office.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> That's a good question. I actually play quite a random, esoteric sport that many people on this podcast won't have heard of, called real tennis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Tell us more about real tennis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> Real tennis is essentially Henry VIII's version of tennis. One of the few similarities is it has a ball, it has a net, and it has a racket. The differences are it's an enclosed court. You can play off any wall. There are certain hazards there, or nets that you can hit, that you get bonus points that automatically win the point. You also play with a wooden racket that is not symmetrical.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would encourage anyone who's interested look it up online. It's completely random. The scoring is also relatively complicated as well. It is quite good to disconnect from work because you have to concentrate on trying to hit a ball that is hand-sewn, so it doesn't bounce the same way. The scoring is slightly random. I would say that it's -- you can either try and play the point or remember the score. It is something that...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar: </strong>You can't do both.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> You can't do both. It is something that requires a lot of concentration. It does mean that you switch off quite meaningfully from work.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar</strong>: I love that. Thank you so much for sharing that. It's a fun fact about yourself. Paul, this is a great discussion today. Maybe just to quickly summarize a few of the comments that you said. You mentioned that investors shouldn't abandon US assets and follow that sell the US trade. Our conversation was really about the marginal allocation decisions that really are starting to matter more as markets and policy paths diverge.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We talked about correlations that have come down, and the global fixed income opportunity set really looks more differentiated than it has in recent years. We talked about rotating capital and accessing dozens of countries and currencies to find income and diversification. You've talked about some of the views that the fixed income team has at the moment, at Neuberger, overweight Europe versus the US, where there could be potential mispricing from the ECB. You also highlighted Japan as an area that's attractive due to the valuation opportunity and the steep yield curve there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then, finally, hopefully, I'm summarizing this fairly, that in an environment of tight spreads, the combination of income diversification flexibility plus the ability to be nimble when those dislocations appear can be especially valuable for investors. Hopefully, I summarized that okay for you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> That's absolutely perfect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Excellent. Paul, once again, thank you so much for being on the show, and good luck in your next real tennis match.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger: </strong>Thank you very much. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This communication is provided for informational and educational purposes only and nothing herein constitutes investment, legal, accounting or tax advice, or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold a security.

However, a deeper look at its structure reveals a long term structural edge many of the more popular income alternatives miss - that is a strong drawdown protection layer.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The total returns suffer a bit because of the protective put layer, but it shifts the risk reward asymmetry favorably. KHPI may appear weak in strong rallies like we saw in 2025. But whenever markets consolidate, its aggressive covered call writing strategy ensures potential income even when positive trends are missing. Overall, I find KHPI as a strong income contender for long term investors (due to the protective put layer), and especially for a flatter 2026 market (due to a more aggressive covered call layer).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What the Protective Put Does</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A <a href=\"https://www.kensingtonassetmanagement.com/solutions/etfs-khpi/#performance\" rel=\"nofollow\">look at the KHPI portfolio</a> reveals how it is set up and also reveals a key differentiator that tilts the long term risk reward balance. As of February 25, 2026, the portfolio holds ~502k VOO shares. This is ~$315m at current VOO prices and close to KHPI's AUM. That is, the portfolio is fully deployed on the S&amp;P 500 with little surplus remaining to invest in treasuries or money market funds - something several peer S&amp;P 500 covered calls ETFs do, using synthetic option based exposure routes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The portfolio shows around 457 SPX put contracts. Since the S&amp;P 500 is at ~6900 now, each contract is worth ~$$690k (100 multiplier per contract). The notional coverage of this option spread layer is therefore ~$315m - almost exactly the size of the underlying holdings. This option layer is ~6% away from current spot levels and ensures that drawdowns beyond ~6% are capped, and since coverage is for the entire portfolio, this protection completely limits big drawdowns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This means if there is a crash by say 20%, KHPI limits its drawdown to only ~6%. However, if the S&amp;P 500 is down by only 4%, KHPI does not visibly show any material protective benefit. The hedge is for extreme events and often does not show its true value in most market scenarios, especially when the going is smooth like now (and in 2025). But from a risk reward balance perspective, it alters the profile of the income plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Most income focused covered call strategies generally prioritize income generation and upside capture, which means the protective put is missing and drawdown mitigation due to an option layer and premiums thereof are limited. That is if the S&amp;P 500 is down by 20%, you may very well see SPYI down by 17-18% - a lesser impact, but a fixed 2-3% protection. The open downside structure works out well in a long term bullish scenario, but the ride is often more volatile during rare crashes. By limiting crash possibilities, KHPI actually converts the total return charts into a lower return lower risk vehicle - not a bad outcome for income investors. The upside is limited because there is a cost of protection. While SPYI and GPIX often track the S&amp;P 500 with minimal drag, KHPI may be far slower in total return terms, but saves a lot more in 2020 or 2022 like crashes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Glimpses of this downside protection were visible in the sharp but limited-time drawdowns of April 2025. You may see that gap even magnify further if the crash is deeper. This risk reward characteristic difference versus peers is a long term structural advantage, and remains always applicable, although invisible for large stretches of play.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_6e29bc681e441e329dd9dc6fb63d2274.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_6e29bc681e441e329dd9dc6fb63d2274.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_6e29bc681e441e329dd9dc6fb63d2274.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_6e29bc681e441e329dd9dc6fb63d2274.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Aggressive Option Writing Layer</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The option layer consists of a call spread layer with the short call almost at the money now and a buy call layer ~3% away. This layer holds around 457 SPX contracts. Like the put layer, this layer also translates to ~$315m, which means full coverage of the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The balance of this covered call layer is important because there is a protective put layer to fund, while keeping the strategy net positive in income terms. KHPI achieves this balance by moving the protective put away (~6% away from spot as discussed before in today's setup. KHPI also aims to capture some sharp rallies too, which is why there is a buy call position ~3% away from the written call. The net effect of this setup is to ensure there is sufficient protection for more extreme drawdowns, while upsides are generally capped, but sharp upsides are somewhat captured.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, if markets stay flat it will earn some premiums from an aggressive portfolio coverage (100% coverage unlike a lot of peer covered call ETFs) closer to spot, despite funding bought puts and calls further away from the strike. So, overall KHPI earns smaller but surer income when markets are consolidating such as now, and as expected for most of 2026. Income is maximized if there are sharp rallies, remain in play when markets consolidate. And for long term holders, any tail risk event is when KHPI resets and starts much higher in any ensuing rebound phase. The net effect of this setup is that KHPI's total returns are not as exciting as say a SPYI or a GPIX, but its aggressive option writing layer enables a protective element that should work out over full cycles. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_4e535edd7fc2d7bb7135275405ffb5d1.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_4e535edd7fc2d7bb7135275405ffb5d1.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_4e535edd7fc2d7bb7135275405ffb5d1.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_4e535edd7fc2d7bb7135275405ffb5d1.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This setup works very well for a 2026-like market where the sharp upside probability appears lower. We have a hedge against potential corrections and an income source for consolidation regimes. The loss in momentum in the S&amp;P 500 is already evident in the past 3-4 months and more of that slow grind up (or a flat regime) is likely to persist for a few more quarters. I have <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872479-schgs-upgrade-engine-is-losing-steam-time-to-temper-expectations\">recently written</a> about how the markets are now re-evaluating the way they underwrite long duration risks. The AI-led rally that dominated 2024-25, will therefore likely see a phase where earnings grow into valuations and markets remain flat till another strong round of earnings revisions led by AI monetization emerges, and the capex drag dilutes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>A Strong Income Strategy</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">KHPI's yield is currently high single digits - not too aggressive like in the case of some peer ETFs who may see higher NAV erosion over time as a lot of distributions are funded through a return of capital mechanism. The expense ratio is slightly high at ~0.96% compared to 0.68% in the case of SPYI and 0.29% for a more active strategy like GPIX. I checked the distribution characteristics across a few months (sample December breakdown <a href=\"https://www.kensingtonassetmanagement.com/wp-content/uploads/KHPI-Fund-19a1-Notice-11.30.25-Confidential.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) and saw that distributions are predominantly labeled as return of capital. That is distributions are typically not taxed immediately, but their cost basis is reduced, which can defer taxes yet increase future capital gains if shares are sold - this is neutral to slightly positive for tax deferral, but not inherently free income.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">KHPI's suitability for a long term income portfolio is high. Its setup is well poised for a more immediate term of consolidation as well. I rate KHPI as a Strong Buy for income focused investors - this on risk reward balance rather than total returns.</p>",

I'll discuss these fundamentals in the article below, and I hope that at the end of it, you'll agree that AVLV's active and balanced approach is deserving of a \"buy\" rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Per its <a href=\"https://www.avantisinvestors.com/avantis-investments/avantis-us-large-cap-value-etf/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">website</a>, AVLV's primary investment objective is long-term capital appreciation, though it does offer a modest 1.20% dividend yield that's in line with broad market funds like SPY. The website also provides a brief overview of the active strategy used, as follows:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. Invests in a broad set of U.S. large-cap companies and is designed to increase expected returns by focusing on firms trading at what we believe are low valuations with higher profitability ratios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. Pursues the benefits associated with indexing (diversification, low turnover, transparency of exposures), but with the ability to add value by making investment decisions using information in current prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. Efficiency portfolio management and trading process that is designed to enhance returns while seeking to reduce unnecessary risks and costs for investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">4. Built to fit seamlessly into an investor's asset allocation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, AVLV is designed to be a high-quality, well-diversified fund that trades at favorable valuation ratios, and a quick glance at my latest factor scores confirms this description is reasonably accurate. As the table shows, AVLV's 44.3% concentration in its top ten sub-industries is quite low, and its 6.81/10 value score is the best of the four. Arguably, its 6.85/10 quality score could be better, but the counterpoint to that is that AVLV doesn't really have any significant gaps on any factor. That, along with its low 0.15% expense ratio, is the appeal, and it's why I labeled it an \"affordable all-weather large-cap value ETF\" two years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720389172041955_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1742\" data-height=\"220\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720389172041955_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AVLV vs. CGDV vs. VTV vs. SPY Factor Scores\" width=\"640\" height=\"81\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720389172041955_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720389172041955_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720389172041955_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720389172041955_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor (ETF Compare Tool)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CGDV and SPY have some gaps on the value and size factors, which explains why they've mostly missed out on this year's rotation. Meanwhile, VTV, like AVLV, also has good value and size factor exposure, but its 2.25/10 growth score could cause trouble if growth stocks rebound this year, and its 3.18/10 sentiment score suggests its holdings aren't delivering the kinds of earnings surprises required to sustain their recent price momentum.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV Performance Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Broadly speaking, that's my fundamental take on each ETF, but before diving into the specific statistics that lead to these scores, I want to look at AVLV's performance. Unfortunately, in order to include CGDV in the analysis, I had to exclude AVLV's returns prior to March 2022 (seven months), but it should still be helpful in understanding the kinds of returns AVLV shareholders can expect in bull and bear markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720398210796447_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1741\" data-height=\"423\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720398210796447_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AVLV vs. CGDV vs. VTV vs. SPY Performance Statistics\" width=\"640\" height=\"155\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720398210796447_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720398210796447_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720398210796447_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720398210796447_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor (ETF Performance Analytics Tool)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown, AVLV's 14.66% annualized returns since March 2022 ranked second best, as did its risk-adjusted returns (0.65 Sharpe Ratio) and downside risk-adjusted returns (0.98 Sortino Ratio). Its 17.57% standard deviation is slightly alarming, but its maximum drawdown and worst twelve-month figures were in line with VTV's, and that's something I believe is aided by its decent quality score. High-quality stocks, at least as I define them, have strong margins and high capital efficiency ratios, and it's my belief that these make them bounce back reasonably fast after market downturns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Being resilient is a necessary part of AVLV's strategy because it's actually the only ETF in this group to have a single-month loss of more than 10% (-11.9% in June 2022). Fortunately, AVLV gained 8.1% the following month and 13.0% in October 2022, so its high standard deviation figure is simply a reminder that investors should be able to tolerate large price swings in both directions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772040115620746_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1742\" data-height=\"817\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772040115620746_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AVLV vs. CGDV vs. VTV vs. SPY Performance Returns Distribution Profile - Balanced\" width=\"640\" height=\"300\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772040115620746_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772040115620746_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772040115620746_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772040115620746_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor (ETF Performance Analytics Tool)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV Fundamental Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I mentioned, AVLV's strength is that it's fundamentally well-balanced, which is why I've included statistics covering each of the major factors for its top 20 holdings. Again, diversification is a strength, with just 43% allocated to these 20 stocks, but generally, I hope you'll agree that AVLV has very few weak spots right now, which is why it's such a good choice right now regardless of the market environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720409267409804_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1758\" data-height=\"921\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720409267409804_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AVLV Fundamental Analysis - Top 20 Holdings\" width=\"640\" height=\"335\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720409267409804_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720409267409804_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720409267409804_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720409267409804_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor (ETF Snapshots Tool)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, AVLV's five-year portfolio beta of 1.02 is a bit elevated for a large-cap value fund, especially compared to VTV's 0.85. However, I don't think that's too big of an issue for investors with a moderate time horizon, and if you're trying to decide between the two, I'd like to highlight AVLV's superior return on total capital (14.58% vs. 10.58%). This key capital efficiency ratio means AVLV's holdings rely less on external financing than VTV's, and it's worth noting that AVLV also holds the advantage on ROA (9.97% vs. 6.46%) and ROE (26.98% vs. 20.70%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV is the cheapest of the four funds based on its 20.55x and 17.38x trailing and forward P/E ratios. It also offers a decent three-year historical EPS growth rate of 7.79% and an 11.55% one-year estimated EPS, which, once again, are superior to VTV. While you can technically get better growth for the price with CGDV or SPY, that's not AVLV's purpose. In a rotation to value, investors focus more on valuation ratios than growth rates, and that's why \"cheap\" funds like AVLV and VTV are outperforming this year. Even ETFs with terrible portfolio-level growth rates, like the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHD\" title=\"Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF\">SCHD</a>), are doing well, but the difference is that AVLV at least offers moderate earnings growth. That's why it easily outperformed SCHD from 2023 to 2025 and only modestly underperformed it in 2022 and 2026, the two years when value stock strategies were rewarded.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772049016623029_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1744\" data-height=\"284\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772049016623029_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AVLV vs. SCHD Performance Comparison\" width=\"640\" height=\"104\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772049016623029_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772049016623029_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772049016623029_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772049016623029_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I want to end on AVLV's strong diversification, further evidenced by its balanced sector mix where no sector accounts for more than 17% of the fund. In contrast, CGDV and SPY are more reliant on Technology at 28% and 33%, respectively, while VTV is 24% Financials. These compositions might work better in certain market regimes, but for consistently solid results, a balanced approach works best, which I believe will appeal most to passive investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720520089385364_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1748\" data-height=\"617\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720520089385364_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AVLV vs. CGDV vs. VTV vs. SPY Sector Allocation Analysis\" width=\"640\" height=\"226\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720520089385364_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720520089385364_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720520089385364_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720520089385364_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor (ETF Sector Comparison Tool)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Recommendation</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV's holdings may have changed since my review two years ago, but I'm pleased to see that management continues to take a well-diversified and well-balanced approach to large-cap value investing. In my opinion, that's appropriate for a core holding, and from a factor perspective, I don't see any major weaknesses worth flagging. Therefore, I've decided to reiterate my \"buy\" rating on AVLV, and I look forward to keeping the discussion going in the comments section below. Thank you for reading.</p>",

There are two segments within the company: Americas and International. The company has more than 13,000 employees around the globe and sports a current market cap just shy of $14B. As shown in the chart below, Allegion has underperformed the broad market, as measured by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>, by a significant margin over the past decade, returning less than 200%, while SPY has a total return north of 300%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/saupload_2a7447967393897ff46c94283b336770.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/saupload_2a7447967393897ff46c94283b336770.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/saupload_2a7447967393897ff46c94283b336770.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/saupload_2a7447967393897ff46c94283b336770.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Quality Financial Metrics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Personally, I believe there are three key quantitative metrics that all high-quality companies should possess: a growing revenue stream, stable margins, and a healthy return on invested capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The revenue per share for ALLE has grown at a solid pace over the past ten years, with 2020 providing the only down year, and it was minimal at just 3.3%. Following the pandemic, the RPS came back stronger, as it increased more than 8% in 2021 and climbed double-digits in 2022 (16%) and 2023 (11%). Since then it has continued to increase with a modest 4% rise in 2024 and another almost 10% jump last year. The revenue per share growth has been incredibly consistent, with 3-, 5-, and 10-year CAGRs all hovering between 8% and 9%, aided by management reducing the outstanding shares by approximately 10M over the past decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The gross profit margin has been relatively stable with some expansion mixed in. As indicated by the green line below, the GPM has typically lingered around the low 40s, with a chart low in 2022 a tick above 40%. Since that bottom point, this metric has climbed each year, achieving 43% in 2023, 44% in 2024, and more than 45% last fiscal year. The GPM expansion has stemmed from operational improvements, accretive acquisitions, and shedding non-core product lines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The final metric I want to look at is the return on invested capital, which is shown by the orange line on the chart. This metric has dwindled lower over the years, as it was at a chart high in 2018 at more than 20% before dipping to a low in 2020 of a still respectable 13.6%. Since then it's yet to eclipse the 20% mark again, coming in around 17% in 2023 and 2024 and just below 16% in fiscal 2025. I normally like to see an ROIC above 20%, and ideally ALLE will be able to surpass this target in the near future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771856566598986_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1438\" data-height=\"860\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771856566598986_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Allegion ALLE revenue per share RPS gross profit margin GPM return on invested capital ROIC\" width=\"640\" height=\"383\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771856566598986_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771856566598986_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771856566598986_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771856566598986_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Created by author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Data</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the past year, Allegion paid a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share; however, earlier this month, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4547575-allegion-raises-quarterly-dividend-by-8-to-055share\">the company raised its dividend by 8%</a> to $0.55. Following this dividend hike, Allegion now pays a forward dividend yield of around 1.37%, about 17% lower than it was a year ago. The dividend growth has slowed over the years but still remains above inflation, as the 10-year CAGR sits at more than 17%, while the 3 and 5-year CAGRs are more in line with the recent increase. The payout ratio has hovered around 30% over the last half-decade, which should enable the company to easily continue to raise its dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-17718752226241536_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1438\" data-height=\"864\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-17718752226241536_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Allegion ALLE dividend per share DPS payout ratio\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-17718752226241536_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-17718752226241536_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-17718752226241536_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-17718752226241536_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Created by Author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recent Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last week Allegion announced their Q4 2025 results, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.94, missing expectations by $0.04, on revenue of $1.03B, which also came up short of analyst estimates by about $5M. This revenue figure was a year-over-year increase of more than 9% overall and 3.3% organically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Americas segment posted a revenue jump of more than 6%, climbing from $750M to almost $800M, which was driven by a high-single-digit increase from the non-residential division. Strategic pricing and strong demand contributed to the success but were also aided by accretive acquisitions like Next Door Company and Trimco Hardware. Moreover, operating income also increased by over 6%, while the operating margin grew an immaterial amount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the Americas segment posted solid figures, the international segment fared much better, with revenue jumping from $193.8M to $237.7M, a 21% surge. Much of this increase occurred due to acquisitions too, with ALLE acquiring Lemaar in Australia, UAP Group in the U.K., and ELATEC, which is a German business known for RFID readers. Favorable foreign exchange rates also boosted these results, delivering a positive effect of almost 8%. However, it's worth noting that organic revenue in this segment declined a little more than 2% due to weak demand for mechanical products. Lastly, the operating income in this segment soared more than 66% to around $30M, mostly due to the aforementioned acquisitions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management also provided 2026 guidance, which projects organic revenue growth of 3% at the midpoint (compared to 4.1% in FY25), and total growth of 6% at the midpoint, supported by continued acquisitions and strong demand from the electronics business unit in the international market. Additionally, the company estimates 2026 earnings per share to be between $8.00 and $8.20, while adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $8.70 to $8.90.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the market was not fond of the earnings release, which can be read/listened to here, with shares tanking around 10%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The final consideration is to determine if ALLE is trading for an attractive valuation at its current levels, and in order to do so, we'll examine it from a free cash flow perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To give a little more context, I estimate a stock's implied fair value based on its free cash flow yield and specifically how the current yield compares to its historical average. This helps me gauge how much investors have typically been willing to pay for a company's free cash flow and how attractive the stock looks today relative to that history. The analysis is calculated on 12 years of daily historical price data, capturing the rolling 5-year average free cash flow yield for the past 7 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key assumption behind this valuation model is that investors have paid a fair price for the stock over the past 5 years, on average. However, since every valuation is an estimate, there is a +/-10% margin of error applied to the fair value range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771876349765985_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1456\" data-height=\"856\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771876349765985_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Allegion ALLE free cash flow valuation free cash flow/price free cash flow/p fcf/price fcf/p\" width=\"640\" height=\"376\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771876349765985_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771876349765985_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771876349765985_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771876349765985_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Created by Author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on my custom valuation model, shares of Allegion look to be trading for a moderate discount to their fair value, with a current price of about $158 and an estimated fair value slightly above $170. The company has seen strong free cash flow growth since 2023, when it jumped 30%, and 2024 and 2025 incurred double-digit increases, leading to the rise in valuation zones.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The estimated long-term expected rate of return for Allegion is a healthy 11.14%, with the components of that figure coming from a forward dividend yield of 1.31%, a return to fair value factor of 1.92%, and an approximate future earnings growth rate of near 8%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, Allegion has performed well for itself over the past ten years but has come up short compared to the overall market. The company has some encouraging financials, with robust revenue per share growth, expanding margins, and a pretty consistent return on invested capital. The dividend has been paid and raised for over a decade, with stable dividend growth just shy of 10%. The recent earnings report was not well-received by the market, but it might've given investors a potentially good entry point.</p>",

I've maintained that bullish outlook since the company's IPO. Even though I acknowledge that my January buy call was ill-timed (I certainly wasn't predicting the sharp selloff in tech that would ensue), my thesis on Figure remains sound. I view the company as an incredibly differentiated innovator in the blockchain that is poised to displace and take market share from incumbent lenders: not just in mortgage originations, but now in auto financing as well. I reiterate my <strong>buy </strong>rating here. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Figure's immense growth within its existing consumer loan marketplace is astounding (more detail in the next section), but what investors should be aware of today is the fact that the company is planning a broad extension of its platform in 2026. Figure built its platform and its name brand around one type of loan, the HELOC (home equity line of credit). But in itself, HELOC loans are relatively niche product that form a very small share of overall borrowing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2026, the company is focused on expanding two loan types. The first is primary, first-lien mortgages. Already, the company is showcasing tremendous growth in first lien, with volumes rising roughly 3x y/y in the fourth quarter to $506 million. Still, first lien (standard mortgages) represents only 19% of the company's origination volume. Figure's management also notes that it typically is able to issue a standard mortgage with a total cost of under $1,000 (thanks to automating many manual portions of the underwriting process, and with higher credit accuracy) versus an industry average of $11,045, marking a clear advantage for lenders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498713590522_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2320\" data-height=\"1202\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498713590522_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure first lien issuance trends\" width=\"640\" height=\"332\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"332\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498713590522_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498713590522_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498713590522_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498713590522_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure first lien issuance trends <span>(Figure Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next expansion area is completely beyond housing. Figure has <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/agora-data-partners-with-figure-to-tokenize-auto-loans-93CH-4529801\" rel=\"nofollow\">struck a partnership</a> with a company called Agora Data, which describes itself as an AI-powered intelligence platform for auto loan originators to predict performance of subprime auto loans and to connect lenders to capital. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Agora gives Figure easy access to its base of auto lenders, marking its first foray into an auto lending TAM that is sized at a staggering $1.6 trillion. While Agora's platform is responsible for origination in this deal (which is Figure's role in home loans), Figure's role is to use its newly-launched Figure Connect to tokenize these loans into assets on the blockchain: which makes it easier and less costly for auto loan originators to securitize and sell their loans using the Figure platform.

The Q4 earnings summary is shown below:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499047433324_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1278\" data-height=\"1202\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499047433324_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure Q4 results\" width=\"640\" height=\"602\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"602\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499047433324_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499047433324_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499047433324_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499047433324_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure Q4 results <span>(Figure Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Figure's revenue grew 91% y/y to $159.9 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $157.7 million (+88% y/y) by three-point margin. Important to note is the fact that Figure's revenue accelerated sharply from just 55% y/y growth in Q3. Similar to the prior quarter, Figure's y/y surge in revenue was driven primarily by Figure Exchange, the company's crypto trading platform which launched in midway through 2024 (revenue recorded in the \"ecosystem and technology fees\" line. Still, we note that crypto trading is only one-quarter of the company's overall revenue (despite now having negative associations with the crypto sector that has brought down Figure's stock tremendously). </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Core lines of business, meanwhile, also thrived. The chart below showcases the company's main business driver: the amount of loans originated through the company's platform. Consumer loan marketplace volume surged 131% y/y to $2.71 billion in Q4, which accelerated versus just 63% full-year growth across the entirety of FY25.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499189176812_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1274\" data-height=\"332\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499189176812_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure loan volumes\" width=\"640\" height=\"167\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"167\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499189176812_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499189176812_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499189176812_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499189176812_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure loan volumes <span>(Figure Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, it's the expansion of loan types that is potentially feeding growth acceleration here, as the company focuses more on first-lien originations (which not only is a larger market than home equity lines, but also tend to have higher loan balances). The company's 2026 foray into auto loans should only serve to add fuel to recent growth trends. We note as well that Figure's take rates (its revenue as a percentage of origination volume) jumped 30bps y/y to 3.8%, which is a major tailwind for revenue growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue from the company's loan servicing arm grew 30% y/y to $9.0 million, while loan originations grew 65% y/y to $22.4 million. We focus on these core lending activities because they are Figure's \"bread and butter\" and provide recurring revenue for the company, even if Figure Exchange's crypto trading results become choppier heading into 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the profitability front, Figure's adjusted EBITDA grew roughly 5x y/y to $81.3 million, representing a 51.6% margin that improved more than 30 points y/y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499322975366_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1288\" data-height=\"902\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499322975366_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure adjusted EBITDA\" width=\"640\" height=\"448\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"448\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499322975366_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499322975366_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499322975366_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499322975366_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure adjusted EBITDA <span>(Figure Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has a near-term goal of hitting 60% adjusted EBITDA margins, which it's driving via a greater mix of capital-light, third-party loans as well as efficiencies and automation applied to the company's own overhead. Per CFO Minchung Kgil's remarks on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875872-figure-technology-solutions-inc-figr-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 earnings call:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Our medium-term goal for adjusted EBITDA margin is to be above 60%, and our progress this quarter can be explained as follows: First, we are growing volume and assets in Figure Connect and democratized Prime that reduce balance sheet usage and improve contribution margins as more volume moves into our capital-light marketplace. Second, we are seeing our contribution margin from partner-branded volume continue to be around 80% as we have built out the core infrastructure that powers Figure Connect and our partner-branded initiatives. And third, we continue to execute on operating leverage across both fixed and variable expense categories, where our volume increased 131% and our operating expenses, excluding share-based compensation, increased 13% over the same period.\"</p></blockquote> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation And Key Takeaways</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite its rapid growth opportunities, we find that Figure also remains attractively valued. For most of last year, Figure traded at unjustifiable multiples of its bottom line; and now, after its stock price sank, we can no longer say the same.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_e4a4aff10cc7806cfb789432fcda3d83.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_e4a4aff10cc7806cfb789432fcda3d83.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_e4a4aff10cc7806cfb789432fcda3d83.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_e4a4aff10cc7806cfb789432fcda3d83.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown above, Figure takes at roughly <strong>18x forward adjusted EBITDA. </strong>An exact peer set for Figure is tough since its business is so unique, but Figure trades in line with a number of adjacent peers. Coinbase (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COIN\" title=\"Coinbase Global, Inc.\">COIN</a>), which is the number-two crypto exchange, trades at similar ~17x adjusted EBITDA levels to Figure after its recent selloff. Another interesting direct competitor in home lending is legacy incumbent Rocket Mortgage (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RKT\" title=\"Rocket Companies, Inc.\">RKT</a>), which recently purchased Mr. Cooper and Redfin to become a one-stop shop consisting of a real estate brokerage, a mortgage originations platform, and a mortgage servicing arm. Against all of these peers, however, none can match Figure's ~2x y/y top-line growth and its incredible margin expansion trends.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stay long here and use the post-earnings dip as a buying opportunity.</p>",

The company's AI GPUs are clearly gaining traction in adoption and that's showing up in their financial performance.

Despite worries about stiff competition from other GPU suppliers like Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) and ASICs designers like Broadcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>), AMD seems to be holding its ground nicely. At CES, the company also unveiled their state of the art Instinct MI440X and so it is clear that their innovation is doing the talking. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before this latest earnings season, there were concerns that the hyperscalers will cut back on CAPEX with the payoff from these investments still being rather obscure. However, these worries were proven to be unfounded just recently. In their latest earnings report earlier this month, Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) announced that<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4548486-amazon-shocked-wall-street-with-its-2026-spending-plan-which-companies-could-benefit\"> they will spend $200 billion</a>. This comes after Alphabet's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) estimate of $175 billion to $185 billion in capital spending for 2026 and so at this point, there really are no signs that the major cloud service providers are letting up on CAPEX. The competition in that space is fierce and for a GPU provider like AMD, the tailwinds are likely to be strong moving forward. In Q4, data center growth accelerated and there is no evidence that momentum will fade any time soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">International expansion is also top of mind for the company. By now it is no secret that India is becoming an increasingly vibrant center for AI development. About ten days ago, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4552263-amd-deepens-india-push-with-tcs-in-bid-to-rival-nvidia\">it was announced that</a> AMD and Tata Consultancy Services will broaden their strategic partnership. As Preeti Singh of Seeking Alpha writes, they will</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>introduce AMD’s “Helios” rack-scale AI architecture in India, stepping up competition with Nvidia in one of the world’s fastest-growing technology markets.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the U.S. is of course AMD's largest and most important market, the company's strategic decision to look to international markets like India for growth is a smart one in my view. The recent AI summit in the country clearly shows they are becoming an important source of infrastructure demand as well as innovation. As stated, this also helps them to compete with Nvidia globally. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, AMD made headlines with their massive Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) deal just yesterday (Feb 24th). <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4555727-amd-to-deploy-up-to-6-gw-of-ai-chips-for-metas-ai-infrastructure\">It was announced that</a> Meta will deploy up to 6 GW of Instinct chips to power their infrastructure and that this agreement is multiyear and multi-generation. Firstly, it is obvious that this is a major financial win for AMD. CFO Jean Hu stated that</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We expect this partnership to drive substantial multi-year revenue growth and be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings per share, marking another significant step forward in delivering on our ambitious long-term financial model.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Secondly, this is another major vote of confidence regarding the competitiveness of AMD's GPUs. As stated earlier, there were worries regarding stiff competition from Nvidia and Broadcom. I believe this massive Meta deal shows that AMD's solutions have matured and are now a formidable alternative to the top chips out there right now. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability Is Solid</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-17720505112657673_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1322\" data-height=\"655\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-17720505112657673_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Profitability\" width=\"640\" height=\"317\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"317\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-17720505112657673_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-17720505112657673_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-17720505112657673_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-17720505112657673_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>AMD Q4 Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q4, it seems that AMD has controlled costs well. You can see above that their adjusted gross margin expanded by 3 percentage points YoY. This could also be a signal of increased competitiveness in their products and thus better pricing power. Regardless of where this gross margin strength is coming from, investors should obviously be encouraged.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the control of expenses, things perhaps could have been a little bit better. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased by 1 percentage point YoY. If you go to their income statement, you'll see that marketing, general and administrative expenses growth outpaced the R&amp;D expense increase and so corporate efficiency may be slightly weaker than desired. Still, with the gross margin strength being a major driver, operating margin still saw expansion of 2 percentage points to show that AMD remains a generally well run business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, for the bottom line, the company posted an adjusted EPS of $1.53, up 40% YoY. This outpaced the top line growth rate and beat analyst expectations by $0.21 and so there really shouldn't be many complaints regarding their profitability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Quarterly Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772051236381334_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1164\" data-height=\"467\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772051236381334_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Outlook\" width=\"640\" height=\"257\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"257\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772051236381334_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772051236381334_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772051236381334_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772051236381334_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>AMD Q4 Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AMD provided guidance for their 2026 Q1. For revenue, they are expecting to see around $9.8 billion at the midpoint. This implies<a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_745481f08707ef4a10b5e2d007a99d6d/amd/news/2025-05-06_AMD_Reports_First_Quarter_2025_Financial_1247.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"> a YoY growth rate of 32%.</a> While that is another modest deceleration of growth from Q4 levels, I would say that this is still enough to show that business activity will remain robust for the company as a whole moving forward. Furthermore, it should be stated that they guided revenue ~$430 million <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4546578-earnings-snapshot-amd-posts-record-q4-results-beating-analysts-consensus\">above consensus expectations</a> and so the outlook looks quite good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For gross margin, they are projecting 55% and that would be an improvement from 54% in the year ago quarter. Therefore, the cost control and pricing power strength we talked about earlier is set to continue. Lastly, for operating expenses, they see around $3.05 billion for Q1. That represents a 38% jump. Since this outpaces the estimated top line growth rate, expect expense control to be mixed relatively speaking.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a whole, I view the near term outlook quite favorably, but investors should really focus even more on the increasingly strong long term growth story for their data center segment. Note on their earnings call, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4546760-amd-outlines-path-to-60-percent-annual-data-center-growth-and-multi-billion-ai-revenue-by\">CEO Lisa Su stated that </a></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We are well positioned to grow Data Center segment revenue by more than 60% annually over the next 3 to 5 years and scale our AI business to tens of billions in annual revenue in 2027.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_2b143adfada2d17de2a615bdf12c7f69.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_2b143adfada2d17de2a615bdf12c7f69.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_2b143adfada2d17de2a615bdf12c7f69.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_2b143adfada2d17de2a615bdf12c7f69.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AMD's forward P/E ratio has more than halved from the late 2025 peak. At a current reading of just 31.87, I believe the stock has reached bargain levels again. In today's article, it was shown that the company as a whole is performing well. In the in-depth look at their data center segment it was shown that growth is accelerating and recent developments are favorable. Hyperscalers are upping their spending, AMD's push into India is well justified, and the Meta deal is of course a big deal. No pun intended. With the near term outlook looking quite solid and long term tailwinds being strong, I view the company's fundamentals as robust and the prospects as being bright.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that in mind, the forward P/E ratio's rather sharp contraction over the past few months is really a sign of irrational worry and concern. AMD has the numbers, the contracts, and partnerships to show that they have become a force to be reckoned with instead of being a distant competitor to Nvidia and Broadcom. As a result, I view the current valuation as highly opportunistic.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are some risks that investors should have in mind. Firstly, by now it is no secret that the tech sector is feeling the effects of a memory chip shortage. Do note that while AMD's data center segment has taken virtually all the spotlight, the company also has a large Client and Gaming business. There are worries that the memory chip shortage could potentially weigh on PC sales and other consumer electronics. For AMD, since they do still have a good amount of exposure to this space, their company-wide financial performance may still be adversely effected even if their data center segment booms. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another potential risk <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4548407-intel-amd-notify-customers-in-china-of-lengthy-waits-for-cpus-reuters\">is CPU shortages</a> for the Chinese market. Earlier this month it was reported that both Intel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC\" title=\"Intel Corporation\">INTC</a>) and AMD had to notify Chinese customers that there were shortages and that deliveries had to be pushed back. For AMD specifically, delivery lead times for select products were pushed back 8 to 10 weeks. Obviously, this has the potential to have near term impacts to their business activity in one of the world's largest markets for CPUs. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in April of last year, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/bay-area-ideas/analysis?ticker=amd\">I called AMD stock a no-brainer.</a> I believe the company has earned that title back. In today's analysis, it was shown that they are seeing a great deal of momentum in their all-important data center segment. Growth is accelerating and new deals clearly show that they have become a true major GPU supplier instead of being just a challenger on the outside looking in. While the prospects are arguably as bright as ever, the valuation has more than halved since the peak in late 2025 and so the attractiveness of the stock has increased immensely despite the risks highlighted above. As a result, I have decided to upgrade AMD to a strong buy rating.</p>",

Since then, it has moved up 74%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My argument at that time was the company’s focus on green energy threatened profitability. I regard that as standing the test of time: Last year’s net profit was £1.3bn, a 45% decline from the equivalent number for 2021. Last year’s reported earnings per share of £1.08, a decline of 51%. The adjusted earnings per share last year showed growth versus 2021, though: you picks your reporting metric and you takes your choice…</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capital Expenditure Is Set to Remain High</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In November, the company published a <a href=\"https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/uk/scottish_southern_energy3/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=1&amp;newsid=2005630\" rel=\"nofollow\">strategic update</a> that, in the company’s words, would \"significantly increas(e) the Group's exposure to UK electricity Networks, and driv(e) long-term value creation with attractive regulated asset value and earnings growth.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This comes at a projected cost of £33bn (fully funded) over five years. Around four-fifths of that is to be spent on regulated UK electricity networks and the remainder on “Renewables and system Flexibilty” (SSE loves idiosyncratic use of uppercase letters).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That reflects a pragmatic shift in my view. The green push of some years ago has fallen out of fashion, explaining shifts in capital allocation priorities at firms including BP (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BP\" title=\"BP p.l.c.\">BP</a>), and I think SSE is also shifting its approach in this regard, something I see as positive for the investment case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But what about the expenditure? We have seen at other U.K. utilities such as National Grid (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NGG\" title=\"National Grid plc\">NGG</a>) that heavy network capex costs can lead to a dividend cut. In National Grid’s case, even after a rights issue and dividend cut, the net debt has continued to grow. As I explain below, SSE itself is no stranger to dividend cuts even before this latest spending plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of the £33bn, the firm reckons £21bn will come from operational cash flow. But the other £14bn is set to come from an “increase in adjusted net debt and hybrid capital.” The company didn’t bother defining “hybrid capital” in its release, although in its (long) “alternative performance measures” section in its most recent results, it says “Adjusted Net Debt and Hybrid Capital” equates most closely to the IFRS measure of “Unadjusted net debt.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Adjusted net debt and hybrid capital as of September 2025 stood at £11.4bn, so another £21bn is a substantial expansion, even over a five-year period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That strikes me as an unwelcome development for the balance sheet. On the plus side, the company reckons this will be transformative for earnings. It says, “investments made in Networks and selective Renewables and system Flexibility projects are expected to drive a step-up in earnings of around 50% over the plan, with an adjusted Earnings Per Share CAGR of between 7 - 9% delivering 225 - 250 pence in 2029/30”.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That certainly sounds impressive, but, first, I’d like to see it in practice rather than take it as given ahead of time, and, secondly, if earnings are set to grow significantly, why not fund the whole lot from operational cash flows? The answer, I presume, would be that the spend is presented on a five-year timeline, but the operational cashflow benefits should ultimately flow for much longer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, I think there is an element of “prove it” here before getting excited about this prospect. SSE’s capital allocation track record does not necessarily inspire confidence, while examples like National Grid point to the dangers of capex-heavy infrastructural spend adding to net debt and putting strain on dividend funding.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend is Not Compelling</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most recent interim dividend was raised by around 1%: not exciting at all compared to some U.K. utilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From 1999 to 2019 – a 20-year run – the company grew its dividend per share annually. It then cut it in 2020 by 18% and then cut it again in 2024, by 38%.

The interim increase this year was therefore especially weak, but it could be made up for at the full-year level in order to deliver on the target.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, the dividend history is not reassuring at all when it comes to SSE’s commitment to the dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current yield of 2.5% is also underwhelming, not just for a utility stock but more generally given that even after falling due to a high price, the current FTSE 100 yield is 3.1%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">I Still See the Valuation as Too High</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since my sell piece in 2021, a 74% price gain has proven my approach wrong. Still, just as I thought the company was overpriced then, I still do today and maintain a sell rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a <a href=\"https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/SSE/q3-trading-statement/17444982\" rel=\"nofollow\">trading statement</a> this month, the company said it expects adjusted earnings per share to be £1.44- £1.52. On an adjusted basis, that implies a prospective P/E ratio of around 17. Bear in mind that this is on an adjusted basis. First-half earnings per share (26.4p) were 27% lower than adjusted earnings per share for the period. Using that ratio as a proxy (a crude approach, but helpful to illustrate the point), then the prospective P/E ratio would be more like 23.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That to me looks overpriced.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What about using a cash flow-based valuation metric? The enterprise value is £42bn, based on £31bn of market cap plus this year’s interim point “net debt and hybrid capital” of £11bn (note: as the company says: ”reported net debt excludes equity classified hybrid capital, see Alternative Performance Measures section”). Last year, cash generated from operations was £2.6bn. So the ratio of enterprise value to cash generated from operations is 16. Again, that looks high to me.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SSE is solidly profitable, and its new five-year strategy ought to embed it yet further in an area of the U.K. economy that benefits from long-term demand and visibility of pricing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I also see some disadvantages to its business model, and despite a rising share price, I think the direction of travel on dividends over the past couple of decades shows a business that has become less, not more, able to create shareholder value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At its current price, I continue to see it as overvalued and therefore unattractive from an investment perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It will be worth monitoring how the current strategic plan starts to feed into the business, not only in terms of profit but also the balance sheet and whether the expected costs remain the same or rise over the course of the five-year plan.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Rodriguez/Getty Images Entertainment</p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"inline_ad_placeholder\"></div> <h2>A Quarter with Mixed Developments</h2> <p>The Honest Company (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HNST\" title=\"The Honest Company, Inc.\">HNST</a></span>) reported Q4 2025 results on February 25, 2026, highlighting balance sheet strength and early traction in its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4844205-the-honest-company-stock-reducing-complexity\">transformation</a> while setting expectations for 2026. Some<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> developments were clearly positive. Others indicate that progress may materialize at a more gradual pace. I focus my analysis on organic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, as these are the metrics that allow for an apple-to-apple comparison as the company executes on its transformation strategy. Below are the key developments and my assessment for them.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>1. Enhanced Cash Levels</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was the highlight of the quarter, as the cash balance expanded from $71 million in Q3 2025 to $90 million in Q4 2025. For a quarter where the company exited multiple channels and categories, this growth in cash levels is quite notable. Moreover, HNST is a debt-free company, and cash accounts for 35% of its market capitalization as of the close on February 25, 2026.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>2. The First Share Repurchase Program</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the company’s strong balance sheet, it <a href=\"https://investors.honest.com/news-releases/news-release-details/honest-company-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced a share repurchase program of $25 million</a>. During the conference call, management highlighted that they view the company’s valuation as low and that they intend to repurchase shares opportunistically. This is a good development and will likely act as a catalyst for the share price in the near term.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>3. Results Were Within Guidance Range</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For FY2025, HNST posted a 5.3% increase in organic revenue, which was in the mid-range of its 4% to 6% growth guidance. FY2025 adjusted EBITDA was $21.8 million and was in the bottom half of the guidance range of $21 million to $23 million. Though this does not qualify as a bad outcome, it suggests that growth will take time despite the pivot to better-performing categories.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>4. FY2026 Guidance Is Somewhat Underwhelming</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is guiding for organic revenue growth of 4% to 6% (Figure 1). It is also guiding to adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 70 to 150 basis points. Given that the company is dropping roughly a fifth of its revenue base to focus on categories with better prospects and profitability, this guidance appears soft. I view the guidance as conservative and likely to be revised upward as the year progresses.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>5. Accelerate Beyond Baby</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is focusing more on households without babies. This entails expanding into personal care products catered to kids and widening the wipes offering to better serve adults. These product extensions represent a natural evolution of the core product line, making it a low hanging fruit.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>6. Improved Inventory Management</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company aims to transition from two warehouses to a single location. This optimization project is expected to be operational in 2H2026. Management seems to be very optimistic about this project and the efficiencies that it expects to extract out of it.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>7. Diapers Likely to Remain Challenged In 20226 </strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Diapers account for around 30% of HNST sales and have seen significant headwinds in 2025. There is a trend of consumers moving towards lower-priced items due to economic pressures. This is a major problem for HNST, as its diaper offering is positioned as a premium offering. Also, there was an issue with Target (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT\" title=\"Target Corporation\">TGT</a>), where the company had to simplify its product offering. The issue with Target is behind us, but the macro headwind remains in play. The category is likely to register flat to negative growth in 2026. This would explain the soft growth in organic sales guidance, as the company’s second largest category remains pressured.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Figure 1: FY2026 Management Guidance</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720788702944093.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Forecast\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"510\" height=\"319\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720788702944093.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720788702944093.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720788702944093.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Compiled by Author using data from the company</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Share Price</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The share price of HNST has been on major correction for the past twelve months. The stock has fallen by 58.5% during this period and currently trades very close to its 52-week low. Is the stock ready to switch gears and start climbing upwards? Well, the transformation resulted in a reported net loss of $23.6 million, but that was mostly write-downs that did not impact the company’s fundamentals. As discussed earlier, the company was able to enhance its cash position, as it benefited from a favorable working capital movement as it exited some product categories and channels. The announcement of the first share buyback program is likely to install confidence among investors that bad times are behind us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Figure 2: HNST Share Price</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720789145119288_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1959\" data-height=\"738\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720789145119288_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Share price\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"241\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720789145119288_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720789145119288_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720789145119288_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720789145119288_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">HNST is trading at an EV-to-Sales (Forward) of 0.57x based on the midpoint of management’s sales guidance for FY2026. This is well below the consumer staples sector median of 1.52x. This shows that the stock has a lot of scope to rerate upwards once investors start believing that the transformation is on the right track. Thus, I share the same view as management that the current share price valuation does not reflect the structural improvement that is taking hold.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Macro headwinds and tariffs are the key risks facing HNST. The weak macro conditions facing consumers were heavily emphasized by management in the Q4 2025 earnings call. Given that HNST products sell at more premium pricing, the company could face slower sales than anticipated. Consumers could downshift to save money, and this leaves the diapers category the most exposed. Tariffs have increased product costs and will remain a headwind until Q2 2026. Also, the company is in the midst of a transformation process, and there are no guarantees that this plan would work.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that HNST posted results with more positives than negatives. Importantly, the balance sheet strengthened during a turnaround quarter. The company is guiding for improved adjusted EBITDA margin driven by a more favorable sales mix. The company is competing in categories where it has a strong value proposition and is looking to solidify its position. Given its low valuation, the stock appears positioned for a potential rebound. I maintain my Bbuyrating on the shares.</p>",

This volatility provided an opportunity for us to purchase stocks with what we saw as attractive long-term upside to intrinsic value across a diverse set of industries. At quarter end, the fund had overweights in more economically sensitive stocks than its benchmark and peers.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notable Additions:</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Charles River Laboratories: This leading contract research organization ('CRO') supports the discovery, development and safe manufacture of new drugs, biologics, vaccines and medical devices. It has a diversified portfolio with exposure to high growth therapeutic areas. Slower spending on biotech and pharma research and development has been a headwind to the stock, which gave us an opportunity to invest at what we saw as an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Globus Medical (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GMED\" title=\"Globus Medical, Inc.\">GMED</a>): This medical technology company specializes in musculoskeletal solutions for spine, orthopedic trauma and joint reconstruction. The company has faced issues with recent acquisitions, supply chain issues and weakness in its robotics segment, which together provided an opportunity to purchase the stock at what we saw as an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ArcBest (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARCB\" title=\"ArcBest Corporation\">ARCB</a>): This logistics and freight transportation company operates less-than-truckload ('LTL') shipping, which is used for shipments too large for parcel delivery but too small for a full truckload. The trucking industry has been in a multi-year cyclical downturn; however, we believe ArcBest's operational efficiency and technological advancements using artificial intelligence ('AI') should position the company well once demand recovers.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notable Sales:</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart Industries (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GTLS\" title=\"Chart Industries, Inc.\">GTLS</a>): A global leader in cryogenic and gas-handling technologies, the company provides highly engineered equipment to support a wide range of industries, with a focus on clean energy and industrial gas solutions. The company is being acquired by Baker Hughes (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BKR\" title=\"Baker Hughes Company\">BKR</a>) (not a fund holding) in an all-cash transaction expected to close in mid-2026. We opted to sell the stock to fund other opportunities we believe have better upside to intrinsic value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mastec (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTZ\" title=\"MasTec, Inc.\">MTZ</a>): An infrastructure contractor, delivering critical services across communications, energy, power and water systems, Mastec is involved with the AI infrastructure build-out for fiber networks and data centers. The stock rose in the fourth quarter, which gave us an opportunity to sell the position to fund opportunities we believe have more upside to intrinsic value.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sector breakdown (% of total market value)</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">■ Fund ■ Russell 2000 Value Index ('USD')</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/542689-17721607660364835_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"671\" data-height=\"786\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/542689-17721607660364835_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Horizontal bar chart comparing Fund and Russell 2000 Value Index (&lt;a href='https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USD' title='ProShares Ultra Semiconductors ETF'&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;) sector breakdowns.

Overall, performance drivers were largely stock specific.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Contributors to performance</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lumentum: Shares of this market-leading designer and manufacturer of innovative optical and photonic products rallied in the fourth quarter, fueled by apparent investor enthusiasm for its AI-driven growth potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Globus Medical: The orthopedic device maker reported better-than-expected financial results with strong organic growth and an increase in its forward earnings guidance. The company's recent acquisitions are expected to provide synergies that we believe should boost earnings in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Coherent: This laser company develops and manufactures optoelectronic components and devices. Its optical transceivers are key enablers for networking of AI servers. Shares rose due to surging AI data center demand, strong growth of networking revenue and expanding profit margins supported by a more focused, high-return product portfolio.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Detractors from performance</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AECOM: AECOM is a global infrastructure consulting and engineering firm that provides planning, design, construction and management for transportation, water, environmental, energy and building projects worldwide. The company reported better-than-expected earnings, but revenues were below expectations, driving the stock lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Crane NXT: This industrial technology company provides technological solutions to secure, detect and authenticate physical and digital assets. Shares declined amid reignited trade tensions with China. Though the company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue growth, management reduced its earnings outlook for the full year, which also sent shares lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PENN Entertainment: The company operates physical casinos in the US, along with a growing digital gaming and sports-betting platform. Shares declined after third quarter earnings missed expectations. The company's announcement ending its partnership with ESPN also seemed to dampen investor sentiment.</p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">References</h4> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Alpha (cash adjusted) is a measure of performance on a risk-adjusted basis. Beta (cash adjusted) is a measure of relative risk and the slope of regression. Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated using standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance. Information Ratio is a measurement of portfolio returns beyond the returns of a benchmark, usually an index, compared to the volatility of those returns. Standard deviation measures a fund's range of total returns and identifies the spread of a fund's short-term fluctuations. Tracking Error is defined as the expected standard deviation of a portfolio's excess return over the benchmark index return. The up and down capture measures how well a manager was able to replicate or improve on periods of positive benchmark returns and how severely the manager was affected by periods of negative benchmark returns. Maximum Drawdown is the maximum observed loss from a high to a low of a portfolio, before a new high is attained. Maximum drawdown is an indicator of downside risk over a specified time period. Weighted Average Market Cap is a measure of the average size of company held in a portfolio. The percentage of the portfolio invested each company, or its weight, is multiplied by its size (market capitalization). An average of the weighted size of all companies held is then calculated. Price/earnings measures the price per share relative to the earnings per share of the company while excluding extraordinary items. Price to book measures the firm's capitalization (market price) to book value. Est. 3-5 year EPS (Earning per share) growth measures the earning per share growth from FY3 to FY5. ROE is the Return on Equity that measures the fund's annual return relative to total shareholders' equity. This ratio evaluates how quickly investments can be turned into profits. Long-term debt to capital measures a fund's financial leverage by calculating the proportion of long-term debt used to finance its assets relative to the amount of equity used for the same purpose. A higher ratio indicates higher leverage. Operating margin measures the profit a fund makes for every dollar of sales after paying the variable expenses. Contribution to Return measures the performance impact from portfolio holdings over a defined time period. It takes into account both weight and performance of the portfolio holdings. Contribution to Return is calculated at security level.</li></ol> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p>Investment objective</p> <p>The fund seeks long-term growth of capital.</p> <p>Fund facts</p> <p>Fund AUM ($M) 8,173.74</p> <p>Portfolio managers</p> <p>Jonathan Edwards, Jonathan Mueller</p> <p> </p> <p>Standardized performance (%) as of December 31, 2025</p> <div class=\"table-responsive\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th> </th> <th> </th> <th>Quarter</th> <th>YTD</th> <th>1 Year</th> <th>3 Years</th> <th>5 Years</th> <th>10 Years</th> <th>Since Inception</th> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>Class A shares inception: 06/21/99</td> <td>NAV</td> <td>6.79</td> <td>17.64</td> <td>17.64</td> <td>21.66</td> <td>20.72</td> <td>14.64</td> <td>11.91</td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td>Max.

Attribution methodology notes: The attribution provides analysis of the effects of several portfolio management decisions, including allocation and security selection. Securities classified as \"Other\" may include non-equity securities, derivatives, and securities for which a sector classification may not be appropriate. The portfolio is actively managed and portfolio holdings are subject to change. The percentage weights represented for the portfolio are dollar weighted based on market value. Market allocation effect shows the excess contribution due to sector/market allocation. A positive allocation effect implies that the choice of sector weights in the portfolio added value to the portfolio contribution with respect to the benchmark and vice versa. Selection effect shows the excess contribution due to security selection. A positive selection effect implies that the choice of stocks in the portfolio added value to the portfolio contribution with respect to the benchmark and vice versa. Total effect is the difference in contribution between the benchmark and portfolio.

Beta (cash adjusted) is a measure of relative risk and the slope of regression. Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated using standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance. Information Ratio is a measurement of portfolio returns beyond the returns of a benchmark, usually an index, compared to the volatility of those returns. Standard deviation measures a fund's range of total returns and identifies the spread of a fund's short-term fluctuations. Tracking Error is defined as the expected standard deviation of a portfolio's excess return over the benchmark index return. The up and down capture measures how well a manager was able to replicate or improve on periods of positive benchmark returns and how severely the manager was affected by periods of negative benchmark returns. Maximum Drawdown is the maximum observed loss from a high to a low of a portfolio, before a new high is attained. Maximum drawdown is an indicator of downside risk over a specified time period. Weighted Average Market Cap is a measure of the average size of company held in a portfolio. The percentage of the portfolio invested each company, or its weight, is multiplied by its size (market capitalization). An average of the weighted size of all companies held is then calculated. Price/earnings measures the price per share relative to the earnings per share of the company while excluding extraordinary items. Price to book measures the firm's capitalization (market price) to book value. Est. 3-5 year EPS (Earning per share) growth measures the earning per share growth from FY3 to FY5. ROE is the Return on Equity that measures the fund's annual return relative to total shareholders' equity. This ratio evaluates how quickly investments can be turned into profits. Long-term debt to capital measures a fund's financial leverage by calculating the proportion of long-term debt used to finance its assets relative to the amount of equity used for the same purpose. A higher ratio indicates higher leverage. Operating margin measures the profit a fund makes for every dollar of sales after paying the variable expenses. Contribution to Return measures the performance impact from portfolio holdings over a defined time period. It takes into account both weight and performance of the portfolio holdings. Contribution to Return is calculated at security level.</p> <hr> <p>Morningstar</p> <p>Source: ©2025 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved.
