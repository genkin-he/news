The initial wave of this operation seems to<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> have focused on taking out Iranian missile launchers and potentially some of the Iranian leadership. Obviously, this is a major geopolitical event that could trigger significant and immediate shockwaves across the financial markets. Because this operation was launched late on a Friday evening (February 27th) and escalated over Saturday, and most of the global financial markets are closed, we have not seen the visible impacts on stocks. I have seen some social media posts suggesting the stock market could be due for a sharp plunge when markets reopen; however, I see some counterpoints to this argument. With all this in mind, let's examine the potential implications for various financial assets:</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <h3 data-path-to-node=\"4\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </h3> <p data-path-to-node=\"3,0\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><b data-path-to-node=\"3,0\" data-index-in-node=\"0\">Note:</b> I’m mindful of the heavy human and political weight of current events, but for the purpose of this piece, I’m keeping the focus strictly on the market side of things. The goal here is to provide a clear-eyed look at the economic impacts, independent of the broader headlines.</em></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Initial Strike </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The initial strike's occurrence in Iran during daylight hours was surprising. This might have been due to strategic plans, as some reports suggest that Israel knew that some Iranian leadership was gathered at one location. It also occurred just shortly after <a href=\"https://apnews.com/live/us-iran-geneva-nuclear-talks-updates-2-26-2026\" rel=\"nofollow\">negotiation talks</a> with Iran took place in Geneva. All of this might have caught Iran's regime off guard in terms of the timing of a potential attack. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tomahawk missiles, which are made by RTX Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTX\" title=\"RTX Corporation\">RTX</a>), appear to have been used extensively in this initial wave, and some of the other targets in Iran reportedly included the locations of the Ministry of Intelligence, the Ministry of Defense, and the Presidential Institution. It is also said to have targeted senior Iranian leadership, including high-ranking political officials and military commanders. Nuclear-sensitive sites such as the Atomic Energy Organization headquarters in Tehran and military complexes and facilities in Isfahan and Qom were also targeted. Iran's missile industry near Tabriz and multiple launch sites across Iran were also targeted. The Iranian Navy and air defense systems were also struck by Operation Epic Fury.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_Iran_US_Airstrikes-inArticle_620.png?io=w640\" alt=\"map\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1240\" height=\"1174\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_Iran_US_Airstrikes-inArticle_620.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_Iran_US_Airstrikes-inArticle_620.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_Iran_US_Airstrikes-inArticle_620.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_Iran_US_Airstrikes-inArticle_620.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_Iran_US_Airstrikes-inArticle_620.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_Iran_US_Airstrikes-inArticle_620.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>theguardian.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Iran Retaliates </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Iran launched retaliatory attacks using drones and missiles against Israel and U.S. bases in the Middle East. It is not surprising to see that Iran has launched an attack on Israel and sirens have been blaring in Tel Aviv; however, Israel's strong missile defenses appear to be taking down most of the incoming projectiles, and for now it seems that only very limited damage has been sustained. It's worth noting that even though Saudi Arabia did not allow the U.S. to use bases in that country for Operation Epic Fury, Iran has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/02/arab-states-are-choosing-sides/686195/\" rel=\"nofollow\">launched attacks</a> on this and other Arab nations. This could be a major miscalculation on the part of Iran, because Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries might retaliate for this aggression. I see Iran's attacks on Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, and Kuwait as a sign of desperation—potentially the final acts of a regime that has little to lose because it knows its days are likely numbered.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Initial Reaction From Financial Markets </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even though most financial markets were closed for the weekend, there were some hints of a risk-off reaction from Bitcoin, which initially plunged after the attacks were launched. However, Bitcoin has recovered almost all of its losses and is nearly unchanged. Futures for gold and the U.S. Dollar also were impacted initially as potential safe haven assets; however, I believe that if Iran is unable to show more of a military response, the response could be muted by the time the stock market opens next week.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">An Energy Shock? </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Oil prices will be a key concern. The major risk is if Iran <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-gas-majors-traders-suspend-shipments-via-hormuz-us-attacks-iran-sources-say-2026-02-28/\" rel=\"nofollow\">attempts to partially or completely close</a> the Strait of Hormuz, through which about 20% of the world's oil passes. Some analysts suggest that a sustained blockade of this key waterway could cause <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78n6p09pzno\" rel=\"nofollow\">oil prices to surge</a> towards $120 to $150 per barrel. However, it seems unlikely that Iran could close this waterway for long, if at all. Doing so would devastate its own economy because it could no longer ship oil out, thereby forfeiting a major revenue source for the Iranian regime. Many other countries, including Iranian allies like China, are said to also oppose the closure of this waterway for their own economic reasons.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-177230868367674_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"3197\" data-height=\"942\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-177230868367674_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"189\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-177230868367674_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-177230868367674_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-177230868367674_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-177230868367674_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Vortexa</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Kharg Island handles roughly <a href=\"https://www.lloydslist.com/LL1156475/Maritime-warning-zone-in-place-as-US-and-Israel-launch-massive-strikes-on-Iran\" rel=\"noopener\">90% of Iran's crude oil exports</a>, making this another key concern. An attack on or blockade of Kharg Island could push up oil prices. The biggest potential risks for financial markets are a surge in oil prices due to the closure of the Strait of Hormuz or damage to oil facilities on Kharg Island. There are <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/if-trump-strikes-iran-mapping-oil-disruption-scenarios#:~:text=In%20this%20scenario%2C%20air%20and,reaches%20Kharg%20via%20subsea%20pipelines\" rel=\"nofollow\">reports</a> that the U.S. or Israel could attempt to seize control of Kharg Island to choke off Iran's primary source of oil revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk factor to consider is whether Iran attacks oil facilities in neighboring countries. This could have significant implications for oil prices and the financial markets. It also remains to be seen if Iranian allies like Hezbollah will enter this war in a major way.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stock Market Implications </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Major stock market indexes plunged on Friday, February 27th, due to AI disruption concerns and a hotter-than-expected <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558574-sp500-nasdaq-dow-jones-outlook-stock-market\">inflation report</a>. I would also add that the U.S. military buildup that occurred in the Middle East over the past several weeks made it clear that an attack on Iran could come soon, especially since the recent negotiations in Geneva concluded without any immediate solutions. This suggests that the stock market may have already priced in some type of military action, and many expected it could come this weekend since the U.S. military buildup appeared complete. The fear of an imminent attack may have also contributed to stock market losses on Friday.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the oil market remains stable over this weekend because none of the worst-case scenarios, such as a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, occur, I believe the stock market could react positively to Operation Epic Fury, even though this is in contrast to some of the more fearful posts I see on social media. As shown below, the market has been stuck in a trading range; therefore, better-than-feared news regarding Iran could spark a relief rally in the coming days.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-17723088756099145_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"990\" data-height=\"817\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-17723088756099145_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"528\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-17723088756099145_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-17723088756099145_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-17723088756099145_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/902464-17723088756099145_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>StockCharts.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here's My Strategy </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Iran's initial response appears weak. If the regime collapses and the Iranian people take control of the government, this could be a very positive event for many financial assets. It is still early, and a lot could still happen. I believe the key for investors is if oil supplies remain stable. If this occurs, I do not expect a big negative reaction from the stock market, and instead I anticipate a potential relief rally. If oil prices surge due to attacks on Middle Eastern energy facilities or if the Strait of Hormuz is closed, the market could plunge. I would use this as a buying opportunity in many stocks. Airlines, cruise lines, and transportation stocks could be among the hardest-hit sectors. I would buy weakness on any major pullbacks in these sectors. I would also consider buying the recent weakness in stocks like Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) and Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>).</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Summary </h3> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a lot going on, and this is not over, but the initial results of this strike on Iran do not suggest a worst-case scenario for oil prices or the financial markets. I would watch Bitcoin prices over the weekend as a proxy for risk assets and then futures on Sunday night to prepare for what might come for investors next week. As things stand now, I expect a relief rally for stocks, but this could change if matters escalate. However, I would use any sharp market pullback as a potential buying opportunity.</p>",

In this report, I discuss how this may affect the global markets with attention to energy, freight and logistics, airlines, crypto, aerospace, and defense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Note: War often comes with an unmeasurable amount of human tragedy and a fair bit of geopolitics. While I am cognizant of these factors, this report does not intend to discuss either the human tragedy or the politics behind the most recent combat action but aims to provide qualitative analysis of its impacts on markets, crypto(currencies), and commodities.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Strikes In Iran Hardly Come As A Surprise</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, the strikes hardly come as a surprise, as President Trump previously already <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/13/politics/us-iran-aircraft-carrier\" rel=\"nofollow\">communicated</a> that he had the USS Gerald R. Ford in the region. It is the second aircraft carrier that has been deployed to the Middle East along with its strike group. The carrier arrived at the Israeli coast yesterday. So, the fact that strikes occurred today is not surprising. We also note that in the weeks prior, a large movement of fighter jets, military cargo airplanes, civil cargo airplanes, and tankers occurred. These airplanes were initially placed in Sofia (Bulgaria) and Crete. I live roughly 300 km away from Sofia in Bucharest and already noticed increased military flight activity over the past days. From my time living in Sibiu (the NATO Headquarters Multinational Corps Southeast) and the war in Ukraine, I also know that increased military flight activity usually is a prelude to an attack.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The strikes currently are relatively contained. Iran has responded with targeting assets in countries in the Middle East, but for the time being we are not seeing a full-blown air or ground attack.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk Off Mode To Hurt Equities And Crypto</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Markets already have been in a relatively strong risk-off mode, but my expectation is that this will intensify. Higher risk assets such as cryptocurrencies will be under pressure. At the time of writing, Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD\" title=\"Bitcoin USD\">BTC-USD</a>) has fallen 1.7%, but we note that following the attack, Bitcoin prices had fallen as much as 3.5%. Year-to-date, Bitcoin is down more than 25%, so the attacks in Iran are likely to pressure sentiment further. Ethereum (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ETH-USD\" title=\"Ethereum USD\">ETH-USD</a>) has fallen in line with Bitcoin. So, overall, among the two major cryptocurrencies, we see a modestly lower price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Generally, equity markets (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 ETF\">QQQ</a></span>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" class=\"ticker-link\">SP500</a>, <span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a></span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>, <span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI\" title=\"Dow Jones Industrial Average Index\">DJI</a></span>) are expected also to be under pressure as investors process the attacks that already happened and weigh the uncertainty ahead, as we are not seeing a full blown escalation yet. For equity markets, the picture is not necessarily fully negative or positive. The initial reaction will more than likely be negative, but from there the technical picture (holding key support levels) is going to matter as well as how the conflict evolves. If a response from Iran is in some way unmeasured or escalatory, then we will see an acceleration in the rotation out of stocks towards safer assets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Oil Companies Set To Benefit</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Oil companies such as Exxon Mobil (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>) and Chevron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX\" title=\"Chevron Corporation\">CVX</a>) are likely set to benefit as oil prices head higher, and even in the short term, some money may flow into oil related equities driven by sentiment. Companies that are not set to benefit are midstream companies, which derive most of their income from commodity-neutral pricing schemes. We do note that demand for oil remains weak. So, the fluctuations in oil prices and the benefit that oil companies can derive from that are largely going to depend on the ability of oil shippers to supply. A more long-lived opportunity would present itself for higher oil prices and stock prices for oil companies if critical oil production and transportation infrastructure were being destroyed. However, we also note that an escalation could affect demand for oil due to weaker macroeconomic growth, and many countries can actually produce more barrels than they are currently doing. So, it would take a large scale evaporation of oil production and transportation capability to spark a major imbalance between supply and demand.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Freight And Logistics: A Mixed Picture</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019530924368_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1670\" data-height=\"1246\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019530924368_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"This image shows the Strait of Hormuz traffic\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019530924368_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019530924368_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019530924368_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019530924368_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Marine Traffic</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For freight and logistics companies, the picture is overall a mixed one. Oil tanker companies are likely set to benefit. The reason is that a closure of the strait does not reduce demand for oil, but it does mean many tankers will be locked in their place in the Persian Gulf. The Fujairah pipeline in the UAE and the East-West Crude Oil Pipeline connecting the Saudi eastern oil fields to the Red Sea port have limited capacity. Combined, these pipelines could process just 34% of the flow of barrels through the Strait of Hormuz. So, we are likely going to see some spike in oil transportation rates. War risk insurance premiums are likely going to increase, but that also drives shippers to not enter the strait and explore other opportunities that drive longer voyages, creating a higher ton-mile effect. Putting it simply, the usable fleet shrinks as fear makes shipping scarce, while effective capacity is being reduced through longer voyages as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For general trade, we note there is only a positive effect if there is a spillover of the conflict to other key routes such as the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, or Bab-el-Mandeb. These are key to the access to the Suez Canal. If the Suez Canal is inaccessible, it means longer voyages are required, meaning that effective capacity is lowered and freight rates increase. Absent a conflict spillover, the global cargo shippers are going to see just the higher cost effect of oil as a fuel. This indirectly increases shipping rates to pass through higher operational costs but also may result in route optimization, network redesign, and slow steaming to save fuel. All of these could disrupt existing global trade routes and capacity and increase rates.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Airlines Do Not Do Well On Geopolitical Tension And War</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301952483686_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1386\" data-height=\"1039\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301952483686_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"This image shows an Emirates A380 airplane.\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301952483686_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301952483686_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301952483686_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301952483686_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Emirates</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Airlines are the clear loser in this. Airline stocks are volatile and react to disruptions fast. At the time of writing, the airports of Doha, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi are among the airports that are closed. United Airlines (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UAL\" title=\"United Airlines Holdings, Inc.\">UAL</a>) and American Airlines (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAL\" title=\"American Airlines Group Inc.\">AAL</a>), with European airlines such as Lufthansa (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DLAKF\" title=\"Deutsche Lufthansa AG\">DLAKF</a>), Air France-KLM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AFRAF\" title=\"Air France-KLM SA\">AFRAF</a>), and British Airways (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ICAGY\" title=\"International Consolidated Airlines Group S.A.\">ICAGY</a>) are no longer flying to the Middle East. It creates missed revenues, and recalibrating capacity may weaken unit revenues in other markets. So, there is an immediate cost and revenue effect that is likely modest, but the longer this takes, the more the missed revenues and profits compound and the higher the risk that airlines will have to deploy capacity elsewhere and weaken fare prices in those markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cargo freight rates may increase as airlines avoid the Middle East, and the same holds for passenger airlines, but the effect for passenger airlines is much less positive than it could be for cargo airlines.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aerospace and Defense Is The Clear Winner</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019523182354_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"800\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019523182354_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"This image shows fighter jets.\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019523182354_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019523182354_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019523182354_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019523182354_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>US Air Force</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The clear winner, more than likely in terms of sentiment, is aerospace and defense. When tension increases, aerospace and defense companies perform well. We are already seeing that there is an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4864573-the-1-2-trillion-aerospace-and-defense-supercycle\">aerospace and defense supercycle,</a> and while aerospace and defense companies are not going to be winning new contracts tomorrow, sentiment is likely to improve for investment in aerospace and defense, and the recent events support a prolonged elevation of defense budgets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the flight radar, there are tens and maybe hundreds of airplanes we do not see. However, we see an Airbus (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSF\" title=\"Airbus SE\">EADSF</a>) refueling airplane airborne as well as an Airbus tactical transport airplane. Furthermore, we see an MQ-9 Reaper airborne and a Boeing (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA\" title=\"The Boeing Company\">BA</a>) F-15 with its transponder turned on. Furthermore, I am aware of flight activity for the C-5, F-35 and F-22 built by Lockheed Martin (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT\" title=\"Lockheed Martin Corporation\">LMT</a>) and the E-3, P-8A, C-17A, KC-135 and KC-46A by Boeing. So, Boeing and Lockheed Martin provide a lot of air power.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, there are strike carrier groups for the Abraham Lincoln and Gerald R Ford aircraft carriers built by Huntington Ingalls Industries (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HII\" title=\"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.\">HII</a>) consisting of the guided-missile destroyers of the Arleigh Burke class built by HII and General Dynamics and littoral combat ships built by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875203-austal-upgraded-to-strong-buy-on-defense-re-rating\">Austal</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AUTLF\" title=\"Austal Limited\">AUTLF</a>) and Fincantieri (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FNCNF\" title=\"Fincantieri S.p.A.\">FNCNF</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On those ships, there likely will be F-35 and F/A-18 fighter jets, helicopters and tactical aircraft and ships and aircraft will be equipped with missiles. Stitching all of that together is a layer of intelligence equipment. So, we are looking at a broad-based deployment from ships, fighter jets, helicopters, intelligence airplanes, tankers, missiles, missile defense and radars. It makes it a broad-based deployment of US made equipment, which I believe will draw investor attention. Another company that likely will see positive attention is Elbit Systems. Elbit is an Israeli company and given that Israel is involved in the combat action I do expect it to be one of the stocks in focus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, while there will not be any fundamental support for higher stock prices for aerospace and defense companies we will likely see improved sentiment and support for higher defense budgets over the longer-term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Commodity Prices: Oil Shock And Gold As Safe Haven</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301953531684_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2000\" data-height=\"1467\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301953531684_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"This image shows an oil production facility in Saudi Arabia.\" width=\"640\" height=\"469\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301953531684_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301953531684_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301953531684_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-1772301953531684_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ARAMCO</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For commodity prices, the expectation is that those will increase. Given the importance of the Middle East for oil production, oil is likely to spike. We already note that Brent Futures (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CO1:COM\" class=\"ticker-link\">CO1:COM</a>) are up 2.9%. So, we are looking at the Strait of Hormuz effect as this is a crucial waterway for global oil trade. The narrow passage between Iran and Oman is set to become the literal bottleneck for global oil trade. Daily, around 20-21 million barrels pass through this strait, and it is highly likely that there will be disruptions. We are already seeing <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-gas-majors-traders-suspend-shipments-via-hormuz-us-attacks-iran-sources-say-2026-02-28\" rel=\"nofollow\">reports</a> of oil and gas majors and traders suspending shipments via Hormuz. So, oil and gas will head up, and a further escalation of the conflict or a prolonged war would further increase those prices limited by development of demand in the macroeconomic picture.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the risk off sentiment is likely to intensify, we will see a spike in gold prices. So, Gold is once again going to fulfill its role of safe haven, attracting liquidity exiting the equity and cryptocurrency markets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">USD Likely To Strengthen</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As investors liquidate positions and we note that buying safe-haven assets and oil is usually dollar-denominated, we are likely going to see the USD strengthen. Quite often we see that investors view the power position that the US has as a favor that is being done to the world. That is, however, not fully the case. The power projection, both politically and militarily, also serves as a strengthening mechanism for the US Dollar and I believe we will see this in play as well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overview Of Impacts Of Combat Action In Iran</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ideally, we would be able to provide a playbook on which parts of the markets will win and which ones will lose. The reality, however, is that there currently is a lot of uncertainty. We do not know whether military actions have been successful and the duration of military action and responses. So, the duration and military impact and consequences for the region and world are not known at this point in time. So, we are only able to map, the near-term expected impacts. I have done that in the diagram below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019520301332_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"719\" data-height=\"1069\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019520301332_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"This image shows how military action may affect asset classes\" width=\"640\" height=\"952\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019520301332_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019520301332_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019520301332_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/9932311-17723019520301332_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Aerospace Forum</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What we see is that military action brings several axes along sentiment and rotation of funds can take place. These axes are:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Disruption in logistics affecting flights and shipping capacity</li> <li>Higher oil prices</li> <li>Risk sentiment recalibration</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Higher oil prices are beneficial for oil companies and there likely will also be some risk-on sentiment for oil and gas companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk sentiment recalibration currently is expected to drive the majority of the market movements. Risk off sentiment will negatively affect cryptocurrencies, equity markets and airlines while USD and Gold are likely to strengthen. Risk-on sentiment for now is likely only expected to strongly benefit aerospace and defense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Disruptions due to air space closures are a negative for airlines while the combination of limited shipping capacity available and war risk premiums will benefit oil shippers. Global maritime has a mixed set of inputs. Rerouting and conflict spillover would limit available shipping capacity, which is a positive. However, higher oil prices drive up operational costs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: First Reaction Is Sentiment Drive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The first reaction in the markets will be driven by risk sentiment calibration. For the equity market, the extent of declines is going to be determined by holding key technical support levels. Beyond that, the duration and effect of the military action are going to become increasingly more dominant to give the market direction.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Inc.\">KKR</a>). As such, it lends primarily to private equity-sponsored middle market companies through a diversified set of investments, most of which are senior secured loans that earn it contractual senior-in-the-capital-stack investments, senior-in-the-capital-stack cash flows via interest payments, and then it returns the vast majority of those to shareholders via dividends after taking off management's cut via base management and performance incentive fees. In turn, it provides what should be professional underwriting expertise and active management of its loan portfolio to try to generate outsized risk-adjusted returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The portfolio is pretty well diversified across 232 companies, with its top 10 positions taking up about 19.4% of fair value. Additionally, about 62% of its investments are senior secured, with about 57.8% of these being in first-lien loans, but it also invests in asset-backed loans and joint ventures, as well as some equity investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722458005181978_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1215\" data-height=\"584\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722458005181978_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FSK\" width=\"640\" height=\"308\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"308\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722458005181978_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722458005181978_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722458005181978_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722458005181978_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the company's performance has been quite poor, with a large number of its investments falling into the non-income-producing category, making up about 9.5% of the portfolio, while non-accruals are also rising, reaching 5.5% at cost and 3.4% at fair value as of the end of the quarter, despite significant write-downs in previous quarters that had brought down the non-accruals as a percentage of the overall portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest reason for concern is that the company's NAV per share has consistently declined over time, and this past quarter was perhaps the most jarring example of this so far, as it lost $0.87 per share from investment markdowns, and the remaining decline was due to it over-distributing net investment income via its dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722459226569912_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1195\" data-height=\"610\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722459226569912_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FSK\" width=\"640\" height=\"327\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"327\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722459226569912_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722459226569912_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722459226569912_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722459226569912_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This inability to sustain the principal for investors is a huge blight on the investment, as BDCs attract income investors who understand that the vast majority of their return is going to come from the dividend. However, they do not want the dividend to be undermined by the NAV per share declining at a rapid rate, as it effectively makes it a shrinking ice cube rather than a sustainable, long-term passive income vehicle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_56788440c3edb10d1d0f06063914d378.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_56788440c3edb10d1d0f06063914d378.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_56788440c3edb10d1d0f06063914d378.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_56788440c3edb10d1d0f06063914d378.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's even worse is the fact that FSK, as an externally managed BDC, has questionable alignment with shareholders. While there are plenty of externally managed BDCs out there, including Ares Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARCC\" title=\"Ares Capital\">ARCC</a>) (by Ares Management (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARES\" title=\"Ares Management Corporation\">ARES</a>)) and Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BXSL\" title=\"Blackstone Secured Lending Fund.\">BXSL</a>) (by Blackstone (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BX\" title=\"Blackstone Inc.\">BX</a>)), both of which have done pretty well by shareholders and thus have earned their trust, FSK appears to be a case where management is purely milking the BDC for fees.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Buyback Question That Won’t Go Away</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the purest examples of this is how management allocates capital whenever the BDC is trading at a material discount to NAV. In BXSL's case, they have bought back stock fairly substantially whenever it has traded at a discount to NAV. And you see this with other externally-managed BDCs, including most recently Blue Owl Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OBDC\" title=\"Blue Owl Capital Corporation\">OBDC</a>), which <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875806-12-percent-yield-trading-for-pennies-on-the-dollar-blue-owl-capital\">bought back stock aggressively</a> last quarter when it traded down to a significant discount to NAV. Meanwhile, FSK has bought back stock in the past, but now that its discount to NAV has widened, analysts pressed management on the earnings call quite aggressively about what their thoughts were for buybacks. Below is an excerpt from the earnings call where this Q&amp;A took place:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Casey Alexander</strong><em>Compass Point Research &amp; Trading, LLC, Research Division</em></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>I have one question and one follow-up. My first question is, look, I hate to bring up what might seem like a tired old refrain. But at the moment, the stock is trading at 55% of book, and that kind of screams not to invest in new loans, but to take repayments and start buying the stock.</p> <p>Could you guys give us some feeling for your temper in regards to beginning to initiate meaningful stock repurchases? And I know -- look, I know the employees have bought the stock. I know the advisers bought the stock. But at this point in time, your only road to increasing NAV at this point in time is accretive share repurchases at such a dramatic discount to book value.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel Pietrzak</strong><em>President, Chief Investment Officer &amp; Director</em></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>Yes. Casey, thanks for the question. I think we understand the point there. I think as the entity, these numbers might not be perfect, but I think we have historically bought back $350 million of stock. That's probably more than sort of most out there. It is something that we do have to consider. I think the only thing on the other side of that, that I just need to be mindful about is the market noise and/or volatility.</p> <p>And I do believe some of that is overdone out there broadly, but that's kind of top of mind and then where we're at vis-a-vis sort of leverage and target leverage. But it is, yes, something that we will be talking about.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Casey Alexander</strong><em>Compass Point Research &amp; Trading, LLC, Research Division</em></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Yes. And the fact that maybe some of the movement in the stock is related to broader market noise would argue even more, I would think, to buying it here because some of that will then be relieved by the absence of the market noise, and this would be the most accretive level.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then later on in the earnings call:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Richard Shane</strong><em>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Research Division</em></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>Look, Casey really covered, I think, as far as I'm concerned, the most important structural issue in terms of repurchasing shares. Look, you guys had over $5 billion come in last year, $5 billion the year before that. Presumably, the run rate in terms of repayments will be similar this year, which should provide a fair amount of liquidity for repurchases.</p> <p>I haven't -- listening to all the BDC calls, I haven't heard anybody make a super compelling case for, wow, there's this incredible dislocation, this opportunity to deploy capital into new loans that's so attractive. What is out there that's actually more accretive to both earnings and again, to NAV than repurchasing shares at this point?</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel Pietrzak</strong><em>President, Chief Investment Officer &amp; Director</em></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>Yes. And thanks for the question, Rick. I think the investing environment has been -- maybe the right word is interesting over the last handful of years, right? There's been a lot of different forms of market events to the market. I think on the direct lending side, to be fair, has felt decently tight in terms of -- you have seen spread compression. I think a lot of that has had to do with the fact of inflows were high.</p> <p>I do think the inflows from the wealth channel was a driver of that, and that was really coupled with, let's call it, lower-than-normal M&amp;A volume. So you can talk about a little bit of a market technical out there. I think the offset to that is, I think the quality of the companies that have been accessing the market has been strong. I think the size of the companies that have been accessing the market has been good.</p> <p>I think we prefer to lend to those larger companies. I think the thing we have tried to focus on is getting diversification in the book, right? So that was growing the joint venture was one form of that. We got up to the target number. We have seen some compelling opportunities in the asset-based finance. We talked about some of those on prior deals -- I'm sorry, prior calls, either the Harley-Davidson or the PayPal.</p> <p>But I understand the point. I think we need to take all that into consideration as we move forward. I would say one thing. I probably am expecting a more lender-friendly environment as we go through the course of '26. I think that will very much skew based upon how open the capital markets is, which it is pretty open right now. But I think you'll see the flows maybe sort of temper a bit, and then you'll have to see what happens in the capital markets as the sort of probably primary driver of that. But our eyes are focused on it.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What was so jarring was management's completely noncommittal take on buybacks. A quality manager, for example, OBDC, would not just talk about buying back stock. It would show how it was actively buying back stock and how it would have a plan in place to do so. FSK did none of this and simply said that they are going to have to think about it, while also hedging by saying that they do expect a more attractive lending environment moving forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This strikes us as very revealing, given that spreads in the sector have actually been tightening significantly over the past year, so new loans are generally offering much lower yields than the ones that are being repaid right now. Thus, if management were at all concerned about shareholder value rather than maximizing the fees they earn from assets under management, they would be buying back stock aggressively with the proceeds from repaid loans, as well as any excess retained net investment income after they just slashed their dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This would not only show good faith to investors but also help to stabilize and potentially even increase NAV per share, given that at these prices, they could literally be buying a dollar of NAV for ~$0.50. Given the mid- to high-teens dividend yield on the current stock price and even higher NII per share yield on the current stock price, it is virtually impossible to imagine them finding a better place to invest that money right now than in buying back their own stock. Thus, their unwillingness to do so speaks either to a management team that appears to be heavily conflicted between maximizing fees for the sponsor and protecting shareholder value, or a management team that has little confidence that their stock is actually worth close to what they are marking its NAV at.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Cut, Rising Risks, And A Troubling Signal</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the balance sheet remains in decent shape, with a net debt-to-equity ratio of 1.22x, which is within management's target range of 1.0x to 1.25x, and is also in line with many of their peers. The company also had plenty of liquidity, with $3.8 billion worth of it at quarter's end. This is enough to earn them investment-grade credit ratings from Moody's, Fitch, and Kroll.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That being said, the company did have $1 billion worth of notes that came due in January of this year at just a 3.4% fixed interest rate, which means that their interest expense will be going up moving forward, starting in Q1, providing an additional drag to NII per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All of this means that their recent steep dividend cut is not surprising, especially in the wake of Federal Reserve rate cuts and FSK's weakening NAV per share. That being said, with a $0.45 per share base dividend plus a $0.03 per share supplemental dividend, their dividend yield today is still sky high, given how far their stock price has plunged, such that it trades at a near 50% discount to NAV. With a 16.7% annualized current base dividend and a 17.8% annualized base plus supplemental dividend yield, FSK's income yield is extremely attractive right now, especially if it can sustain that at least for a while. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, while management previously guided to a 10% dividend yield on NAV, the current 9% dividend yield on NAV also signals a lack of confidence from management into even the quality of its current NAV, which, along with the lack of commitment to buybacks, indicates to the market that there could be more weakness ahead beyond what the headline numbers are showing. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fee Structure Red Flags And A Prospect Capital Parallel</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet another strike against FSK's management, however, came on the earnings call when an analyst questioned them about their fee structure. This was quite telling because other externally-managed BDCs that have fallen on hard times recently have slashed their fee structure. For example, Oaktree Specialty Lending (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OCSL\" title=\"Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation\">OCSL</a>) and Goldman Sachs BDC (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GSBD\" title=\"Goldman Sachs BDC\">GSBD</a>) both reduced their fees due to underwriting weakness in their portfolios. Therefore, it was entirely reasonable for the analysts to ask FSK about considering doing the same thing. In fact, if you compare them to other externally managed BDCs, they are on the more expensive side, with a fee structure that is almost as expensive as ARCC's.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722291707218413_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"937\" data-height=\"424\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722291707218413_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FSK\" width=\"640\" height=\"290\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"290\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722291707218413_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722291707218413_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722291707218413_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47771937-17722291707218413_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GBDC Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, management simply said they are cognizant of that and are \"mapping to the market,\" and will discuss it amongst themselves, but made no commitment to a fee reduction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the precedent from other companies that have announced fee reductions in the same quarter that they released bombshell negative results, that would have probably been a prudent thing to do. And given that they didn't, it only furthered the impression to Mr. Market that FSK is in the business of milking fees from shareholders rather than actually trying to create long-term shareholder value. In this sense, it is reminding us increasingly of Prospect Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSEC\" title=\"Prospect Capital Corporation\">PSEC</a>), which has done something similar over the long term and in the process has proven to be a serial destroyer of shareholder value:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_478dbd5f17f7b308e0250bcfe2d0c859.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_478dbd5f17f7b308e0250bcfe2d0c859.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_478dbd5f17f7b308e0250bcfe2d0c859.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_478dbd5f17f7b308e0250bcfe2d0c859.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, it is not surprising at all to see FSK's P/NAV get cut in half over the past year, as the market has gone from viewing this BDC as a respectable fund that was trying to create value for shareholders to a perennial underperformer that is simply milking shareholders for fees:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_4903863c1ba8ba5563e987288f245fd3.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_4903863c1ba8ba5563e987288f245fd3.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_4903863c1ba8ba5563e987288f245fd3.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_4903863c1ba8ba5563e987288f245fd3.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Has To Change Before I Even Consider Buying</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With all that said, what is the forward outlook for the company? First and foremost, the company needs to find a way to stabilize its NAV per share, which includes both improved underwriting, positive workouts of existing issues, and, very importantly, buying back stock aggressively at these levels. However, it appears that investors should not be holding their breath for the latter, and we'll have to see in terms of underwriting performance, though the track record at FSK is not encouraging there either.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the flip side, the discount is so enormous, and the dividend yield is so huge, that FSK can still continue to have some underwriting issues and not buy back any stock, and still potentially, over the long term, deliver significant total returns. The biggest risk here, though, is that they will continue to have material credit performance deterioration. Given management's weak dividend yield per NAV relative to its previous guidance, as well as lack of commitment to buybacks, not to mention the broader concerns in the industry about the health of private credit, there is not a whole lot of positive takeaway or reason for optimism over the long term with FSK's credit performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, while the yield is huge and the discount to NAV is even more mouth-watering, I need to have a management team that I can fully get behind. They don't need to be the most brilliant minds or the shrewdest operators in the industry, but they, at the very least, need to convince me that they are looking out for shareholder interests rather than just milking the fund for fees. I've seen too many examples of externally managed funds, whether it be PSEC or the previously externally-managed Global Net Lease (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GNL\" title=\"Global Net Lease, Inc.\">GNL</a>) in the REIT (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VNQ\" title=\"Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund ETF\">VNQ</a>) sector, where they've looked extremely cheap only to continue letting shareholders down again and again, all while enriching management with high fees.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you want to buy a small position in FSK as a speculative play due to the incredibly deep discount and the high yield, given that the non-accruals are not that high and KKR is a fairly reputable manager and underwriter, I think there are definitely worse bets you can take right now. However, given that there are plenty of high-quality BDCs with credible management teams that have strong underlying fundamentals and are trading at large discounts right now, I am not going to buy FSK for now and instead will keep it on my watch list.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If I see management in the next quarter buying back stock, considering a fee reduction, and/or improving its underwriting performance, and thereby proving to me that they are actually looking out for shareholders, I will seriously consider buying it, especially if it continues to trade at a steep discount to NAV. In the meantime, I will continue to focus on the higher-quality yet still undervalued segment of the BDC sector in my 7-8% yielding, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/47771937-samuel-smith/6260780-our-portfolio-track-record-results-through-february-14-2026\">total return outperforming</a>, and below-market beta portfolios at <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1369-high-yield-investor\">High Yield Investor</a>.</p>",

Everyone wants to invest in the concept of cellular broadband from space, but the company’s recent history has not exactly been the kind that allows you<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to sleep at night. Over the past two years, the company has had more earnings misses than earnings beats and revenue has also missed more often than it has not. Again, not a moral statement, just the facts of life when you’re building something massive before it starts paying you back.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851740-ast-spacemobile-big-promise-big-pressure\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851740-ast-spacemobile-big-promise-big-pressure\" target=\"_blank\">last coverage</a> ASTS is up 8.8% and now the difference in Q4 is that the company has already told the market that Q3 2025 is when the commercialization machine really started to move, with GAAP revenue of $14.7 million primarily related to gateway hardware sales and US government milestones. Q4 is where the market will be looking to see that the revenue growth is not just an anomaly but the beginning of a repeatable process.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Actually Matters in Q4: Revenue, Not EPS</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The expectations for Q4 earnings seem to be quite straightforward at first blush. Revenue is expected to be <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASTS/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASTS/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly\" target=\"_blank\">$41.55 million</a>, a significant step up from the $14.7 million reported in the prior quarter. The loss is expected to be approximately $0.20 GAAP, so the Street is not expecting the company to make money, but they are expecting to see some progress that feels meaningful.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659876679645_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"882\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659876679645_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ASTS\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"276\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659876679645_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659876679645_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659876679645_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659876679645_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>seekingalpha.com</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the last eight quarters, the company has beaten on EPS <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASTS/earnings/eps-surprise-summary?period=quarterly\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASTS/earnings/eps-surprise-summary?period=quarterly\" target=\"_blank\">only two times out of six misses</a> and no in-line quarters. Revenues also failed to deliver for the company, with five misses, two beats, and one in-line result. Interestingly, the company missed its EPS by $0.90 in Q3 2024 and by $0.33 in Q2 2025.

They talked about the over $1 billion in aggregate contracted revenue commitments from commercial partners and they directly related that to the Verizon and stc announcements. If that $1 billion is meaningful, not just in the press release but in the actual business, then Q4 should show further progress in revenue, more activity in the gateway and more discussion about the service activation pipeline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The least appreciated aspect in my view, is that the company is being valued on its credibility at the present time, not its margins, not its EBITDA, but its credibility. A quarter that continues to prove out the revenue story can quickly move the stock but another quarter that is messy will put the company back in the penalty box.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Commercial Engine: Partners, Prepayments, and a Bigger Proof Signal</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The partners and the prepayments and the credibility that the company is building, is the most important aspect of the thesis for me. They talked about an ecosystem of <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/258/118258/original.pdf\" title=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/258/118258/original.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">50-plus</a> mobile network operators that reach over three billion subscribers across the globe. That is the distribution layer that most space startups will never even see in their business lives, and that is why they can so comfortably say that they are not creating a new consumption paradigm but actually an extension of the existing economics that exists in the telecom world.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659880031307_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1838\" data-height=\"1012\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659880031307_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ASTS\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"352\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659880031307_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659880031307_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659880031307_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659880031307_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Q3 Update</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Two recent commercial-related announcements that I think will be important going into Q4 include the recent announcement related to the stc deal, where they talked about a 10-year term deal that included a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4841604-ast-spacemobile-inc-asts-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4841604-ast-spacemobile-inc-asts-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">$175 million</a> prepayment for services and the more recent announcement related to the Verizon deal, where they talked about the opportunity to actually provide direct-to-device cellular broadband services starting in 2026, leveraging the strategic partnership that they had previously announced. Those aren’t memorandums but actual business deals where the capital and the time actually start to matter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, here’s the Q4 question I’ll be looking for an answer to with ASTS. Does it sound like a company that is signing deals, or does it sound like a company that is converting those deals into operational milestones?</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">From Rocket Factory to Revenue Engine</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ASTS is not a software company, it is a manufacturing and launch schedule with a telecom dream. They went through great pains to say that BlueBird 8 through BlueBird 19 were already in production, and that they were expecting to complete the assembly of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4841604-ast-spacemobile-inc-asts-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4841604-ast-spacemobile-inc-asts-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">40 satellites</a> equivalent of microns by early 2026. They went through great pains to say that they were confident that they could achieve five orbital launches by the end of Q1 2026 with launches occurring every one to two months, with 45 to 60 satellites by the end of 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That is when the transition happens from cool demos to commercial service. ASTS went through great pains to say that initial activation of service in key markets would be nationwide intermittent service across the continental US, with planned activations in Canada, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and the UK in early 2026. What I like about ASTS is that they’re giving investors checkpoints. What I don’t like is that I know that space timelines tend to slip for reasons that are completely outside of management’s control. Q4 commentary will be almost as important as the actual numbers.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659878053753_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1838\" data-height=\"712\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659878053753_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ASTS\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"248\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659878053753_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659878053753_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659878053753_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659878053753_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Q3 Update</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Financial Reality: The Balance Sheet Is Strong But the Burn Is Still the Burn</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors now have a good reason to support the bull case for ASTS with its improved financial position. Management indicated that the company has more than $3.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and liquidity on a pro forma basis as of September 30, 2025. It is now giving the company the right to play this game seriously, and it is no longer existential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That being said, there’s no denying that the company’s spending rate isn’t trivial. Q3 capital expenditures were $258.9 million, down from <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/258/118258/original.pdf\" title=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/258/118258/original.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">$322.8 million</a> in Q2. Adjusted operating expenses were $67.7 million in Q3 versus $51.7 million in Q2. Management also reiterated that the company’s average capital costs will be around $21 million to $23 million per satellite when including direct materials and launch costs.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659877883751_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1328\" data-height=\"898\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659877883751_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ASTS\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"433\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659877883751_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659877883751_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659877883751_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49853134-17722659877883751_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Q3 Updae</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, the lens to look at Q4 performance through is simple, will the company continue to manage their spending discipline while accelerating satellite launches? If CapEx goes up to the range that’s associated with launch payments, that’s not necessarily bad. It’s bad if the company executes poorly and buys time with money.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks That Can Break the Thesis Quickly</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The obvious risk is execution risk. ASTS is akin to threading a needle when it comes to manufacturing timelines, launch timelines, partner integration, and regulatory timelines. One slip in any of those is survivable. Two or three slips change the discussion from 'building' to 'stuck,' and markets do not tolerate that nuance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk factor relates to revenue. The fact that revenue comes in early means that the revenue could be lumpy. Gateway sales and government revenue based on milestones could mean that the revenue could be volatile. Even if the trend is positive in the long term, volatility could be painful for the stock. This could be painful for a stock whose earnings surprises have been mixed in the past.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The earnings announcement for this company is not about beating or missing estimates. It is about believability. If ASTS can show that it indeed has revenue momentum towards the expected $41.6 million and can reinforce its early 2026 activation story in detail, then the stock will be rewarded quickly. If the company has another soft-edged revenue announcement, then the stock will be forgotten as a promise rather than a reality.</p>",

While this is relatively low given the size of the loan book, this took the market by surprise, and the share price moved down. But despite this loan loss provision, the pre-tax income came in at $60.5M, resulting in a net profit of just under $48M. Federal Agricultural Mortgage required $7.3M to cover the preferred dividends, resulting in a net profit of $40.6M attributable to the common shareholders of AGM, representing an</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4554849-farmer-mac-anticipates-robust-2026-loan-growth-as-business-volume-reaches-33_4b-amid-capital\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4554849-farmer-mac-anticipates-robust-2026-loan-growth-as-business-volume-reaches-33_4b-amid-capital\" target=\"_blank\"> <span>EPS of $3.73</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Taking a step back and looking at the full-year results, AGM reported a total EPS of $16.73, which is a small increase compared to the preceding year. And this includes the impact of almost $33M in loan loss provisions vs. less than $12M recorded in FY 2024. And from the perspective of a preferred shareholder, I’m of course very satisfied seeing AGM needed just around 12% of its net income to cover the preferred dividends.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>In the previous article, I was quite happy to see AGM had less than $225M in loans past due and non-accruing loans on a total loan book of almost $15B. I also argued that due to the low LTV ratio, the bank should be able to avoid high haircuts if a loan sours, as a substantial portion of the loans are backed by collateral. This doesn’t mean there will be no charge-offs, but I am still expecting the potential haircuts to be relatively limited.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>And it goes without saying that the vast majority of the loan portfolio remains in good standing.

After what I thought was an impressive earnings release that could hold its own among the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> best of beat and raise results for the last quarter, the market still isn't elated?

That does not imply that the beneficiaries of the AI infrastructure buildout are exclusively on Jensen Huang’s team. Of course not. Technology investors should be well aware that the market has rotated across to the other companies involved in the value chain. And this includes opportunities in the utilities, industrials, energy, infrastructure companies. They are now riding an incredible secular wave known mostly to technology and growth investors in the past, arguably. However, in the era of AI disruptive forces, the market is rewiring how it is thinking about the ultimate winners and losers from this AI race.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-17722578929684258_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1867\" data-height=\"1066\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-17722578929684258_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nvidia Q4 updates\" width=\"640\" height=\"365\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-17722578929684258_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-17722578929684258_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-17722578929684258_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-17722578929684258_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Nvidia Q4 updates <span>(Nvidia)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, I find it perplexing for the market to sell off markedly after NVDA’s earnings release. As a matter of fact, the stock is now surfing closer to the levels that we saw in early February. Profit-taking appears to be the predominant sentiment surrounding NVDA right now. However, a closer introspection of the price action across the semiconductor industry shows that broad weakness has also manifested in its semi peers. In other words, I do not think that investors should be unduly perturbed about the current negative sentiment afflicting NVDA right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After all, how often do you find a company that is worth almost $4.5 trillion in market cap still being able to put out such incredible growth in revenue over the past year? Mind you, we are talking about a growth rate of more than 70% in Q4. It is an astonishing re-acceleration of growth from the July quarter’s 56%, and the 63% that the company notched for the October quarter. Obviously, the almost $700 billion in capital expenditure outlay that big tech companies have outlined is now flooding into Nvidia’s P&amp;L and mounting contractual backlog.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Which is why I thought the guidance was out of this world. And I was also flabbergasted at what the market was looking for, as Nvidia delivered an outlook that amounted to a 78% growth in revenue for the first quarter. That's an almost 80% increase, mind you. And we are talking about a company that posted more than $130 billion in revenue for fiscal 2025. And in the process minted more than $60 billion in free cash flow, equivalent to a margin of almost 47%. We are talking about a very high quality, immensely profitable, and dominant company among all its semiconductor peers right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But as always, we must respect the market’s wisdom. That isn't to say that we should simply accept what the market is printing over the course of just one week. Because unless you're trading on a very short time frame on NVDA, which I actually believe is unnecessary, we need to consider a longer-term approach when assessing the entry points, the trend bias, and also the overall sentiment that has underpinned its narrative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because, obviously, the market is looking at the next architectural transition for Nvidia. We already know that the company will be ramping up Vera Rubin from this year, even though I expect the older generations, such as Hopper, and Grace Blackwell, to still be the dominant ones and help the company to scale up profitably and maintain its high gross margins, which have actually surged to the 75% mark.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia: Still Scaling Blackwell Rapidly</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If anything, I believe it shows just how important and pivotal it is to demonstrate scale at the highest level. And if there's one company that has delivered the millions of GPUs while also seeing <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874926-nvidia-corporation-nvda-q4-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">nine gigawatts of Blackwell infrastructure</a> deployed across its customers, no one comes close. Moreover, the company has already moved past the snafu that threatened to scupper its tight partnership with OpenAI, as I explained in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4864706-nvidia-the-openai-deal-wobble-wont-break-its-ai-empire\">my previous Nvidia update</a>. Recall that the $100 billion LOI was thought to be at risk, although both companies appear ready to move on while also finalizing <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558700-openai-confirms-110b-funding-round-with-50b-from-amazon-and-30b-from-nvidia-softbank\">another $30 billion deal in the process.</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, when I look at the pessimism that is currently dominating the narrative, it seems to me that the market appears to be concerned about whether Amazon Web Services (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) is primed to make gains into <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-new-deals-mean-amazon-microsoft-nvidia?rc=3e6wgn\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nvidia’s much vaunted market share</a> in AI chips. The rejuvenated Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) has already answered the clarion call from its investors to show its ability to compete at the highest level. We know that not only has the company regained its competitiveness in delivering the most cutting edge AI models, it is now also ready to take on Nvidia in selling chips to customers, and most importantly, the hyperscalers. It is important for us not to forget that the top five hyperscalers account for over 50% of Nvidia’s revenue base. Therefore, the market could be really concerned this time, as Google’s ambitions could see it cream off some share of Nvidia's market. And with Google now having finalized the multi-billion TPU chip deal with Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), the wheels are finally set in motion, as the market worries about who is next, that could also join Meta in expanding these agreements:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-strikes-multibillion-dollar-ai-chip-deal-meta-sharpening-nvidia-rivalry?rc=3e6wgn\" rel=\"nofollow\">News of the Google-Meta deal</a> comes days after Nvidia announced a new deal with Meta, in which the Facebook owner said it will buy millions of GPUs for its data centers in the coming years. At the time, the Nvidia deal raised questions about the future of Google’s talks with Meta, which The Information reported last year, but it isn’t clear that it had any impact. Another factor in the Meta-TPU deal could be Meta’s own struggles to develop and AI training chip, details of which The Information reported earlier Thursday. Some leaders of the Google Cloud unit previously suggested internally that supercharging the TPU business could help the company grab as much as 10% of Nvidia’s annual revenue—around $200 billion in the past 12 months, according to a person who heard the remarks. - <em>The Information article on Google-Meta deal</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, OpenAI’s expanded arrangement with Amazon hasn't just threatened its partnership with Microsoft. Because we know that Microsoft has been known to be struggling with deploying its internal homemade chips widely. So at least in the foreseeable future, Microsoft will likely mostly rely on Nvidia, or even its neocloud partners, focusing on deploying NVDA’s chip infrastructure. That will largely keep Nvidia chips in its orbit for a while. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, that isn't necessarily the same case for AWS. In fact, based on the latest reports, it suggests that Amazon is pressing on to expand the use of its custom chips, the Trainium 3 &amp; 4, to feature more prominently in OpenAI’s business. AWS has also forged a closer arrangement with the Sam Altman company not only for customized models, but also for certain enterprise AI agent products, taking a step further in an attempt to sideline MSFT’s early investments, as Amazon filled the gap that Nvidia arguably left (as they scaled down significantly from the previous $100 billion LOI). Furthermore, Amazon's terms indicate that the world's largest hyperscaler isn't going to scale with Nvidia chips as the North Star this time around, as it possibly believes its current footprint in cloud computing has the necessary penetration and deployment capacity to compete with NVDA and also Google. In other words, I think Amazon is seizing the opportunity through OpenAI to convince the world that its custom chips are now ready for prime time, not just for its own workloads, but also potentially for external customers to lease and scale, similarly to what Google has achieved:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/amazon-openai-reach-50-billion-investment-agreement?rc=3e6wgn\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon confirmed it would invest up</a> to $50 billion in OpenAI, in two stages, as part of a broad agreement with the ChatGPT maker that will expand OpenAI’s existing $38 billion agreement to rent servers on Amazon’s cloud service AWS by $100 billion and will involve OpenAI using 2 gigawatts of Amazon’s Trainium AI chips through AWS. Amazon’s cloud service, AWS, also will be the “exclusive third party cloud distribution provider” for OpenAI’s new enterprise focused AI management service, OpenAI Frontier, the companies said. The details in the agreement were in line with what The Information has previously reported. That includes Amazon investing $15 billion by the end of March and another $35 billion “in the coming months when certain conditions are met.” A securities filing by Amazon said Amazon’s obligations to buy the extra shares was based on the earlier of OpenAI “meeting specified milestones” and OpenAI going public. The Information previously reported the specified milestones related to OpenAI achieving artificial general intelligence, generally defined as AI on a par with human abilities. But the formal contract, included in Amazon’s securities filing, doesn’t make clear what the milestones are. - <em>The Information article on Amazon-OpenAI arrangement</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And if you think about it, questions about whether Nvidia’s moat could weaken due to this interference by its customers/rivals, and whether these efforts could really help them make meaningful gains against its ecosystem, are arguably justified. After all, Nvidia’s 75% gross margins do offer much potential for the market to digest if they could make the CUDA moat worth a lot less, or easier to crack than it appears to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now please don't get me wrong. I am not alluding to the immediate possibility that Nvidia’s CUDA is prone to disruption, far from it. What I'm saying is that, there is tremendous motivation, and even more so now as the free cash flow margins for the hyperscalers and big technology companies have been crimped as they expend close to the $700 billion dollar mark this year in CapEx. Note that for Amazon, the largest hyperscaler in the world, we could even be looking at negative free cash flow margins this year. So something has to give, right? Something has to go down for these companies to continue investing so aggressively in AI. Either Nvidia gives up some of its prized margins to the value chain, or these companies are going to double down on the efforts to diversify their reliance on Jensen Huang for future generations of their AI chips:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/amazon-tries-its-low-cost-approach-to-winning-the-ai-race-97c6c338?mod=hp_lead_pos3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon’s new artificial intelligence czar</a>, Peter DeSantis, thinks the company can use it in the AI race, where it needs a win after falling far behind competitors in developing cutting-edge models and popular applications for consumers and businesses. “AI has a cost problem,” he said. “If we ultimately want AI to transform everything, the costs have to be different.” Amazon, he said, has the expertise and the infrastructure to achieve that. Under DeSantis, Amazon plans to use its in-house chips to develop AI models more cheaply than competitors. It’s betting on strong demand for enterprise AI products that make up for their lack of all-purpose power with task-specific customization. And it’s still hoping that the large language model technology that powers chatbots can supercharge its Alexa-branded smart home offerings. - <em>WSJ article on Amazon’s low-cost approach</em></p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia Always Have Tricks Up Its Sleeves</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259010209151_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1365\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259010209151_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Nvidia estimates\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259010209151_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259010209151_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259010209151_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259010209151_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Nvidia estimates <span>(TIKR)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Which is why I'm not surprised that analysts are looking for even more clarity beyond just the first quarter. And I guess that's where the bifurcation and disconnect is. The market doesn't want to see just Q1 guidance. Obviously we know that Vera Rubin is on track for production ramp. However, the previous problems with the Blackwell architectural transition also led to an unanticipated snag last year. Even though it was resolved subsequently, I believe the market will be a bit more careful in trying to be overly optimistic on a highly successful ramp from the onset. Therefore, a more measured cadence in backlog digestion, and revenue conversion should be expected throughout the rest of the fiscal year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, while most of Wall Street are still <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">highly ebullient on Nvidia’s thesis</a>, they're still seeing a sharp slowdown from fiscal 2028. Now, these are potentially placeholder estimates, as the pace of AI evolution and chip developments is so quick these days, it's really difficult to prognosticate even beyond a fiscal year. As we have observed for ourselves, Google has quickly seized the zeitgeist from behind, and also Anthropic Claude Code has surpassed the wildest imagination and is now threatening to upend even the most prominent software leaders, and leave them biting dust.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But, while Wall Street wants more visibility into fiscal 2027, management isn't yet biting the bait, and I thought that was prudent. Because ultimately, Jensen Huang is under immense pressure to consistently overdeliver and outperform his peers, which is something that isn't new to him, and I believe that he relishes the opportunity:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p> Again, we're trying to look at revenue quarter-by-quarter. As you think about the full year, we are absolutely going to be still selling and providing Blackwell, probably at the same time that we're also seeing Vera Rubin come to market. This is a very great architecture that helps them just today quickly standing up and have already planned on many different orders across the different customers to provide that. It's too early yet to determine how much in terms of that Vera Rubin, that beginning ramp will start in the second half, and we'll get through it. But no confusion in terms of the strong demand and the interest. We do expect pretty much every single customer to be purchasing Vera Rubin. The question is how soon are we in market and how soon are they able to stand that up in terms of in their data centers. - <em>Nvidia Q4 FY2026 earnings call</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, amid all this ruckus going on right now, there is no doubt that Jensen Huang is still right at the top of the podium. Even AMD's latest offerings in inference aren't a close match for Nvidia yet, showing the gulf in standards between the two companies, which should sustain its ability to drive not just a technological advantage, but also its emphasis on cost efficiencies in driving down TCOs for its customers, big or small, hyperscalers, or enterprise:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>When it comes to the latest inference techniques that are used by the most prominent frontier large-scale inference services (such as disagg prefill+wideEP+FP4), Nvidia absolutely frame mogs with the B200, B300 and ASU frat leader, rack scale GB200/GB300 NVL72 across both SGLang and TRTLLM. Nvidia GPUs also dominate when it comes to energy efficiency, with much lower all-in provisioned picoJoules of energy per token across all workloads. Turning to AMD, we find that the biggest issue with inference on their systems and using their software is composability. That is, many of AMDs inference optimization implementations work well in isolation, but when combined with other optimizations, the result is not as competitive as one would expect. Specifically, the composability of disagg prefill, wideEP and FP4 inference optimizations needs significant improvement. While performance is competitive on AMD when enabling just a subset of the SOTA inference optimizations, enabling all three major optimizations that labs use, AMD’s performance is currently not competitive with Nvidia’s. We strongly recommend to AMD that they focus heavily on composability of different inference optimizations. We have been told that AMD will start focusing on software composability of FP4+distributed inferencing across their whole software stack. This will happen after Chinese New Year as most of their disagg prefill+wideEP 10x inference engineers are based in China. Nvidia’s GB300 NVL72 doesn’t disappoint. It achieves up to 100x on FP8 vs FP4 compared to even a strong H100 disagg+wideEP+MTP baseline and 65x on FP8 vs FP8. On H100 vs GB200 NVL72, we see up to 55x realized performance difference at 75 tok/s/user. Rack scale Blackwell NVL72 is framemogging hopper and makes hopper looks like it is jestermaxxing. As Jensen said at GTC 2025, he is chief revenue destroyer. At GTC 2024, Jensen claimed that Blackwell will deliver up to 30x perf on inference compared to H100, Jensen under promised &amp; overdelivered on Blackwell inference performance. This should curtail the instances of analysts cracking “Jensen Math” jokes for some time. - <em>Semianalysis article on InferenceX v2: NVIDIA Blackwell Vs AMD vs Hopper</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These things matter, because Nvidia must remain the industry standard given how large its market share is, and how high its gross margins are. As long as Nvidia can continue to stay ahead through hardware and software, it is challenging to imagine how its rivals could carve out a sizeable portion of its market dominance at the expense of NVDA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I'm not ruling out the possibility that these companies could continue to gain share as the market matures, the burgeoning and massive AI CapEx outlay corroborates my belief that Nvidia will stay on top of these growth levers. Moreover, let's not forget that the company has already put in place the infrastructure and framework to transition to growth drivers beyond the data center, including in autonomous driving, physical AI, and even potentially space based data centers, which we know is no longer just a fictional figment of our wildest imagination, if SpaceX's upcoming IPO confidential filings are anything for us to think about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And just when we thought Nvidia could really lose it this time, with peers on the verge of breaking new ground, I say, don’t bet against Jensen Huang. There's a good reason why they rushed into the \"non-exclusive licensing deal\" with Groq over Christmas, despite that eye-watering price tag, showing the tremendous shrewdness and market awareness of Jensen Huang and his utmost determination to stay well ahead in his market:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Nvidia plans to unveil a new processor specially tailored to help OpenAI and other customers build faster, more efficient tools, a major shake-up to its business that is poised to reset the AI race. The company is designing a new system for “inference” computing, a form of processing that allows AI models to respond to queries, according to people familiar with the plans. The new platform, set to be revealed at Nvidia’s GTC developer conference in San Jose next month, will incorporate a chip designed by the startup Groq, the people said. - <em>WSJ article on Nvidia’s plans for new AI inference chip</em></p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Buy Or Sell NVDA Stock?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259369795765_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1336\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259369795765_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NVDA price chart (long-term, monthly)\" width=\"640\" height=\"418\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259369795765_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259369795765_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259369795765_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/51630113-1772259369795765_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">NVDA price chart (long-term, monthly) <span>(TradingView)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, before we dismiss the thesis that the market has given up on NVDA, I would like you to seriously contemplate it again. There is no doubt that NVDA has markedly underperformed its semiconductor peers over the past few months. In fact, if I were to do a candlestick counting on the long-term chart, this sell off has continued for seven months, with little respite for shareholders who attempted to even try to catch the falling knife.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But, as I mentioned earlier in my article, I indicated that we must take a longer term outlook when trying to assess NVDA’s price action. If you can see from the above chart, this looks just like previous pullbacks, multi-month in nature, but ultimately, nothing too worrying. The market has often found a sustained bottom when it retraced to the 50 month moving average (blue line), where the accumulation fervor begins to regain conviction again. And if you look at where we are right now, we are getting increasingly closer by the month. Note that, it has been almost one-way traffic for NVDA since the bottom against its peers in late 2022, which also coincided with the public launch of ChatGPT. Therefore, a well-deserved break that also aligns with profit taking among investors who were sitting on massive gains is more than welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you ask me, I will consider this a much-needed relief pullback, to set the stage for the subsequent recovery once the selling pressure has been firmly digested. With NVDA now trading at just &lt;26x forward earnings, it seems incredibly pessimistic when we take into account AMD’s 30x forward earnings and Broadcom’s 31x metric. The market appears to have given a lot of credibility to its competitors in gaining significant share against the king of AI, which could turn out to be premature and not validated. This disconnect in valuation between Nvidia and peers should close, in my opinion, and investors should not be too troubled about catching this retracement, as I'm confident that we will survive, and thrive, and see higher highs being taken out once the selling pressure has reached its nadir.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With NVDA’s price chart and comparison against peers now also having gone into the well oversold territory, all stars are almost aligned, suggesting that I can no longer ignore placing an even more bullish outlook on the stock while the market looks away in fear.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rating: Upgrade to Strong Buy.</p>",

As a local, you often end up putting the brakes on riskier investments because you know that in Brazil, complexity is high, political risks weigh heavily, and you<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> may even miss out on opportunities because of this.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, foreigners who are not so involved in day-to-day life tend to underestimate the risks a little, in my view. Of course, since much of the capital flow from investments in Brazil is driven by foreign investors, their opinion matters a lot, and even when they are “wrong,” they can often be right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most interesting thing is that with the rotation we are seeing, with capital leaving Mag 7s, often leaving the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"us\" htloopnumber=\"934745907\">US</em> in general, and going to emerging markets, the Brazil thesis is becoming even stronger, and the narrative that was previously negative is beginning to become positive.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bull Case For Foreign Investors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before I tell you the various reasons why a bull scenario is forming for the Brazilian stock market, we need to be aware of a couple of things first. During the pandemic, there was a lot of talk about the “party” (or, the celebration) of 200,000 points on the Ibovespa, which is the main stock index, that is, it was an important milestone for the stock market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But from 2019 to mid-2025, the Brazilian index remained flat, rising a little, falling a little, but very neutral in the end, and I think that shaped people's sentiment. I'm saying this because, in recent months, the index has performed very well, rising 53% in one year, and that's in BRL terms, not counting the devaluation of the USD, which would add more to this upside. I mean, even with the index close to the 200,000 mark, there is no optimism, no euphoria. Actually, it has been a very quiet bull market. There seems to be plenty of room for a bull market to really happen in the coming years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And this also depends on foreign investors. B3 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BOLSY\" title=\"B3 S.A. - Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão\">BOLSY</a>) is Brazil's only stock exchange. If we separate the categories, foreign investors account for the largest volume on the Brazilian stock exchange, obviously, if we separate Brazilian individuals, institutions, others, and then foreign investors as a single category. But even if we put all the domestic categories together, foreign investors still have a very large weight.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On February 24 (2026), foreign investors invested <a href=\"https://www.dadosdemercado.com.br/fluxo\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.dadosdemercado.com.br/fluxo\" target=\"_blank\">R$2.1 billion</a> in the Brazilian stock market, while institutional investors withdrew R$1.8 billion and individuals withdrew R$348 million. In January, the amount was R$26 billion, which attracted a lot of attention, so much so that B3 wrote an <a href=\"https://borainvestir.b3.com.br/tipos-de-investimentos/renda-variavel/acoes/estrangeiros-ingressam-com-r-2631-bilhoes-em-acoes-na-b3-em-janeiro-de-2026/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://borainvestir.b3.com.br/tipos-de-investimentos/renda-variavel/acoes/estrangeiros-ingressam-com-r-2631-bilhoes-em-acoes-na-b3-em-janeiro-de-2026/\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> pointing out that this was a record amount since the beginning of 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, 2022 was not a bull market in Brazil, but the interest rate was closer to 10% at the beginning of the year, and now it is at 15%, with no IPOs, and even so, foreign investors seem to be bullish.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And speaking of interest rates, this is precisely one of the arguments for a bull market. The interest rate of 15% is very high and restrictive even by Brazilian standards, and we are used to an environment of <a href=\"https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/monetarypolicy/selicrate\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.bcb.gov.br/en/monetarypolicy/selicrate\" target=\"_blank\">high rates</a>. The good news is that by the end of 2026, the Central Bank expects something close to <a href=\"https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/focus/focus/R20260220.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/focus/focus/R20260220.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">12%</a>, and by the end of 2027 something close to 10.5%.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722324801814408.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Interest Rates - Brazil\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"441\" height=\"388\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722324801814408.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722324801814408.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Brazilian Central Bank</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is good for several reasons. As I am a fundamental analyst, the triggers for companies are great and clear: most of them have debt linked to Brazil's base interest rate, and if it falls from 15% to 10%, net income rises significantly. Also, with greater incentives for consumption, companies linked to the domestic economy should see an increase in their top line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But another very important point for the bull market in the short term is the investors perception and what it does to the capital flow and portfolio allocation. Today, there is a lot of talk in Brazil about earning 1% net per month without doing anything. Yes, just by leaving your money in the bank, you already have more than 1% per month, which is why those who were watching the stock market from the sidelines end up preferring to leave their money in Treasury or fixed income in general. Now, with this coming to an end in the next few years, those who still want the famous 1% per month will have to take risks. Not to mention the euphoria itself: if foreigners start to enter, interest rates start to fall, and the stock market rises, those who are on the sidelines and have very little money allocated to risky assets will also want to return to the stock market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So we can assume a potential rotation for Brazilian stocks both from foreign investors, who are leaving American Treasuries, leaving tech stocks and going for international opportunities, and from Brazilian investors who today have very little exposure to the stock market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, a mixed point, but one that I will include here in this section, is the P/E ratio of the Brazilian stock market. Some argue that this valuation is still fair and far from a bull market. I understand this view. The P/E ratio is ~<a href=\"https://www.oceans14.com.br/acoes/historico-pl-bovespa\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.oceans14.com.br/acoes/historico-pl-bovespa\" target=\"_blank\">13x</a> (TTM), and the peaks of historical cycles are much closer to 16x, 17x, so there is still some multiple expansion to happen.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-1772232480394199_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1150\" data-height=\"544\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-1772232480394199_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"P/E - Brazil\" width=\"640\" height=\"303\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-1772232480394199_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-1772232480394199_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-1772232480394199_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-1772232480394199_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Brazilian P/E <span>(Oceans14)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And if companies' net income really increases, this could trigger a much bigger upside than from 13x to 16x earnings, which would be a 20% upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, we have the political scenario in Brazil. The current president is Lula, whom the most experienced market analysts already know well, and for this reason, I think foreign investors are not too concerned if the opposition does not win. After all, Lula was president for several years in a row in Brazil, and this was during several bull markets. In addition, I think that Americans, in particular, were not so accustomed (at least not until a few years ago) to worrying about issues such as inflation and government debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, it may even be somewhat paradoxical, since while local investors are more cautious, foreign investors may arrive with abundant liquidity and go against the fundamentals, but at the same time, triggering optimism for local investors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bear Case for Locals</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Starting with the government, I think this is the main point that differentiates Brazil from other countries. Being here and reading Brazilian newspapers, we are constantly bombarded with various scandals and negative points about the state in general. And it is natural that concern increases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, if you talk to any serious political analyst in Brazil, they will tell you about fiscal concerns, since there is not much room in the public budget today, public spending is very high and growing, and new taxes are emerging all the time, such as the newest tax related to technology (check it <a href=\"https://en.clickpetroleoegas.com.br/brasil-aumentou-imposto-de-mais-de-mil-importados-e-ate-smartphone-entrou-na-lista-governo-fala-em-proteger-industria-mhbb01/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://en.clickpetroleoegas.com.br/brasil-aumentou-imposto-de-mais-de-mil-importados-e-ate-smartphone-entrou-na-lista-governo-fala-em-proteger-industria-mhbb01/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). So if there are no major reforms, either in terms of increasing tax revenue or the long-awaited reduction in public spending, the outlook for the public budget is definitely not the best, and this impacts interest rates, inflation, confidence in institutions, and everything else. Going into a little more detail, remember I mentioned that one of the triggers for the bull market is interest rates? If spending continues to be uncontrolled and increases more than expected, we are unlikely to see interest rates falling sharply.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of confidence in institutions, this is a critical point. Recently, the Banco Master case came to light, and I won't go into detail, but it's basically related to billion-dollar fraud, which at the same time diminishes trust in institutions such as the Supreme Court (check it <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2026-01-21/the-banco-master-case-the-2-billion-fraud-probe-that-is-shaking-brazil.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://english.elpais.com/international/2026-01-21/the-banco-master-case-the-2-billion-fraud-probe-that-is-shaking-brazil.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). As written in <a href=\"https://www.cov.com/en/news-and-insights/insights/2026/02/brazils-banco-master-scandal-and-why-it-matters-for-foreign-investors\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.cov.com/en/news-and-insights/insights/2026/02/brazils-banco-master-scandal-and-why-it-matters-for-foreign-investors\" target=\"_blank\">Covington</a>, this also matters to foreign investors:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>“While there seems to be no immediate and direct impact, aside from the increased perception of corruption and political risk, there might be long-term consequences.”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this, in my view, does not make Brazil completely uninvestable. Even with all these uncertainties, there are still companies that manage to be profitable and really generate shareholder value, such as Klabin (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KLBAY\" title=\"Klabin S.A.\">KLBAY</a>), which has been around for over 100 years. However, all this uncertainty in Brazilian politics and institutions, in addition to macroeconomic risk, is very much in line with valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps you, as a foreign investor, see the P/E ratio of Brazilian stocks with an average of ~13x and think “dirt cheap,” because <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"us\" htloopnumber=\"934745907\">US</em> stocks are generally traded at 20x earnings or even more. However, 13x earnings is already high for the Brazilian context, especially when you consider that companies such as Vale and Petrobras have a very important weight in the main indexes and are highly cyclical companies, not to mention that Petrobras and other companies are at risk of state intervention.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To see this, it is worth taking earnings yield into account instead of P/E. Today, PBR stock is trading at 6.8x earnings for 2026. Seems cheap, right? Well, but that gives an earnings yield of 14%. Remember, Brazil's Treasury yield is paying 15%, and even if that falls to 12% or even 10%, is it really worth having a little more return to take the risk of owning a Brazilian state-owned company? And remember that Petrobras has already traded at a P/E ratio below 4x, so 6.8x doesn't really seem like a bargain to me; in fact, it seems that the equity risk premium is low.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I know that this may often not be an obstacle for foreign investors, who would <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"934745907\">buy</em> anyway, bringing in the flow and triggering a bull market, re-rating for these blue chips, etc., but I don't feel comfortable with this margin of safety, especially considering the risks that are masked by this high yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the elections, I believe that here people are much more afraid of a continuation of the Lula government than foreigners are. It seems too early to say who will win, especially since the candidates are not yet well established, but on Polymarket, Lula already has a ~50% chance of winning, which seems like a reasonable assumption, since the overwhelming majority of presidents in Brazil manage to get re-elected because they have the state apparatus at their disposal. As the market is unpredictable, it is difficult to say for sure that if Lula wins, the bull market will not happen, but in any case, it is one more obstacle, not to mention that volatility is to be expected as we get closer to the election.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722324803093069_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"985\" data-height=\"395\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722324803093069_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Brazilian Election\" width=\"640\" height=\"257\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722324803093069_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722324803093069_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722324803093069_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722324803093069_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Polymarket</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another point I need to mention is that I don't know exactly whether it is foreign investors who are overly optimistic about Brazil, or whether it is just a general rotation. Especially because, if we look at the indexes of other international markets, the EWZ does not stand out that much, but South Korea (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EWY\" title=\"iShares MSCI South Korea ETF\">EWY</a>) and Peru (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EPU\" title=\"iShares MSCI Peru and Global Exposure ETF\">EPU</a>) certainly do, and Brazil is only similar to Mexico (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EWW\" title=\"iShares MSCI Mexico ETF\">EWW</a>), which in my view is the main peer.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_542f91b876fc58e4041a23640591d095.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_542f91b876fc58e4041a23640591d095.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_542f91b876fc58e4041a23640591d095.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_542f91b876fc58e4041a23640591d095.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So I believe we should ask ourselves: are foreigners really buying Brazilian stocks because they are optimistic about the short term, or has only a portion of that money spilled over into Brazil due to natural diversification, ETFs, portfolio weighting, etc., while most of it went to other markets such as South Korea? If it is not widespread optimism, perhaps the bull market will not gain much momentum for now, so we will really need a second trigger, such as a more favorable election for a pro-market candidate or a real macroeconomic improvement.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How I Would Look At This As A Foreigner</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So I am left with this duality. On the one hand, I don't like the big Brazilian companies at current prices, but they are also the ones that could rise the most in the short term due to liquidity and strong foreign capital inflows. Consider, for example, that large hedge funds are not going to come to Brazil and <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"934745907\">buy</em> mid or small caps; they are going to <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"934745907\">buy</em> Petrobras, Vale, or not even that; they are going to put 5% of their portfolio in an index like EWZ and that's it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's basically what <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553189-brazil-for-druckenmiller-tepper-likes-ewy-berkshire-enters-nyt-13f-roundup\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553189-brazil-for-druckenmiller-tepper-likes-ewy-berkshire-enters-nyt-13f-roundup\" target=\"_blank\">Druckenmiller did</a>; he bought EWZ and call options in Q4 2025, but of course, he is a tactical investor. There are other types of funds that will look deeper and <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"934745907\">buy</em> stocks separately or make a more long-term investment, but in my view, the foreign “value investor,” focused on long-term holding, who wants to <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"934745907\">buy</em> Brazil is the minority of the minority. The majority will try to ride the bull market in rotation and leave in a few quarters or, in a better scenario, stay for a few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Incidentally, FLBR <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"vs\" htloopnumber=\"934745907\">vs</em>. EWZ is an interesting point that I may address in another article. Both are solid ways to gain exposure to Brazil, with EWZ having stocks such as Nu Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NU\" title=\"Nu Holdings Ltd.\">NU</a>), bringing greater diversification, while FLBR is more interesting due to its lower expense ratio and more stocks in the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, can ETFs such as EWZ and FLBR take advantage of this bull market? Definitely. But I don't think it's the best option. I would prefer to filter opportunities better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just to mention a little bit about the reason for this, I think Vale (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VALE\" title=\"Vale S.A.\">VALE</a>) is already slightly overpriced, but that's because I'm also bearish on iron ore, and as the stock has risen a lot recently, I think the margin of safety has decreased. Itaú Unibanco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ITUB\" title=\"Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A.\">ITUB</a>) is a great bank in terms of quality, but the price is already very close to fair value. It's something where you can earn Brazilian interest rates + a small coupon (like 2% or 3%), check out the article about ITUB <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4864107-ita-unibanco-when-15-percent-plus-a-year-still-isnt-enough-downgrade\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4864107-ita-unibanco-when-15-percent-plus-a-year-still-isnt-enough-downgrade\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But I think there are many more interesting opportunities in mid and small caps. I think Klabin is at a good price and is a high-quality company. Inter (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTR\" title=\"Inter &amp; Co, Inc.\">INTR</a>) is another small cap, Nu Holdings' main peer, but it trades at a valuation that is a fraction of NU stock. Not to mention related companies such as Mercado Libre (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MELI\" title=\"MercadoLibre, Inc.\">MELI</a>), which is not a Brazilian company, but is very directly linked to the Brazilian economy and is a company with very interesting prospects.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think my conclusion here, and perhaps you have noticed from the length of the text and the amount of information, is that Brazil is definitely more complex than it seems. Could a bull market occur in the coming years? Yes, but that depends on several factors, not just rotation, not just politics, and not just macroeconomics. For this reason, I prefer to be very rigorous in my stock picking when it comes to Brazilian stocks, especially at the current valuation, where the margin of safety is not the best.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, the opportunity in Brazil is not exactly in buying indexes, but rather in finding some good names that will allow you to ride this potential bull market, but with much less risk.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, the main ETFs in Brazil are currently much more suited to a hold rating in my opinion.</p>",

The report suggests the GDP to reach around $26 trillion before 2050, with per capita income exceeding $15,000—a significant milestone considering the largeness of the population and the current number. Even though these are projected estimates, they are capable of drawing the point about India’s forward looking growth prospects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/64152725-17722009221126797.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"India growth story\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EY India@100 <span>(EY Report)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While India has been on a structural growth trajectory—and that continues to be the case—the translation of that growth into investor returns might need closer examination. The point, as an equity investor, is how much of that growth can actually be translated into stock market returns, which are a function of current valuations and forward expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Long-term returns are a function of earnings growth, dividends, and changes in the P/E multiple. Betting on P/E expansion only makes sense from a relatively low starting base, which is not exactly the case here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a nutshell, while the Indian growth story may remain intact, how much of that ultimately translates into stock market appreciation needs to be examined. This becomes even more relevant for investors domiciled outside India, who must account for currency differentials, along with other associated factors.

In contrast, the Nifty 50 is a broad free-float market capitalization–weighted index, where constituent weights are determined in accordance with the index methodology.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>NFTY – Equal-Weighted Nifty 50 Strategy vs</strong><strong>. iShares India ETF – Free-Float Market-Cap Weighted Strategy</strong> </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The structural advantage of an equal-weighted strategy lies in its inherent design, which functions as a mechanical rebalancing tool. By mandate, the portfolio must periodically trim outperformers and buy underperformers to maintain equal weights, effectively forcing a \"buy low, sell high\" discipline. Yes, it is cutting down the flowers and watering the weeds, and that works in this context.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While this approach is not a viable framework for active stock picking—since it ignores a company’s fundamental developments. However, it presents an interesting case for ETFs and index fund universe. Essentially, the strategy favours companies that are currently underperforming in terms of quotational price basis by increasing their stake while selling off those that have surged. It consists of an element of mean reversion— that causes a slight better performance than the broad-based capitalization weighted indexes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In that sense, NFTY has certain advantages over other broad-based capitalization weighted index traded funds such as INDY and similar others.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk &amp; Other Factors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most important constraint in any equal weight index is capacity—that is, the capital it can deploy under its mandate. As opposed to capitalization-focused indices, which naturally constitute weights by taking into account their tradable free float, an equal weight strategy necessarily allocates the same amount of capital irrespective of the size, volume, and liquidity of the underlying company. Thus, for any equal weighted mandate, as the fund size grows, this structure can mechanically increase market impact, execution friction, and tracking error, thereby reducing scalability and attractiveness. That makes it comparatively less efficient for sizable allocations relative to market capitalization indices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, as already mentioned, currency depreciation can meaningfully reduce returns for a US-domiciled investor even when the underlying entities are performing fairly well. Total return for such an investor is a function of both local equity performance and currency movement. The return attributable to a domestic investor would, in a depreciation cycle, exceed that of a USD-based investor. Currency hedging may be an option for some investors; however, hedges are neither costless nor particularly convenient to manage.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I believe the Indian economic outlook and growth trajectory to be in line with the expectations, I do not feel convinced about the attractiveness of broader stock market indices from the lenses of foreign investors. Neither I buy the narrative of the Indian growth story with reference to broad-based stock market optimism, and even if one does, once currency volatility and fluctuations are accounted for, the case becomes materially weaker for an investor domiciled outside India, such as in the United States.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, for someone who intends to maintain exposure to the broader Indian equity market regardless, NFTY offers an interesting avenue, providing an <em>equal-weighted exposure</em> to the largest enterprises in India.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I consider exposure via NFTY to be comparatively better than that <em>of </em>iShares India 50 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INDY\" title=\"iShares India 50 ETF\">INDY</a>) or other ETFs tracking the Nifty 50, unless the allocation size is a constraint. The Nifty 50 Equal Weight Index has a reasonable probability of continuing to outperform the traditional Nifty 50, and ETFs based on the equal-weight methodology may continue to reflect that advantage over some more time.</p>",

The concept simply was that with a few rate cuts in, and making their way through the digestive system of<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> markets, the long-lost private market sponsor component would be reanimated in capital markets. It was beginning to prove out among the advisory shops and the data in general as discussed previously that deals with financial sponsors were resuming. For Grosvenor this still hasn't really kicked in, and given that it's lagging the rest of the markets we continue the recovery in carried interest in the mix to be a latent effect that will help 2026 figures at some point. Until then fundraising at record levels, driven by their successful, idiosyncratic cross-selling strategy has been driving figures. In terms of the recent market wobbles around SaaS, we also note that Grosvenor has not been meaningfully exposed and may even benefit in their ARS (effectively alternative public markets or hedge fund offerings) businesses in the form of higher performance fees (</span><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1819796/000181979626000010/gcm-20251231.htm#i56b003f605cc42f6bbcec4a3b79d5eba_13\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">carried interest being the performance fees but for the private businesses</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> which are all ex-ARS). It's still appears cheap on an EV/AUM basis compared to other PE GP peers.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/637/121637/original.pdf\">Commenting on some of the business elements as they reflect the markets</a>, we note lagging PE AUM growth. This is consistent with private credit taking up more share and picking up the slack to keep the private category growing. Absolute return strategies or ARS have been flat over the last few years, but up recently. Hedge funds and other alternative, more public markets related AM has been sidelined for a decade now in favour of the massively growing private equity industry, which has been fundraising successfully and building dry powder even in these last couple of years when portfolio turnover has been really low. Hence private markets AUM has grown considerably as a percentage of the business over the last few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566499030092_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1034\" data-height=\"798\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566499030092_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"aum by strategy\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"494\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566499030092_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566499030092_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566499030092_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566499030092_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AUM by strategy <span>(Q4 Pres)</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566610981593_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1041\" data-height=\"805\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566610981593_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"fund closings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"495\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566610981593_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566610981593_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566610981593_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-17722566610981593_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Fund closings <span>(Q4 Pres)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of more immediate results. Fundraising has been at record levels across geographies and asset classes in Q4. The expectation is flat growth into Q1 2026, so sequentially into the next quarter, as it concerns private markets but up 5% as it concerns ARS on great performance and fundraising. ARS could get an extra benefit from SaaS volatility in the Q1, up until that point only <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4868232-gcm-grosvenor-inc-gcmg-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">4% of overall AUM and less than 6% of credit AUM</a> is exposed to SaaS across their assets, and hedge funds should be able to pick up some babies thrown out with the bathwater for Q1 performance, as there has been a selective recovery in SaaS stocks that aren't actually that exposed to AI or may even be the tool of agentic AI down the line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-1772256927786505_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1043\" data-height=\"801\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-1772256927786505_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"unrealised carried interest\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"492\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-1772256927786505_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-1772256927786505_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-1772256927786505_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-1772256927786505_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Unrealised carry <span>(Q4 Pres)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Carried interest is up, though \"old\" carry is down as reported by management, but there is still more accrual on NAV calculations than actual realisations of carry on exits. Hence overall unrealised carry is up and that does reflect a situation where there is still limited liquidity in private markets due to reticent sponsor activity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-1772257050683_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1018\" data-height=\"276\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-1772257050683_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"performance fees and carried interst\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"174\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-1772257050683_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-1772257050683_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-1772257050683_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-1772257050683_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Performance fees and carried interest <span>(Q4 Pres)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is borne out also in the fee breakdown. Performance fees coming from ARS are up YoY while carried interest in down. Seasonally, Q4 isn't usually the strongest quarter with Q3 taking that spot, but carried interest is really low here. We think the building unrealised interest does signal a considerable latent component as it's likely that realisations will start accelerating with costs of capital normalising, perhaps headed even lower once Powell is out and Warsh is in - <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-30/warsh-set-to-face-early-reality-check-as-trump-s-man-at-the-fed\" rel=\"nofollow\">although no assurances of that</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In general, we expect latent growth with 12% AUM growth but not yet fee paying AUM growth up 27% per year. In general, the cross selling strategy continues to be a major lever for the business' top line with 20-25% of fundraising in any given year having come from cross selling products to existing clients. Considerable operating leverage has been achieved and the company believes it can keep that OpEx at controlled levels. We've actually <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4866179-oppenheimer-holdings-public-markets-come-back-driving-ecm-and-profits\">seen this before with more idiosyncratic AM platforms.</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-1772257435884479_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1025\" data-height=\"794\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-1772257435884479_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"income statement\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"496\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-1772257435884479_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-1772257435884479_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-1772257435884479_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/50103188-1772257435884479_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Income Statement <span>(Q4 Pres)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is also additional growth coming in from new initiatives to tap wealth management distribution by offering white label solutions and other semi-liquid funds that can work in a wealth management distribution model and move more retail money at wealth managers into underallocated alternative assets. Wealth management is only<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4868967-gcm-grosvenor-inc-gcmg-presents-at-ubs-financial-services-conference-2026-transcript\"> 5% of Grosvenor capital</a> currently and could be a lot more given that retail wealth is secularly underallocated to alternative assets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Grosvenor traded down together with the markets and they tactically increased their buyback by $35 million, meaning $91 million left in the programme. They also refinanced for $3 million in interest savings, which is alone a couple of pct points of net income in 2025. The dividend yield is not that low on Grosvenor either, and the buyback will reduce the cash burden from paying dividends to those extra shares. It's a constructive capital allocation strategy. In terms of valuation, the EV/AUM is around 2.6%. <a href=\"https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/PARTNERS-GROUP-HOLDING-AG-175123/valuation/\" rel=\"noopener\">Partners Group has around a 15%</a> as a PE and alternative assets comp based <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/earnings/partners-group-rises-5-as-2025-aum-hits-185-bln-sets-strong-2026-view-4448917\" rel=\"nofollow\">on their latest AUM disclosure</a>. It comes across as still cheap. We feel they should be able to monetise their AUM nearly as well as Partners Group in a low cost of capital environment.</p>",
