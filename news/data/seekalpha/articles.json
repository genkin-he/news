During our update, the following chart caught our attention and led<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> us to rethink the classic notion of blue-chip safety, embodied by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, relative to assets that are perceived as “riskier,” such as the growth-oriented NASDAQ index. To wit, the chart shows the dividend yield spread ('YS') between the QQQ and DIA ETFs since the 2000s. The YS has been persistently negative over the long term, thanks to the Dow Jones index's focus on mature and blue-chip stocks, which in turn led to higher capital return to investors in the form of dividend payouts. DIA’s long-term average yield is a considerable 1.56% above that from QQQ.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, note that the YS, sitting at around -0.969%, is not only far above the historical average of -1.56% but also close to the peak level of -0.878% observed since ~2000. Such an elevated YS suggests to me that investors should not take DIA’s safety for granted under today’s market conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As will be elaborated next, such a YS brought Dow’s safety into question for several reasons. And the subsequent sections will detail the top two on my list: the protection role of blue-chips’ current yield and also Dow’s valuation risks when adjusted for growth.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1363\" data-height=\"827\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph with a line graph AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"388\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dow’s dividend advantage is diminished</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As aforementioned, a large reason behind Dow’s reputation for safety is the mature status of its holdings, which allows them to pay out more generous dividends. A higher current yield, in turn, provides a thicker cushion against downturns. Admittedly, this is still the case now. As you can see from the following chart, DIA still provides the highest TTM yield in absolute terms compared against other indices. To wit, DIA’s current TTM dividend yield is 1.42%, followed by VOO and SPY’s 1.13% and 1.07%, respectively (proxies to the SP500), IWM’s 0.98% (proxy to small caps), and finally QQQ’s 0.45% (proxy to the NASDAQ index).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the dividend yield advantage of blue-chip stocks is quite diminished under today’s market, either by vertical or horizontal comparison. As a horizontal comparison and as just mentioned above, DIA’s dividend yield relative to QQQ is near the thinnest level since the 2000s, indicating its diminished yield and valuation advantage compared to more growth-oriented assets. As a vertical comparison, DIA’s current TTM dividend yield is 1.42%, which is about 19% below its 4-year average yield of 1.75%, as seen. Expanding the time horizon, the picture becomes even more concerning. As you can see from the second chart below, DIA’s current yield is not only far below its average in the past 20 years or so (about 2.07%) but also near the lowest levels in this period. The last time DIA’s yield dropped lower than the current level dates back to the peak of the dot-com bubble.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1536\" data-height=\"283\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph with numbers and symbols AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"118\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1353\" data-height=\"481\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph of a stock market AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"228\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation risks adjusted for growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As another reflection of DIA’s risks, the table below shows my assessments of various indices’ valuation risks when adjusted by their growth potential. Here, I am using their dividend growth in the past 3 to 5 years to represent their growth rates under the assumption that dividend payouts reflect the true economic earnings of the underlying companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown in this table, the Dow Jones index has been suffering dampened growth in this period when compared to other market segments. DIA’s dividend growth was only about 2.5% CAGR in the past 3 years and about 2.84% CAGR in the past 5 years. In contrast, the “overall” market represented by VOO showed much faster growth rates, with a 3-year CAGR at 6.6% and a 5-year CAGR of 5.64%, roughly doubling the growth rates of DIA. The QQQ ETF has demonstrated even faster growth rates with a 3-year CAGR of 12.89% and a 5-year CAGR of 11.67%, more than quadrupling the growth rates of DIA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result of the vast differences in their growth rates, DIA has the highest PEG ratio (P/E growth ratio) among all the indices tabulated, as seen. Note that the P/E ratios I used here were either taken from the funds’ web pages as of this writing or inferred based on their latest fund disclosures. DIA’s current P/E ratio is relatively low in absolute terms (at around 23.0x), only higher than IWM’s 18.4x. However, when based on the 3- and 5-year dividend growth rates, DIA’s PEG ratio is in the range of 8.1x to 9.1x, far above the PEG ratio from all other indices listed here. Note that QQQ, despite its highest P/E ratio of 44.3x in absolute terms, actually features the lowest PEG ratio of 3.4 to 3.8x thanks to its growth rates.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1537\" data-height=\"394\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A white paper with black text and numbers AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"164\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other risks and final thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To recap, my skepticism about Dow's \"blue-chip safety\" when compared to other more growth-oriented assets (such as the NASDAQ, SP500, and small caps) is largely based on the yield spread and PEG ratios. A key counterargument and a limitation to my analysis involve its sensitivity to interest rate changes. The use of both yield spread and PEG ratios can be sensitive to the interest rate outlook. Either by a discounted dividend model or a discounted cash flow model, growth stocks (such as those held in NASDAQ) tend to be considered longer-duration assets than value stocks like those held under the Dow index. As such, growth stocks could suffer disproportionately when interest rates rise because their distant future dividends and earnings are discounted more aggressively. Judging by the language used in the latest <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251029a.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251029a.htm\" target=\"_blank\">FOMC statement</a> (released on Oct. 29 by the Fed) and the specific vote counts, it is very unclear to me which direction interest rates will go next.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To conclude, investors have good reasons to consider DJI and DIA as safer assets compared to other market segments more focused on growth stocks. However, I suggest investors reexamine these reasons under today’s market conditions. My examination has led me to question this traditional wisdom. I don’t believe DIA is safer judging by its current valuation risks relative to other market sectors either in terms of yield or growth-adjusted P/E. Actually, I see large odds for DIA (or DJI) to suffer a more severe correction than SPY and/or QQQ if/when the next significant market downturn occurs.</p>",

It took a bit of a dramatic pullback in recent sessions. Got a lot of people asking questions about gold. Can the rally continue? Are the fundamentals still there? Joining us now to discuss is Daniel Ghali, Senior Commodity Strategist with TD Securities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Daniel, great to have you back on the program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel Ghali:</strong> Yeah, of course. Thanks for having me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> You got the question, if not of the day, of the week, of the month, perhaps even the year. What is going on with gold, and what can we expect going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel Ghali:</strong> Yeah, [LAUGHS] I mean, that's a fantastic question. But the way that I would look at it is that, thus far, over the course of the entire bull market in gold, it's really not been a question of demand. It's been a question of trust.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And for this year in particular, trust in the US dollar, trust in US institutions has really been the factor that's been changing. How else can we explain this idea that stock markets are doing quite well, and credit markets are at their tights, and we're in a nascent bond market, and commodity prices are rising and gold prices are ripping? The common denominator is really the answer there, which is the US dollar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So this is another way of saying the debasement trade has really been the primary driver. And when I think about the next few months, I actually think that we could be nearing an inflection point for the debasement trade, which means that it can either be reinforced, or actually it can be challenged. What I'm specifically thinking about here is a few of the Supreme Court decisions that are on the docket between now and likely January of the new year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> We've had guests on the show, and I think maybe some of your colleagues, like Bart Melek, talking about the fact that you take a look at gold at these levels, can it go higher from here? Of course, it can. Can it go lower? Of course, it can. When you talk about all these different catalysts coming, is it very hard to peg gold at saying, we're going to get another sizable upleg or just sort of stay where we are?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel Ghali:</strong> Yeah I mean, the way I think about it is I think about it in terms of the flows. Who's buying and who's selling? And when you think about who has bought gold in the last, $700-800 rally, it's really been quite different than who has been buying gold over the course of the bull market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We see signs of extreme FOMO from several different cohorts, including discretionary traders or macro funds, and including systematic trend followers, who recently have been actually selling. Concerning to me is this idea that retail participants probably have their highest exposure in gold since at least 2011, which was another meaningful year for a pullback.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, from a positioning perspective, it's all lining up towards extremes. But some of the more structural drivers, such as central bank demand, remains strong but has been weakening year to date. The total number might still be elevated, but it's less elevated than the prior year, which is less elevated than the prior year, and so on and so forth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So you really needed those other cohorts to step in, and they have. Now that they have, the question is, can they be challenged? And I do think that between now and year end, a challenge is coming.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> Alright, challenge is coming in the gold space. We'll watch out for that one. You've been writing a lot about silver over the last little while, about the squeeze, about the unwind. What is going on right now with silver?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel Ghali:</strong> Yeah, I mean, the way we've been phrasing it to our clients is, the silver squeeze you can buy into. That's been premised on this idea that the freely available stockpile of silver sitting in London vaults has been declining. It's been declining as a function of a structural deficit. But that's also been accelerated by the threat of tariffs, which incentivized traders to move metal from London into the US earlier this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, over the course of this month, we've seen that climax. We've seen the structure of silver markets become so critically challenged that the price had to trade substantially higher in order to incentivize metal to come back into the system from unconventional sources. Now that that has occurred, we actually think that we're headed towards a silver flood.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And what I'm referring to there is what will probably end up being the single-largest wave of repletion of London silver inventories on record. Thus far, we think there's at least around 50 million ounces that has made its way back to London from the US, from China, and indeed from ETF liquidations. And that last bit is actually the most important because silver is typically seen as a Giffen good, meaning people buy more of it as the price rises.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The challenge now is that we've struggled to sustain a break above $50 an ounce, which is a psychological level. Because we've struggled to maintain a break above it, it might actually end up looking like a fail break, which is something that could change the psyche around silver as a Giffen good. People might sell because it didn't manage to sustain that breakout.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An ETF liquidation is equivalent to a direct addition to the free float as well. So that is, again, now becoming a self-reinforcing process to the downside, until such a time that there are less available inventories in the US and there are less available inventories in China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> How much downside should investors be bracing themselves for? As you said, struggle to stay above $50. It's about $48.65 on my screen right now. If you get that flood of silver, how much pressure could we see to the downside?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel Ghali:</strong> Well, I want to balance that answer because on the one hand, it's very hard to see a scenario outside of a deep recession where silver can trade at $30-35 an ounce again. On the other hand, most of the rally that we've seen in this last leg has been a function of a liquidity crisis, not of a demand surge, actually. By our accounts, the combined demand that pulled metal out of London was roughly the same size as it was in February 2024. And if you go back to your charts and look at how did silver prices look back then, you'd see that the price really didn't do all that much during that month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, this isn't a function of a huge wave of demand hitting silver markets and therefore the price is rising. It's a function of the fact that the market couldn't absorb what is a large but typical pace of demand over the course of the last month. That's now changing. So, in our view, we don't need silver prices to be as high as they are today or to continue to rise in order to draw in metal from unconventional sources anymore, which means the path is to the downside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> OK, so we covered off gold. We covered off silver. What's going on with copper?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel Ghali:</strong> Well, copper has a particularly virtuous cycle that is ongoing. Firstly, from a supply-demand perspective, we've become accustomed to large-scale mining disruptions over the last year. But it's increasingly apparent that the world can no longer absorb these kinds of typical but large mining disruptions, either.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So one large mine comes to mind recently that's had a very large disruption. And the market's assessment is that, while we expect it to have a surplus next year, that surplus is gone. It's likely going to be a deficit year again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But even further than that, what I think the market is currently missing is this idea that, because concentrate supply-- what comes out of the mines-- is becoming so challenged, this is actually the first year in several years where smelter output, the processing of it, which ends up delivering the units that are actually traded, the smelter capacity might actually decline as a function of the scarcity emanating through the supply chain. That is a directly positive impact on copper prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Separately, I'd say there's so much work that's been done on how much copper is going to be consumed by AI, and it is going to be significant. But another thing people are missing is how proximate this demand is. This isn't a 2030 story anymore. This is a 2026--</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> They want it now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel Ghali:</strong> It's now, yeah, because data centers are being built as we speak. So 2026, 2027, even 2028, this is demand that is needed now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And further to that, we've not even really begun to consider how China will try to compete on data centers. Thus far, the US has really been leading the charge. But as you know, in the recent Five-Year Plan, AI has really been one of the focal points for Chinese policymakers. And so, depending on how they choose to compete, this could potentially even double the copper demand emanating from AI and data centers.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.moneytalkgo.com/video/gold-market-fundamentals-as-rally-takes-pause/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p>",

If you are, there are so many puns to be had. I think it's best as I welcome you to the end of October if you'd share with us where your mind is at these days, what you're most focused on this week going into next week.</p> <p><strong>Brian Stewart: </strong>It was a busy week this week. We had a bunch of earnings, pretty much the the part of the earning season this this past week, and then we had the the Fed meeting.</p> <p>Let's start with the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511483-bessent-applauds-feds-25-bp-cut-but-says-this-fed-is-stuck-in-the-past\">Fed meeting</a>, I guess. They lowered interest rates by a quarter percentage point, which is exactly what people expected them to do.</p> <p>It was highly anticipated. However, the information coming out of the meeting, showed that the fed is highly divided in terms of where policy should go.</p> <p>So there were two dissenting votes on the the Fed's policy setting committee, one who wanted to cut rates by a full half percentage point and then another who didn't want to cut rates at all. So that just underlines the complications that are going on within the Fed. So they're kind of torn between the worry about inflation, which is still hovering around 3%, the Fed's target is 2%.</p> <p>And the fear that the economy is starting to slow down, especially the labor market. We've seen some layoff announcements, major layoff announcements recently.</p> <p>I think the most high profile one was Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), who said it was cutting 14,000 corporate jobs, though there were reports that that could eventually reach as much as 30,000.</p> <p>So you have this concern about the underlying economy, but you also have this lingering inflation concern.</p> <p>And so this is being played out in the market. Going into a week ago, going into this Fed meeting, there was an over 90% chance that there'd be another rate cut in December. So we get the rate cut we expected this week and then another one in December.</p> <p>That percentage chance has dropped to about 65%, so still a pretty good chance that we'll get a rate cut in December. But as chairman Powell said in his press conference, this is not a foregone conclusion.</p> <p>So the the waters around, interest rates and around the economy continue to get muddy.</p> <p><strong>RS: </strong>What else would you say to your point about Amazon's layoffs? Is it mostly an economic concern? Are these mostly economic concerns? Are there unknowns coming down the road that companies are being extra cautious about?</p> <p>Because Amazon released some pretty great earnings. What else would you add to that conversation about the abundance of layoffs?</p> <p><strong>BS: </strong>Well, I think there's two parallel areas of concern around the labor market. One is longer term, one is shorter term.</p> <p>On the short term front, you just have an economy that's showing signs of at least becoming more mixed. It's less of an obviously bullish situation. And so that leads to situations where you could get some layoffs.</p> <p>There's also the larger structural concern about AI and replacing workers. I mean, there's a whole host of industries where you could see large scale replacement of humans with computer technology.</p> <p>I think those are playing out at the same time. And so it's hard to judge which factor is is at work in in company decision making.</p> <p>It could be one of those things where in light of short term economic uncertainty, they're keeping a close eye on costs, at least in terms of labor costs, as we'll talk about when we get to earnings.</p> <p>Other types of expenses, companies are perfectly willing to to spend large amounts on. But having cut those workers, there might be the sense that there's not really a plan to ever bring them back, that they're gonna try and find ways to replace them with technology.</p> <p>And so as it plays out in in Fed policy, there was the expectation that you get rate cuts happening in this sort of incremental fashion.</p> <p>So you get incrementally lower rates, you get a cut in October, you get a cut in December, maybe a cut in January as the they're trying to stimulate the economy.</p> <p>But if it's just a long term structural situation, if jobs are gonna start being replaced, generally, there's nothing that rate cuts are gonna do really to save those particular jobs.</p> <p>Meanwhile, you have this <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4823812-inflation-expectations-tech-valuations-healthcare-opportunities\">overhang</a>, and this is more of a near term threat, at least according to some people within the Fed of inflation, which is still above the target and has been stubbornly above the target for a while now.</p> <p><strong>RS: </strong>It seems that some of the solutions that we've always counted on or correlations that we've always counted on are no longer relevant as we evolve into this next stage of of evolutionary market matter.</p> <p><strong>BS:</strong> I think that's a good way to to think about it too is kinda the new normal situation. It's always challenging to know whether or not it's actually different this time.</p> <p>There's always people willing to bet that it will be and always people reminding you that most times when you say it's different this time, it isn't.</p> <p>So it's hard in the moment to know. That's a clear retrospect thing where you know, oh, yeah. That was a a real turning point in the economy that things are different now than they used to be.</p> <p>And, honestly, we're probably not gonna know for a few years whether we're at that moment now or whether we're gonna learn a harsh lesson at some point.</p> <p><strong>RS: </strong>As we suss out what's coming and what's going and what and what we've had, what what earnings would you point to? What is your sense? A lot of tech names, some non tech names. What would you say about the earnings season thus far?</p> <p><strong>BS:</strong> I think the best stock to look at as a sort of pivot point or just a way to organize talking about is Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>). So Meta reported pretty good earnings in terms of its basic performance.</p> <p>The company took a $16,000,000,000 tax charge. So it missed expectations on the bottom line, but only because of this one time charge. It seems as if the tax rate is going to be relatively normal going forward.</p> <p>So the stock dropped about 11% after earnings. There was some talk about this charge contributing to that. But I really think that the underlying concern that investors had is with the increase in spending that we're seeing at Meta.</p> <p>So R&amp;D expenses topped $15,000,000,000 in Q3. That was up from 12,900,000,000. 0 in Q2, up 36%, from last year. It's the highest R&amp;D cost growth since 2022 when the company was ramping up its metaverse expenses.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the company in its guidance going forward said that it expects <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510953-meta-anticipates-capex-dollar-growth-to-rise-notably-in-2026-with-ai-investments\">CapEx growth</a> will be notably larger in 2026 compared to 2025. So this is just the beginning. 2026, we're gonna see even more, spending from Meta.</p> <p>Meanwhile, if you look at a stock like Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>), which is also talking about a major spending spree in terms of increasing expenses, also Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) was talking about spending more money.</p> <p>So you have have all these companies building out their AI infrastructures, but Google is up 2.5% after its earnings. Alphabet being Google's parent - that was up 2.5%.</p> <p>I think the difference between Meta and Alphabet in that terms is investor confidence in how they're spending and where that money is gonna go and and the likelihood that it's going to drop to the bottom line sometime in the near future.</p> <p>I think that there's a concern among Meta shareholders that the same kind of spending spree that took place around the metaverse, it's kind of murky the extent to which that contributed to Meta's bottom line.</p> <p>If it goes through another similar process where the money disappears and doesn't really show up anywhere. I'm overstating the situation with the metaverse, but there is a concern that Meta is undisciplined in its approach to these things.</p> <p>There's a lot of enthusiasm within the company for these ventures, and then, they peter out when the next big thing comes along. Whereas, I think there's a feeling that Google is a lot more disciplined in its approach to it.</p> <p>So I think you're seeing this play out in the market in the sense that you're seeing a lot of these large companies talk about their their capital expenditures going up, and it's really a matter of how much investors have confidence that that is eventually going to you're gonna buy profitability at some point down the line.</p> <p><strong>RS: </strong>And anything else to say about Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), Amazon, any other tech points to highlight and or and what other names are you looking at, earnings wise?</p> <p><strong>BS:</strong> I think Apple is kind of a wait and see situation. The stock is basically flat today after its results, though it did set a new high early in the day.</p> <p>It was drifting higher even going into the earnings. And I think people see that the latest quarterly report as being solid, but nothing to push the stock higher.</p> <p>And I think December is going to be the most important one, just because you have the Christmas season, you have the new iPhone rollout that's gonna finally have a full quarter to take hold.</p> <p>So I really think that Apple shareholders are waiting until the next earnings to really see how well the company is executing.</p> <p>Just in terms of a company that we've been talking about the last couple of weeks, they reported earnings last week too. Caterpillar (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAT\" title=\"Caterpillar Inc.\">CAT</a>), which has been a company that I've been fascinated by in the last, I'd say, quarter or so.</p> <p>Traditional machinery maker that's been getting a lot of buzz lately as under the radar AI play. That played out in the company's quarterly report. So even though it's already been up significantly over the last several months, stock rose another 12% after its earnings report.</p> <p>It showed high demand in what it classifies as energy and transportation equipment sector, largely being driven by battery storage and backup generators, just components being used in AI data centers.</p> <p>And so just to kind of put it in context, the energy and transportation revenue within the company grew 17% in Q3. That growth rate was 7% in Q2 and it actually fell 1.7% in Q1. So you're seeing this really quick acceleration in the growth rate in that sector.</p> <p>It generated 8,400,000,000 in Q3. Just as comparison, the construction sector, which I think is what we think of when we think of Caterpillar, was 6,700,000,000 in the quarter.</p> <p>That energy and transportation segment is the biggest contributor to revenue within Caterpillar. I just think it's an interesting interesting stock to track as we continue forward in this capital spending blitz.</p> <p>As Meta announces it's spending more money, as Microsoft announces, Alphabet announces it's spending more money, I think investors are wise to keep in mind how that money spreads through the market and through the economy because that might be, you know, as you say, follow the money as you're you're picking out your investments.</p> <p><strong>RS: </strong>What else would you say, stock wise, that you're focused on or that you've been focused on or investors should be looking at heading into next week?</p> <p><strong>BS: </strong>We have a busy earning season, but lack of the same level of marquee names.</p> <p>I think one interesting one would be Palantir (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR\" title=\"Palantir Technologies Inc.\">PLTR</a>). It's coming out early next week. It's become a high profile AI play, so look for more information there.</p> <p>And then (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) is reporting next week as well. So you have another chip provider, which will which will play into that.</p> <p>On the economic calendar, I think the most interesting report is one that's not going to happen.</p> <p>We're not going to get a jobs report as we would have otherwise expected next week, with the government shutdown reaching, I think, day 31 at this point. Very, very likely that it's going to become the longest shutdown in US history.</p> <p>Not really an end in sight for that. And one of the impacts on Wall Street is the lack of the economic news. So even as the Fed is trying to figure out what the economy is doing, we don't really have the same kind of information.</p> <p>I mean, we're going to get the ADP report, we're going to get JOLTS, but we're not going to get the traditional jobs report.</p> <p>And it seems likely that we might not ever get that data, at least not in the form that we're used to because of the government shutdown, they weren't gathering the data in the same way they were before.</p> <p>So it might not be able to be reconstructed after the fact once we we get the government reopened.</p> <p>So to a certain extent, we're gonna be flying a little blind, at least through a haze, in the near term economically. So it's just a a factor to keep in mind.</p> <p><strong>RS: </strong>And what else should investors be thinking about? We had NVIDIA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) crossing a threshold. Anything you would wanna say about NVIDIA and what that portends for investing in general?</p> <p><strong>BS: </strong>Topped $5 trillion, became the first $5,000,000,000,000 company.</p> <p>It it backed off a little bit, so I think it's hovering just below that level right now. I think the most interesting aspect of that is just how quickly it went from 4,000,000,000,000 to to 5,000,000,000,000.</p> <p>It was hundred and ten days. So between three and four months.</p> <p><strong>RS: </strong>Is that because this time is different, Brian?</p> <p><strong>BS: </strong>That's the question being asked. Right? One of the interesting things about Meta is, Meta's drop took it below the performance of the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" class=\"ticker-link\">SP500</a>).</p> <p>So after falling the the 11% after earnings, the stock is now underperforming the S&amp;P 500. It was overperforming.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GRMN\" title=\"Garmin Ltd.\">GRMN</a></span>) because although the company delivered record <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/9565760\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">results in FY2024</a>, the stock price had<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> increased by 108% within a year's time. This put the valuation at a premium, and at the same time I was cautious of the impact of increased competition within its Fitness segment and continuous losses with the Auto Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) segment. Since then, the stock has declined by about 4.8%, and Garmin has now reported its </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/12808660\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 2025 results</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">. After reviewing its latest Q3 2025 results, my view remains that although Garmin continues to perform well as a business, at current valuation levels, I still see the stock as fairly valued rather than a clear bargain. Therefore, for long-term investors, I think it makes sense to continue holding and waiting for a better price entry point.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618572009021533_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1596\" data-height=\"556\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618572009021533_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"graph\" width=\"640\" height=\"223\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"223\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618572009021533_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618572009021533_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618572009021533_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618572009021533_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618572009021533_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618572009021533_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618572009021533_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618572009021533_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Ten-year stock trend <span>(SeekingAlpha.com)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 2025 earnings and long-term outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the last three financial years, since FY2022, Garmin has been increasing its top and bottom line results consecutively and appears to be on its way to continue to do this in FY2025 after delivering a strong <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834766-garmin-ltd-grmn-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q3 2025.</a> From a business perspective, Garmin’s strength remains its diversification.

The positive cash flow supports the company's ability to reward shareholders and reinvest in the organisation. The company's dividend has been growing over the previous seven years and has a forward annual payout of $3.60. In addition, it also has a share repurchase program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618621327564256_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2192\" data-height=\"206\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618621327564256_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" width=\"640\" height=\"60\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"60\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618621327564256_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618621327564256_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618621327564256_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618621327564256_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618621327564256_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618621327564256_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618621327564256_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618621327564256_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Annual free cash flow <span>(SeekingAlpha.com)</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618574456992722_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2216\" data-height=\"1134\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618574456992722_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" width=\"640\" height=\"328\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"328\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618574456992722_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618574456992722_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618574456992722_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618574456992722_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618574456992722_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618574456992722_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618574456992722_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-17618574456992722_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Balance sheet and cash flow overview <span>(Investor presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At $214.97 per share, Garmin is still a strong company, but the stock looks fairly priced. It has fallen from its high of $259 earlier this month, yet remains up over the past year. Even after the recent drop in stock price, the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 26.94, which is still 12% higher than its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GRMN/valuation/metrics\">five year average.</a> In the table below, we can see that the company continues to run efficiently, it earns healthy profits with a 58.94% gross margin and has a 23.21% net margin. It has also been generating returns over the long run that beat the S&amp;P 500 returns, which is what an investor wants to see. However, growth has started to slow a bit. Revenue is still rising at high double digit growth YoY, but its free cash flow fell by 27.41% as Garmin invests more in new products and operations. Overall, investors are paying a premium for a reliable, well-run business. However, this limits the upside potential for investors looking to add shares at the current price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-1761857509230699_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1586\" data-height=\"1008\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-1761857509230699_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" width=\"640\" height=\"407\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"407\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-1761857509230699_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-1761857509230699_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-1761857509230699_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-1761857509230699_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-1761857509230699_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-1761857509230699_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-1761857509230699_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56428410-1761857509230699_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Quant valuation metrics <span>(SeekingAlpha.com)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Garmin is a large billion dollar company with growing financials, there are still a number of risks to think about as a potential investor. In its Fitness and wearables market, there is fierce competition from giants like Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>) and Samsung (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\">OTCPK:SSNLF</a>), amongst many smaller competitors too. The increase in competition can have a negative impact on the company's profitability and growth potential. We've seen that its Auto OEM segment continues to generate losses, which could negatively impact the company's overall performance if it continues. Another issue is that Garmin is heavily dependent on manufacturing activities in Taiwan running smoothly, with more than <a href=\"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/news/6222153\" rel=\"nofollow\">90% of Garmin’s manufacturing</a> facilities based there. This is a politically sensitive area and could negatively impact the businesses if tensions increase and potentially disrupt operations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final thoughts</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Garmin has reported another strong financial quarter and increased its FY 2025 guideline, it appears to be on its way to improve its top and bottom line for consecutive financial years. It has very diverse business segments, which brings both strengths and weaknesses to the business. Long term investors have seen strong returns over the last decade, significantly beating the S&amp;P 500 over the last decade. However, the stock’s current premium valuation and uncertainties, including increased competition, its underperforming Auto OEM segment, and reliance on a politically sensitive region for manufacturing, keep me cautious. Therefore, I would maintain a Hold rating and wait for a better entry price entry or a clearer visibility on Auto OEM recovery and its position within a growing competitive consumer market.</p>",

It corresponds to Wall Street's outlook that INTC's margins should have bottomed in late 2024, although foundry continues to be a massive margin bleeder, recording almost -55% in segment operating margin in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, encouraging signals from the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4832837-intel-corporation-intc-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4832837-intel-corporation-intc-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">ongoing ramp up of Intel's 18A</a> indicates that the low watermark reached last year should be a thing of the past. Accordingly, Intel had already communicated confident guidance in October, as it telegraphed that <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_a9c76828df1af0b055f7cffea57824a7/intel/news/2025-10-09_Intel_Unveils_Panther_Lake_Architecture_First_AI_1752.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_a9c76828df1af0b055f7cffea57824a7/intel/news/2025-10-09_Intel_Unveils_Panther_Lake_Architecture_First_AI_1752.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Panther Lake</a> (based on the 18A process) had moved into volume production, highlighting the positive cadence implied in its roadmap through 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And of course, I had already enunciated the confidence boost that Intel has been afforded by the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824297-nvidia-and-intel-more-than-just-strategic-messaging-why-both-need-it\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824297-nvidia-and-intel-more-than-just-strategic-messaging-why-both-need-it\" target=\"_blank\">recent Nvidia investment</a> (which the firm expects to close in 2025), while also having the U.S. government's as one of its cornerstone shareholders. Is Intel foundry ready to prove that 1<span>8</span>A could finally be the moment for it to mark a monumental turnaround yet?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, I think it's too early for us to ascertain, but the recent progress augurs well as it works on an x86-based chip with Nvidia, which speaks volumes of the company's sticky x86 architecture ecosystem.

Nevertheless, it does appear that the delayed AI PC ramp could experience a much-needed liftoff from 2026/27, as Intel underscored what every investor arguably wanted to hear: the company is supply constrained. It suggests that Intel's demand dynamics have likely been bolstered, which should help to continue paving the way for its operating margins to recover, even though we should be cautious in trying to ascribe too much optimism this early into the ramp. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Intel: Margin Worries Should Subside, But Don't Bank On A Hockey Stick Inflection</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"3026\" data-height=\"2017\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Intel margins\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911253840073_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Intel margins <span>(TIKR)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the optionality of having Intel foundry be a positive margins driver in the future is alluring, I believe the market won't be fooled into putting too much hopium into the thesis for now, until validated. And with TSMC (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>) being so dominant and relied upon right now by the leading chip designers and the hyperscalers, I don't assess it as reasonable for us (yet) to give the benefit of the doubt about the plausible revival in this segment for now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, while Wall Street forecasts that Intel's CapEx growth should slow down markedly through 2027, the ongoing margin recovery will likely still be driven by the positive outlook in the PC business, while being impeded to a lesser extent due to the ongoing losses in its foundry business. In other words, I believe there's a ceiling on how much operating leverage gains Intel could squeeze out from its unprofitable foundry business, while still relying on a relatively mature PC market to lead the overall recovery. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Buy Or Sell INTC Stock? </h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2088\" data-height=\"1348\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"INTC price chart (long-term, monthly)\" width=\"640\" height=\"413\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51630113-1761911623562395_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">INTC price chart (long-term, monthly) <span>(TradingView)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And when we consider the incredible surge that saw INTC take out levels last observed in early 2024, I think the momentum is clearly too fast and too furious. Obviously, investors are banking on the renewed vigor underlining its narrative, with the investments inked with the U.S. government and Nvidia as the bedrock of its recent gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because, while I concur that Intel's Q3 release has shown us that execution appears to be firmly on the right track amid a relatively sanguine market right now, I'm not sure whether INTC's &gt;90x forward earnings multiple is truly justified. It seems like the market is betting on an even more spectacular restoration of its business fundamentals through 2027, or even the potential gain of crucial foundry customers due to the assumed lack of foundry capacity to deliver the 250GW in data center capacity that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834017-oracle-i-cant-ignore-the-loud-echoes-of-euphoria-now\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834017-oracle-i-cant-ignore-the-loud-echoes-of-euphoria-now\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAI CEO Sam Altman</a> is reportedly gunning for.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While these are certainly pivotal aspects in Intel's incredible turnaround story to salivate over, I think the market could have taken their exuberance way too far, as there's still little for Intel to show for in these businesses at the current moment, or even for the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't anticipate Intel announcing a gargantuan partnership with OpenAI at the moment, while hyperscalers are arguably not going to send their custom chips to Intel to fab, if Nvidia isn't leading the way as a flagship customer to validate Intel's production yields first. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are enough reasons for me to urge investors who didn't manage to join INTC's stellar ascent to sit out, while contemplating other higher-quality setups among its peers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rating: Maintain \"Hold.\" </p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Book value rose 6%. The common share count also increased by 16%. This was a double-barreled benefit to the equity/coverage ratio, which jumped 23%, now sitting at 17x - the highest level in the sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Leverage fell from 8.3x to 7.5x - also good to see. The company has tended to be tactical with its leverage, lowering it when agency spreads fall, as was the case during the quarter. That's a favorable strategy, as it means it won’t be too greedy when agencies are expensive and due for a spread widening. This is why its portfolio performed so well over the COVID quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612174445839.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Systematic Income Preferreds Tool\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"608\" height=\"382\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612174445839.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612174445839.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612174445839.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612174445839.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612174445839.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612174445839.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612174445839.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612174445839.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Systematic Income Preferreds Tool</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the sections below, we highlight some of the concerns that investors have expressed regarding the stock as well as the mREIT preferreds sector more broadly.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. Price Worries</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One concern is that falling short-term rates will bring prices lower as well. DX.PR.C is a floating-rate preferred, and Fed rate cuts will push its dividend lower as well. This is a common concern and is highly intuitive - after all, if the stock is now generating less income, wouldn't investors find it less attractive and, hence, sell it, driving the price lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The short answer here is that short-term rates are not a significant driver of prices of floating-rate assets. This is for two reasons. One, slightly technical, is that short-term rates drive both the cash flows of the floating-rate security as well as the discount factors that are applied to it in generating a risk-neutral price. When short-term interest rates change, the impact of these factors cancels each other out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second reason is more empirical. We can look at the prices of DX.PR.C (which only floated in April of this year) as well as of NLY.PR.F and AGNCN, which have been floating for several years. What we see is that when the Fed cut rates 4 times at the end of 2024, there was no impact on these securities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612073052002878.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Systematic Income Preferreds Tool\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"567\" height=\"364\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612073052002878.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612073052002878.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612073052002878.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612073052002878.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612073052002878.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612073052002878.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612073052002878.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612073052002878.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Systematic Income Preferreds Tool</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, this doesn't mean that floating-rate securities aren't sensitive to anything. Rather, they are sensitive to credit spreads which we can view as either systemic (general risk aversion in credit markets) or something idiosyncratic to the individual asset.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. Redemption Worries</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another persistent concern that investors have is that the stock will be redeemed. This has two components. One, an income-generating asset may be called away just as there are few other attractive opportunities. And two, there may be a small price hit on the redemption. For example, DX.PR.C trades around 2.8% above \"par\" in stripped price terms. This means that an immediate redemption would be a hit of around 2% (after accounting for the required notice period and the coupon accrual in that time). That's real money, even if it is made up in a couple of months of accrual.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">You'd have to be very unlucky to lose money on the stock on a quick redemption after a purchase. That said, it does make sense to time the purchase on a dip (in stripped price terms). However, if the stock is acquired above \"par,\" the longer the position is maintained, the less impactful is the redemption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A common question related to the redemption likelihood is why does DX want to pay 9%+ on the preferred when it can fund itself with repo at less than half the rate? The short answer is that the preferred shouldn't be compared with repo because it's not debt. Rather, it is cheap equity. It should be compared not with the repo rate but with the dividend on common shares, which is considerably higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the greatest determinant of preferreds redemption is the level of credit spread now versus time of issuance. The stock was issued shortly before COVID when high-yield credit spreads were around 3.6% at 5.461% over the unsecured short-term rate (3-month Libor at that point). Today's spreads are around 3%. Arguably, the company's preferred credit spread premium over high-yield bonds is less than it was in 2020. It is a more known entity now, and the stock's equity/preferred coverage is higher. Both of these factors suggest that if the company were to refinance, it would pay a lower credit spread than it did when it issued DX.PR.C.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, we don't know exactly how much less the market would demand than the original spread of 5.461% today, and neither does the company. There are no other DX preferreds, and the stock is pinned-to-par, i.e., the spread it is paying is higher than it would be for a non-callable security, meaning price discovery is challenging. It's likely the market would settle for quite a bit less than the spread of 5.461%, but there is some uncertainty around this. DX would also have to pay something like 2-3% to refinance DX.PR.C, so all of this creates friction to a refinancing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, we wouldn't be shocked if DX.PR.C is redeemed, but it remains unlikely in our view as the lack of redemption on the first call date is a signal that the company is happy to keep the preferred outstanding.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. Yield Worries</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A final worry is that the drop in short-term rates means the yield of the stock is not particularly compelling. After all, who wants to hold a position whose dividend keeps falling?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, individual securities don't exist in isolation, so let's see where the stripped yield of DX.PR.C stands relative to its fixed-rate counterpart - high-yield corporate bonds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612075016816683_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Systematic Income\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"369\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612075016816683_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612075016816683_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612075016816683_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612075016816683_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612075016816683_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612075016816683_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612075016816683_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612075016816683_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Systematic Income</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we chart the historic yield differential between the two, we get the following chart.

One, the relevant yield curve remains unusually flat, meaning floating-rate securities are generating an attractive level of income relative to fixed-rate securities. One element that is often ignored is that short-term rates don't just affect the base rate of floating-rate securities. They obviously affect the entire yield curve as longer-term rates are simply longer-term expectations of short-term rates plus an inflation premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, longer-term rates have already adjusted to the market view of 4-5 more Fed rate cuts to come. And sure, investors can fix that 5-year rate today, but it's not like investors buying fixed-rate bonds can pull a fast one and avoid the rate cuts that are due to affect short-term rates. The coming rate cuts are already baked into long-term rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612181178050725_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Systematic Income\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"369\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612181178050725_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612181178050725_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612181178050725_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612181178050725_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612181178050725_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612181178050725_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612181178050725_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/23/30644215-17612181178050725_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Systematic Income</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And the second reason why the yield of DX.PR.C is and will remain relatively elevated versus high-yield corporate bonds is that the stock is pinned-to-par. Because it is callable, it is not going to move more than 2-3% above \"par\" in stripped price terms. This is because investors don't want to take a hit in case the stock is redeemed. And because this dynamic keeps the price anchored around \"par\", its yield is higher than it would be if the stock were not callable. In short, investors are getting paid a higher yield by virtue of the redemption risk than they would otherwise.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stance and Takeaways</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DX.PR.C remains arguably the best risk/reward in the entire income space at a 9.4% yield (based on today's 3-month term SOFR). This will move lower as the Fed cuts but only very slowly. There is a relatively high call price risk of -2.8%, however, the first call date was in April and the company looks to be in no hurry to redeem it. The stock has been trading a bit above \"par\" for a long while now and will likely remain pinned-to-par unless credit spreads seriously blow out, perhaps doubling from here. This makes it an unusually low-beta asset as well.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For new positions, we would look for the clean price to move towards $25.40 or so where it drops occasionally. Other stocks in the sector have a lower stripped yield and a lower call price hit in case of redemption - not a coincidence. Investors who worry about this should consider a stock like AGNCP, which has a yield of 8.95% (as of today's 3-month term SOFR) but trades below \"par\" in stripped price terms, meaning there is no hit in case of redemption.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a></span>) deserves a Strong Buy rating, and I'll tell you why right away. I've spoken to several analysts and portfolio managers in recent weeks, who are somewhat skeptical of its strong<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> AI spending. Amazon has increased this spending, so I expect even more skepticism or fear that something might break.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see it differently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, that spending corresponds to the current moat, a competitive moat that transforms AWS, retail, and advertising into a single growth engine. This spending can be compared to a wall being quietly built with billions of dollars. A wall that serves as a barrier to entry for potential new players. If we then raise this wall with cash and not leverage, all the better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"602\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Agar Capital, Trading View\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Agar Capital, Trading View</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWS, which has worried everyone recently, has returned to growth at 20%, and believe me, this isn't an isolated case or a stroke of luck, but rather a capacity for expansion and the company's ability to adopt AI solutions that can be monetized on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a>. Extraordinary expenses weighed negatively on the whole, obscuring the real leverage in North America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, there are AI tools like Rufus and the seller suite drive conversions. We're here, we're in the era of AI that monetizes. It's a reality. There are undoubtedly risks. I address them in the dedicated section below, but at the moment I see more upside potential than downside risks. At these levels, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511697-amazon-surges-after-q3-beat-driven-by-aws-ad-growth-offsetting-margin-pressures\">despite the market's post-results reaction</a>, the asymmetry remains favorable. In the long term, I remain positive on the stock and my TP is set within the <em>$269-$286 range.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When the quarterly results were released, I looked at the results, saw the after-hours reaction, and closed everything. I was calm; I had the stock in my portfolio, and I would have calmly dedicated myself to poring over the financial statements. Then Apple arrived, and I was surprised by its market reaction (first a 5% selloff and then an 8% recovery from the low).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I said to myself: we urgently need to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835961-apple-q3-stocks-crash-then-rise-why-rating-upgrade\">understand what's happening</a> with Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>). Amazon, on the other hand, is calm. With a cool head, I started analyzing the stock, and I don't want to bore you with an endless list of financial data. I arrived the next day to write this piece, and in the meantime, even better analysts than me have already analyzed the numbers and highlighted what worked and what didn't. Furthermore, I must say that Seeking Alpha does an excellent job of promptly reporting every company result, so the details are here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The battle for supremacy in the coming years won't be decided by the most beautiful and brilliant software, the one that does the fastest calculations. I feel like I've said that often. The real winners will be energy stocks (especially nuclear, for example) and chipmakers. In this entire context, Amazon is playing its digital industrial game, increasing capacity, dedicated clusters (Trainium2/Rainier), and expanding order visibility. In all of this, many see capex as a problem, but I see a player buying up compute shares before competitors. It's doing what a shark (or whale) should do: eating everything before the others arrive. Sure, you might get upset sometimes, but in the meantime, you'll be full. The others will starve.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'll start by saying that the <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Webslides_Q325.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">published numbers</a>, viewed as they are, don't really tell the story of the quarter.

The backlog is significant, and the new clusters—CPUs, GPUs, memory, storage, high-speed networking—are filling up rapidly, and that's the main point. So, we're talking about a phase in which AI is starting to truly monetize and become part of existing business processes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'd also like to point out another aspect that I found interesting. Did they mention the tariff issue? No reference in calls; not because they don't exist but rather because the model is immune already (local network, stable 3P mix, high-margin ADS).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last point: capex. I mentioned it in the introductory part of the article.

In short, there's been a lot of talk lately. For me, capex is simply a barrier, and I'm happy that companies like Amazon want to defend their technological dominance by spending today and reaping tomorrow. As an investor, I'm happy. Those who build first, monetize first. The only thing I'd ask management is the utilization rate of new clusters and ramp times.

Essentially, the stock continues to rise, while the multiple compresses by about 7%, so the performance was earnings-driven, not re-rating-driven. I don't know if I'm explaining myself, but it's a crucial piece of the puzzle. It's obvious that at these valuations, it's difficult to buy everything in the stock—not even I would—but as long as price growth is driven by earnings growth, there's little to argue about.

Today, AWS consumes, but in two years it will monetize.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To estimate my target price, I start from the company's \"cash\" operating profit, i.e., the consensus 2027 EBITDA, and apply a multiplier of 11–12 times. The blend is consistent with the actual mix (highly profitable AWS/Ads + capital-intensive retail), aligned with the consensus normalization toward 11x in 2027, and conservative as long as AI capex remains at its peak. The result leads to an equity value between $260 and $285 per share, which becomes my reference range, i.e., a $270 base case and a $290–$310 bull case if the next few quarters confirm improving margins and continued growth for AWS and advertising.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon is currently a digital infrastructure that is converting capex into a competitive benefit, not only \"just\" e-commerce.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619242237427483_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"861\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619242237427483_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"549\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619242237427483_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619242237427483_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619242237427483_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619242237427483_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619242237427483_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619242237427483_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619242237427483_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619242237427483_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Amazon</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because FCF compression will take longer than anticipated if the new clusters aren't running at full capacity, power and chips remain the actual question mark.

While in Malaysia this week, President Trump oversaw the signing of an agreement between these two countries over their border dispute that has led to a ceasefire, though no long-term peace has been signed yet. It is a step in the right direction and sets the tone of the rest of the tour.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is no Cambodia ETF that I could find, but the news did do good things for the Thailand ETF. That first steep leg up comes as the announcement of the agreement is made, and then a peak shortly after it's signed (traders \"selling the news\").

Critical mineral MOUs were signed with Malaysia and Thailand, and a potential deal with Brazil was ironed out on the sidelines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Brazil is of importance here because they have been stepping in to provide China with food exports while they have been forgoing US soybeans in protest of trade policy changes. China does not produce as much food as it consumes and so relies on these exports to sustain its population. Initially in April, the US was hoping to use this food export reliance as leverage in trade negotiations with China, but it fell flat when Brazil was able to step in and fill the gap. A deal with Lula will be helpful to Trump because Brazilian cooperation is essential for the China containment policy to work.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1000\" data-height=\"507\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Soybean output to China\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"324\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>American Soybean Association</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Japan Lowers Their Tariffs</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After ASEAN, President Trump headed to Japan, which had just elected its first female Prime Minister, Takaichi. There, the 25% tariff initially put on Japanese goods has been lowered to 15%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This came in exchange for a pledge of a $550 billion investment in the US. I assume that this will come in the form of foreign direct investment made into Japanese companies' operations in the United States, say Toyota (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TM\" title=\"Toyota Motor Corporation\">TM</a>) or Honda (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HMC\" title=\"Honda Motor Co., Ltd.\">HMC</a>). The timeline for this is currently unclear.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notably here, President Trump told Prime Minister Takaichi that the U.S. is \"<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/world/asia/trump-asia-photos.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/world/asia/trump-asia-photos.html\" target=\"_blank\">an ally at the strongest level,</a>\" and to call him if there is \"anything I can do to help Japan.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It remains to be seen what this means in practice, but a lowering of Japanese tariffs was certainly a good start. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4803653-us-japan-trade-deal-mission-accomplished\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4803653-us-japan-trade-deal-mission-accomplished\" target=\"_blank\">Japanese car manufacturers have been eating the tariffs</a> outright since they were announced, likely hoping for an outcome like this that allows them to recover some profit margin without having raised prices on consumers.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">South Korea Makes a Deal</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seoul also had their <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trumps-korea-trade-deal-revives-concerns-about-currency-flight-2025-10-30/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trumps-korea-trade-deal-revives-concerns-about-currency-flight-2025-10-30/\" target=\"_blank\">tariffs drop from 25% to 15%</a>, and they agreed to invest $350 billion into the US. The details here were about as sparse as those in Japan, as one can expect when deals are announced in a flurry like this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because of liquidity concerns with the Won, there were deals made to split the investments up into installments, capped at $20B/year.

Specifically, the Chinese rare earth restrictions are being discussed, as well as American AI chip restrictions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We get gallium and graphite; they get NVIDIA's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) Blackwell.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The truce lasting for one year is problematic because it's just kicking the can down the road, but it allows for the economy to continue in its current shape while we work towards independence in these areas. Without China, there is no American economy that works the way that it currently does. We just import too many important things, specifically magnets and rare earths.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can't just cut them out and say we don't want the rare earths. We need them to keep economic activity at the level it currently is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is why the other trade deals surrounding the meeting with China were so important. Making a trade truce doesn't solve our problem. We still don't have the gallium and graphite long-term, but in the short term, while we build out those deals with allies, we can keep this supply from China coming in smoothly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Whether you agree with this strategy or not is different from whether it's being implemented. It is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The news saw both American and Chinese markets sell off, but the US rebounded, while Chinese markets continued to erase gains made the past week of the tour following the announcement of the truce.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Change in Tone</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What was also interesting surrounding this were the leaders' comments about each other, where they discussed each other as peers and rivals depending on who they were speaking to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It reminds me of when China began to join the WTO and ascended to the world stage in the 1990s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In May 1993,<a href=\"https://china.usc.edu/node/19959\" rel=\"noopener noopener\" title=\"https://china.usc.edu/node/19959\" target=\"_blank\"> President Bill Clinton said</a>: \"We are prepared to build a more cooperative relationship with China and wish to work with China as an active member of the international community.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In July 1993, <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G3oFtynW4AAwnkh?format=jpg&amp;name=large\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G3oFtynW4AAwnkh?format=jpg&amp;name=large\" target=\"_blank\">President Jiang Zemin said</a>: \"For the foreseeable future, the United States will remain our primary adversary...\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To those that were watching closely, it was a clear sign of an asymmetry in our relationship. That's the same asymmetry that Trump is trying to address now, 30 years later.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That asymmetry is gone now, as both leaders talk openly about being both peers and rivals, not just one or the other. It was clear that neither side felt like they secured the win they wanted, which is standard in negotiating, but is not how anyone wants their negotiations to end. For now, we have a truce, while we build independence and work with our allies to create a strategic supply chain that doesn't include a country that considers us its primary adversary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That quote is from 1993, but if you had told me President Xi said it following this meeting, I would believe you. So would most analysts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, there is an impetus for the United States to secure itself strategically. That includes securing strong relationships with our partners and containing our adversaries, both militarily and economically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My view of the situation is still that rare-earth firms continue to benefit despite the trade truce, which saw a sell-off in some rare-earth stocks. The overall macro situation for them remains mostly unchanged; it is overwhelmingly bullish from my view. The US and its allies need to secure these supply chains, regardless of how long they have access to them via China. Relying on China just isn't sustainable long-term, and so the investment into these firms will likely continue at full speed once the government re-opens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Much of the foreign investment promised out of Japan and South Korea will go to strategic supply chains as well, like shipbuilding and domestic manufacturing. This will take time, and it is unclear what the full road of investment looks like. I am eager for more details.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thanks for reading.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FORM\" title=\"FormFactor, Inc.\">FORM</a></span>) reported very positive numbers, which sent its shares over 24% for the day, on the back of improved operational performance and a return to growth in sequential sales. I wanted to take a look at the numbers in more<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> detail and give some comments on the outlook and why I am not particularly itching to start a position.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806987-formfactor-q2-earnings-the-future-looks-much-better-if-everything-goes-well\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806987-formfactor-q2-earnings-the-future-looks-much-better-if-everything-goes-well\" target=\"_blank\">Since the last time</a> I covered the company, it has done tremendously as its share price doubled in just three months. I said that the future looks very good, but I held off from giving it a buy rating as I had some reservations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>By The Numbers</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Starting from the top, sales topped $202.6m, down 2.6% y/y, but slightly beat analysts’ estimates by $2.6m. DRAM probe cards grew double-digits and were the main contributor to the performance that could have been much worse. The systems segment also experienced growth due to higher initial volume production of co-packaged optics. The company began to see some sequential growth, which is good to see. Looking at the breakdown of sales in a bit more detail, we can see that DRAM sales were clearly the best performer this quarter, while Foundry &amp; Logic saw some softness within the Probe Cards Segment.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2032\" data-height=\"1060\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FORM IR\" width=\"640\" height=\"334\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FORM IR</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of regional breakdown, South Korea seems to be the standout in terms of demand for the company’s products, while China is starting to show some action and is slowly coming back up.

Q3 Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.33, beating consensus by $0.08. A decent margin. The company’s GAAP margins saw a particularly strong improvement of around 250bps sequentially to almost 40%, while non-GAAP GM came in at 41%. These improvements can be attributed to overall operational efficiencies, cost controls, and labor reductions. The company’s non-GAAP operating margins improved significantly since Q2’25 by around 270bps, leading to the net income increase to $15.66m from $9.09m in Q2, while non-GAAP bottom line came in at $25.68m.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the company’s financial situation, FORM finished the quarter with around $97.6m in cash and equivalents, as well as $168.3m in marketable securities, against $11m in long-term debt. That is essentially no debt, since the company’s liquidity far outweighs the obligations on debt. The company’s balance sheet continues to improve, and I don’t see anything wrong with it. It’s quite strong. The company is flush with cash and will no doubt easily survive any major downturns in the economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of these results, management was kind enough to provide us with some updated numbers for the next quarter. The management now expects to make around $210m in sales, which comes in above the estimates of $199.6m, while adjusted EPS should be around $0.35, which is also well above consensus estimates of $0.29, with gross margin forecasted to reach 42%.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"857\" data-height=\"75\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FORM 8K\" width=\"640\" height=\"56\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FORM 8K</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the results were decent. Sales are beginning to pick up, while the company’s operations have improved significantly in just one quarter. On top of that, the company raised guidance for the rest of the year, coupled with a beat on top and bottom lines, investors sent the company’s shares up over 24% for the day. I think this sort of reaction was a bit too much. Sure, the operational improvements are nice, but top-line growth was still non-existent y/y, but my best guess is that due to a decent sequential improvement, investors believe the company is ready to return to growth. Also, I believe investors are very positive about the company’s DRAM and HBM performance, which are critical for AI. Some analysts raised the company’s price target significantly following the results, due to improved margins, assigning a PT of $44 from $23. A massive bump, which no doubt helped fuel this rally. The PT is still much lower than what the company trades at, but such a boost is telling.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Comments On The Outlook</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management has been doing a tremendous job of getting the company’s efficiency and profitability to where they used to be just one year ago, and I believe those numbers will be improved upon over the next few quarters, especially if the demand for everything AI-related continues the way it has. And I am very certain that this AI hype is not going anywhere for at least another few years. The reason I think so is because the main players in the AI/data center space have all reported their earnings over the last two days, and all of which have not only raised their capex spend from previous estimates for the rest of the year, but also provided not-so-cryptic messaging about the next year’s capex to be significantly higher than 2025’s. So, this means there is going to be a lot of money thrown around still in this AI race, and this only means that companies that have anything to do with AI and data centers will see some sort of a boost for much longer. The stock has already more than doubled since the lows in April, and with the recent results and guidance numbers, investors expect this growth to continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More demand means fixed cost per unit can be spread out more efficiently, leading to higher margins overall, as long as pricing remains stable or decreases. Hype trends like AI are going to continue to drive demand for the company’s products; it’s just a matter of the company actually capturing more of that demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company may not see a lot of growth right now, even if hyperscalers are shoveling billions of dollars into AI. However, due to longer lead times and being somewhat of a specialized semiconductor testing company, I expect growth to come in eventually, which is why, I believe, is the reason we saw such a jump in share price <span>on October 30</span>. Investors are already pricing it in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Closing Comments</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For this reason, I am going to maintain my hold rating, as I believe the growth has been more or less priced in after this massive jump in share price today. I can see the management is doing a great thing regarding improved efficiency and profitability; however, such a jump in price can only mean that the future improvements have been accounted for by investors. Unless the company surprises us even more over the next few quarters, like showing a 50% growth in sales. That would be impressive and would warrant having another look at it in a lot more detail.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, my exposure to everything AI is already too high; therefore, I am going to sit this one out.</p>",

Although revenue disappointed relative to even that pretty low bar, the overall results showed an improving margin on just slightly growing sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The results reported for the third quarter indicate that Verizon is becoming more profitable over time, and indeed, that is the long-term trend as well. In the table below, you can see that since year-end 2021, VZ’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ/income-statement\">gross profit </a>has increased from $77.3 billion to $81.49 billion, while its revenue has increased from $133.6 billion to $137 billion. This indicates that the company’s gross profit margin has increased from 57.8% to 59.4%—a non-negligible increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Verizon gross profit growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"568\" height=\"331\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Verizon gross profit growth <span>(Seeking Alpha Quant)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, we have a considerable increase in Verizon’s gross profit, as well as its gross profit margin, yet VZ stock is actually down 30% over a five-year period.

According to Seeking Alpha Quant, VZ trades at a mere 8.3 times earnings, contributing to an A- valuation rating. This combined with increasing revenue and gross margins would appear to indicate cheapness.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, none of the above means anything if Verizon is destined to have its financial fortunes crumble tomorrow. We always need to attempt to gauge a company’s forward prospects before saying that it is truly cheap. I’ll explore that matter in detail in a later section. For now, I will simply point to the fact that the company has $383 billion in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ/balance-sheet\">assets</a>–only 5.9% of which are goodwill–and $3.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. This is a treasure chest the company can draw on to outlast competitors in times of stress and which can be used to make new investments. These simple facts bode well for Verizon’s future prospects–though obviously we need to look at much more than just balance sheet health before we can fully render a verdict on the matter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another thing investors will want to know about Verizon stock following its third quarter release is its suitability as a dividend stock. Before VZ’s earnings came out, the company had a healthy payout ratio, with Seeking Alpha Quant <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ/dividends/scorecard\">confirming it at 57.6%</a> for the trailing 12-month period. With VZ having posted positive earnings growth in the third quarter, that ratio is presumably coming down over time. So, VZ’s 7%-yielding dividend is getting better covered by earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1182\" data-height=\"474\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"VZ dividend summary\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"257\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">VZ dividend summary <span>(Seeking Alpha Quant)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I last covered Verizon stock, I rated it a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4652210-verizon-stands-to-gain-from-falling-inflation\">Buy</a> because of the improvements I saw in its operations. Since then, the company has grown and increased its profitability, while its stock has decreased in price. The underlying value would appear to be greater now. So, I am increasing my rating to Strong Buy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings Recap</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Verizon’s recent <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-reports-3q-2025-earnings-reiterates-full-year-financial-guidance\" rel=\"nofollow\">earnings release</a> mostly exceeded analyst expectations, boasting the following metrics:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>$33.8 billion in revenue, up 1.6% year over year (miss by $400 million).</p></li> <li><p>$1.17 in reported EPS, up 50%.</p></li> <li><p>$1.21 in adjusted EPS, up 1.6% (beat by $0.02).</p></li> <li><p>$28 billion in nine-month operating cash flow, up 5.6%.</p></li> <li><p>$15.8 billion in nine-month free cash flow (FCF), up 8.9%.</p></li> <li><p>$12.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA, up 2.4%.</p></li> <li><p>$21 billion in wireless service revenue, up 2.1%.</p></li> <li><p>$5.6 billion in wireless equipment revenue, up 5.2%.</p></li> <li><p>261,000 wireless net additions.</p></li> <li><p>306,000 broadband net additions.</p></li> <li><p>Guidance for 1% to 3% EPS growth.</p></li> <li><p>Guidance for $19.5 billion to $20.5 billion in full-year FCF.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the headline metrics were all pretty satisfactory. Additionally, there were some nice tidbits of information away in the release as well, for example:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>There were 61,000 internet net additions in the quarter, the best result seen in two years.</p></li> <li><p>Postpaid average revenue per account (ARPA) improved 2%.</p></li> <li><p>The company had 13.2 million total broadband customers by the end of the quarter.</p></li> <li><p>It also delivered a $6.7 billion reduction in net debt.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These additional facts go to show that Verizon is not only beating earnings expectations but also improving its financial condition as well as customer totals. It looks like a pretty good picture.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Future Prospects</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having looked at VZ’s most recent periodic performance, we can now attempt to gauge its future prospects. I already touched on this in the introduction, when I wrote that the company has a lot of assets and cash with which to invest. That is one competitive edge that could drive future growth for VZ. Another, less measurable (but still important) edge the company has is a strong focus on <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/verizon-boosts-annual-forecast-demand-premium-plans-tax-law-benefit-2025-07-21/\" rel=\"nofollow\">premium plans</a>. While telcos in general don’t enjoy much <a href=\"https://www.iotinsider.com/iot-insights/technical-insights/the-true-cost-of-falling-telecoms-prices/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pricing power</a>, with service prices declining long-term, there are segments of the telco market where suppliers have more power. One of those is the “ultra high speed” segment, where unlimited 5G plans can often come at a significant cost to consumers. Customers are often willing to pay up for such plans. This is particularly the case with customers who <em>need</em> constant high-speed internet, such as gamers and business owners. Verizon is investing heavily in servicing such consumers, buying up fibre optic companies to help serve them.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next up, we can look at the multiples that Verizon trades at. At today’s price, VZ is a pretty cheap-looking stock, trading at 8.3 times earnings, 1.2 times sales, and 1.56 times book. You can see more multiples in the image below, courtesy of Seeking Alpha Quant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1048\" data-height=\"1240\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"VZ valuation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"757\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">VZ valuation <span>(Seeking Alpha Quant)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One multiple that looks very intriguing here is the PEG ratio, which indicates truly extreme cheapness after factoring in growth. I don’t think that VZ’s earnings growth rate is going to remain at 103% forever–the company doesn’t have the top-line growth to support that–but it should be positive. So, I expect VZ to continue having a respectable PEG ratio, unless its price rises dramatically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for what VZ is worth in terms of discounted cash flows:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I found from Capital IQ data that analysts estimate VZ’s cost of equity at 7% and its long-term earnings growth rate at 1.3%. Using these estimates as well as Seeking Alpha Quant’s estimate of VZ’s FCF per share, I got a $85.79 fair value estimate.

These include:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p><strong>Competition.</strong> There are many telcos in the United States, and some, such as AT&amp;T Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T\" title=\"AT&amp;T Inc.\">T</a>) are quite strong and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T/balance-sheet\">well funded</a>. They could bring competition to Verizon that puts pressure on its margins.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Little pricing power.</strong> Verizon does not appear to have much pricing power, as evidenced by the fact that it <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/verizon-posts-higher-subscriber-loss-price-hikes-competition-2025-04-22/\" rel=\"nofollow\">experienced subscriber loss</a> when it attempted to hike prices earlier this year.</p></li> <li><p><strong>High costs.</strong> Telco services are capital-intensive owing to the fact that they run on large amounts of heavy infrastructure. This typically requires them to borrow lots of money, although Verizon has been paying down its debt in recent quarters.</p></li> </ol> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The above risks are worth keeping in mind. However, Verizon’s cheapness more than adequately compensates for them, making the company's stock a buy in my books.</p>",
