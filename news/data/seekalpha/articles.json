Both companies also aim to tap the massive CapEx spending on AI data-centers that are being driven by the cash-rich hyperscalers (Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), and Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>)) as well as neo-cloud vendors and up-and-coming companies like META (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), Oracle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>), and OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>), which are also arguably becoming hyperscalers in their own right.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see from the graphic below from <a href=\"https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/artificial-intelligence-chipset-market-237558655.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Markets-and-Markets</a> research, what's at stake here is literally $100's of billions of dollars in AI chip's revenue just over the next few years - a market that is expected to grow at a 20%+ CAGR through 2029:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"909\" data-height=\"480\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AI Chip Market Size\" width=\"640\" height=\"338\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"338\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617534605792446_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Markets-and-Markets</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, these two companies arguably have different strategies. AMD has been focused on competing head-on with Nvidia in the high-end processor market typically used for training large language models, or LLMs, and making these processors available to most any company that wants to buy them. Broadcom, on the other hand, has taken a different path by focusing on developing partnerships with only a handful of high-volume hyperscalers to co-develop application and AI/ML algorithm optimized XPU designs that are sold only to those specific customers and which are typically more often used for inferencing (see <em><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4820577-broadcom-the-secret-sauce-behind-its-booming-xpu-business\">Broadcom: The 'Secret Sauce' Behind Its Booming XPU Business</a></em>). Some investors think I might be splitting hairs here, but these are important distinctions between AMD and Broadcom.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regardless of the strategy taken, both AMD and Broadcom hope to deliver strong total returns for shareholders by providing more cost-efficient solutions than can be provided by the more expensive GPUs sold by market-leading Nvidia. (As an aside, AMD CEO Lisa Su is a <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/12/18/lisa-su-amd-ceo-share-price-jensen-huang/\" rel=\"nofollow\">distant cousin</a> of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang). Both companies should also benefit from the fact that many customers often cannot get the volume of Nvidia GPUs that they would prefer to be allocated to them instead of to their competitors. From that perspective, both AMD &amp; Broadcom are well-positioned to benefit from both of these dynamics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that as background, let's compare the two companies on a financial metrics basis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Basic Investment Metrics Comparisons</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The table below compares some of the most important financial and stock metrics (courtesy of Yahoo Finance and Seeking Alpha) that most any investor would consider before investing in either AMD and/or Broadcom:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td> </td> <td><strong>AMD</strong></td> <td><strong>Broadcom</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Market-Cap</strong></td> <td>$418.0 billion</td> <td>$1.79 trillion</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>TTM P/E</strong></td> <td>153.3x</td> <td>96.6x</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Forward P/E</strong></td> <td>65.6x</td> <td>55.3x</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Dividend/Yield</strong></td> <td>N/A</td> <td>$2.36/0.63%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Q2 FY25 Revenue</strong></td> <td>$7.7 billion (+30% YOY)</td> <td>$15.0 billion (+20% YOY)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Q2 Gross Margin</strong></td> <td>40%</td> <td>68%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Q2 GAAP EPS</strong></td> <td>$0.54/share</td> <td>$1.03/share</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Q2 Net Margin</strong></td> <td>11.3%</td> <td>33.1%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Q2 Free-Cash-Flow</strong></td> <td>$1.18 billion (+169% YOY)</td> <td>$6.41 billion (+44% YOY)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Q2 FCF Margin</strong></td> <td>15.0%</td> <td>42.7%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Q2 Free-Cash-Flow/Share</strong></td> <td>$0.72/share</td> <td>$1.33/share</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>ROE (TTM)</strong></td> <td>4.70%</td> <td>27.08%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Total Cash</strong></td> <td>$5.87 billion</td> <td>$11.11 billion</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Debt-to-Equity</strong></td> <td>6.51%</td> <td>166.03%</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">References: <a href=\"https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1257/amd-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">AMD Q2 Report</a>, <a href=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-inc-announces-second-quarter-fiscal-year-2025-financial\" rel=\"nofollow\">Broadcom Q2 Report</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see from the chart, Broadcom is a member of the $1 trillion market-cap club and has a market capitalization of 4x+ that of AMD.

And while the current 0.63% yield might not be a consideration to invest in the company today, long-term Broadcom shareholders know that the yield is only \"low\" because of the stock's excellent price appreciation over the past decade. In addition, note that Broadcom easily covers its annual dividend obligation (and then some ...) with the FCF generated in only two quarters. My point here is that I fully expect Broadcom to announce another 10% (or possibly larger) dividend increase in December.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regardless, either way you look at it, Broadcom is superior to AMD when it comes to a paying a dividend &amp; dividend growth (AMD currently does not pay a dividend).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a financial basis, perhaps the biggest difference between the two companies is with respect to their margin and free-cash-flow profiles. As you can see in the chart above, in Q2, <em>Broadcom's gross margin was a full 28 percentage points higher than AMD</em>. This gets back to Broadcom CEO Hock Tan's vision and strategy to focus the company only on the best high-margin, high-growth opportunities. As I pointed out in one of my most highly read Seeking Alpha articles, Hock Tan would rather threaten to exit a business than operate one delivering puny margins (see <em><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4569543-broadcom-ceo-shakedown-apple-chips\">CEO Shakedown: Hock Tan Vs Tim Cook</a></em> - a Seeking Alpha Editor's Pick).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It may also be indicative of the difficulty AMD may be having when it comes to competing directly with Nvidia (or even Broadcom ...) and the relative discounting it may have to offer in order to close order flow on its processors. On the other hand, with greater adoption of its processors, AMD may turn out to be a margin expansion story, in which case I might change my outlook on the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The margin difference, of course, plays a dominant role in terms of the two companies' free-cash-flow profiles. AMD generated $1.18 billion of free cash flow in Q2, which was up nicely on a YOY basis (+169%). From a revenue perspective, that equates to a FCF margin of 15% and $0.72/share. Broadcom generated $6.41 billion of FCF in Q2 (5.4x that of AMD) with a FCF margin of 42.7%. And while Broadcom's FCF margin was almost 3x that of AMD, on a historical basis, a 42.7% FCF margin is actually quite low for Broadcom and has much to do with its relatively recent and large acquisition of VMWare ($69 billion of cash+debt), which closed in November of 2023. Once again, the advantage in financial returns goes to Broadcom, which has an TTM ROE of 27.1% as compared to AMD's ROE of 4.7%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance Sheet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a balance sheet perspective, the advantage goes <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD/balance-sheet\">to AMD</a>, which has a debt-to-equity ratio of only 6.51% as compared <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO/balance-sheet\">to Broadcom's</a> 166.03%. Indeed, as of Q2, Broadcom, was still carrying $62.8 billion of long-term debt (to go with its $11.1 billion of cash), primarily as a result of the VMWare acquisition. Broadcom has traditionally paid down M&amp;A related debt faster than it has so far done with VMWare, but that is because Broadcom has been more focused on investing quite heavily to take advantage of the tremendous growth opportunities it has with its XPU business with the hyperscalers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Diversity</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While it may be a stretch to call AMD a one-trick pony, it has clearly become a processor-centric company. On the other hand, and as I have been writing for years on Seeking Alpha, Broadcom is arguably the global-leader in high-speed networking and, in Q2, generated 44% of total revenue from its high-margin Infrastructure Software Segment:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617586470086644.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Broadcom Q2 Segment Results\" width=\"540\" height=\"203\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"540\" data-height=\"203\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617586470086644.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617586470086644.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617586470086644.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617586470086644.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617586470086644.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617586470086644.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617586470086644.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/173432-17617586470086644.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Broadcom</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see, in Q2, Broadcom generated $6.6 billion in high-margin revenue from its Infrastructure (Enterprise) Software Segment. As compared to AMD, this is important for two different reasons:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Broadcom has a strategic partnership with Nvidia that enables its VMWare Cloud Foundation (\"VCF\") to offer full-stack support for Nvidia's GPUs. This was very likely a significant headwind for AMD processor adoption amongst potential customers that also want to use VCF. As a result, in August, AMD agreed to collaborate with Broadcom to enable VCF to support its processors as well (almost two years after Broadcom &amp; Nvidia inked its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4657569-broadcom-a-201-stock-split-is-quite-likely\">strategic partnership</a>). At this point, Broadcom's VMWare has excellent flexibility because it can support Nvidia GPUs, AMD's processors, and - of course - Broadcom's own hyperscaler XPUs.</li> <li>Broadcom's Infrastructure Software Segment generates strong annual recurring revenue (\"ARR\"). This lowers the risk of investing in Broadcom stock, while also increasing the market's valuation of the company as a whole.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Once again: the advantage on software clearly goes to Broadcom.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meantime, Broadcom's high-speed networking product-line offerings are arguably and consistently the highest-quality, highest-bandwidth, and lowest latency in the industry. Again: this is a huge advantage that Broadcom has over AMD.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I say that because note that <em>Broadcom's XPUs, Infrastructure Software, and high-speed networking business are synergistic.</em> That is, a customer can come to Broadcom and get a fully integrated package of AI data-center solutions across processing, networking, and software. Again: a huge advantage to Broadcom moving forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AMD reports its Q3 earnings <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD/earnings\">on November 4th</a>, while Broadcom doesn't report until <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO/earnings\">December 11th</a>. December is very late to report Q3 results, but after years of owning AVGO stock, trust me when I say that it is always worth the wait for AVGO's earnings reports.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current consensus analysts' estimates per Yahoo Finance are:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>AMD: Q3 Revenue of $8.75 billion (+28.3% YOY), EPS=$1.17/share.</li> <li>Broadcom: Q3 Revenue of $17.45 billion (+24.2% YOY), EPS=$1.87/share.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see, both companies are expected to continue growing revenue at an impressive pace. On a sequential basis, if AMD hits consensus estimates, it would equate to EPS growth of +116.7% as compared to Q2, while for Broadcom, it would equate to 81.6% EPS growth QoQ. That being the case, in the near-term, it appears that AMD is growing a bit faster from a revenue and EPS perspective, but of course, it is starting from a significantly lower base (i.e. the law of large numbers). Regardless, investors should be keeping a keen eye out for margin: are AMD and Broadcom exhibiting margin expansion? Can AMD close the big gap between it and Broadcom when it comes to net-margin, and it's very different free-cash-flow profile? Time will tell, but I certainly have my doubts, and I am much more confident that Broadcom will, once again, deliver the goods.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meantime, and while there have been a plethora of much-reported orders, I am still waiting for Broadcom to announce that Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>) has placed an order for XPUs, adding another tier-1 hyperscaler to its stable of XPU customers - which already includes Google, META, Byte Dance, and <a href=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/openai-and-broadcom-announce-strategic-collaboration-deploy-10\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenAI</a>. Note that all of these are significant Broadcom high-speed networking customers as well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">OpenAI Deals &amp; CapEx Trends</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earlier this month, AMD and OpenAI inked a multi-year multi-generational strategic partnership to deploy <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-amd-strategic-partnership/\" rel=\"nofollow\">6 GW of AMD GPUs</a>. The initial phase of the partnership will see 1 GW of AMD Instinct MI450 Series GPUs deployed starting in the 2H 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A week later, Broadcom <a href=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/openai-and-broadcom-announce-strategic-collaboration-deploy-10\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> an even larger strategic collaboration with OpenAI that will deploy 10 GW of OpenAI designed XPUs. The multi-year deal will see the two companies working together to deliver combined accelerators and networking systems for large-scale next-generation AI clusters using Broadcom's Ethernet-based scale-up and scale-out technology. Broadcom's deliverables will start in the 2H of 2026 and will consist of racks of AI accelerator &amp; network systems. The deal is expected to complete by the end of 2029. This deal shows one of the inherent advantages Broadcom has over AMD: the ability to package high-speed networking gear along with XPU accelerators in order to own more of the entire AI data-center architecture.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regardless of which company you like better (AMD or Broadcom), one thing that both of them share with Nvidia is what company makes all these cutting-edge AI processor chips: Taiwan Semiconductor (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>). That being the case, and considering TSM currently trades at a significant valuation discount to both AMD &amp; Broadcom (TTM P/E=33.9x, forward P/E=29.1x), one could make a good argument that TSMC may be the better investment here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of earnings, Google and META just released their Q3 results (see <a href=\"https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/2025q3-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_news/Meta-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Results-2025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, respectively). As I predicted in my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830520-alphabet-the-ai-leader-openai-is-still-chasing\">recent Seeking Alpha article</a> \"<em>Google: The AI Leader OpenAI Is Still Chasing (But Will Never Catch\")</em>, Google delivered a huge beat and its first $100 billion dollar quarter:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Google Advertising Revenue: $74.182 billion (+12.7% YOY).</li> <li>Google Cloud Revenue: $15.157 billion (+33.5% YOY).</li> <li>EPS of $2.87/share (+35.4% YOY).</li> <li>Free-cash-flow: $24.461 billion (despite a huge CapEx spend).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Google Search, YouTube, Google subscriptions, and Google Cloud each delivered double-digit growth in Q3 - all driven by Google's Gemini and Infrastructure AI. So much for the popular narrative that OpenAI its ChatGPT chatbot would somehow \"kill Google Search.\" right? Why am I mentioning this here? Because Google is a major XPU customer of Broadcom (GOOG calls them \"TPUs\") and GOOG announced a further increase in FY25 CapEx from an estimated $85 billion in the <a href=\"https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/2025q2-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q2 report</a> to a mid-point of $92 billion, or an incremental increase of $7 billion, in the Q3 report released today. And you can bet that a significant chunk of that increase will likely be headed to Broadcom for TPUs and high-speed networking equipment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Likewise, META - another Broadcom XPU customer - had very strong Q3 results and also increased its FY25 CapEx guidance to a midpoint of $71 billion from the previous midpoint of $69 billion. META also <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510953-meta-anticipates-capex-dollar-growth-to-rise-notably-in-2026-with-ai-investments\">said</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>CapEx dollar growth will be notably larger in 2026 than 2025. We also anticipate total expenses will grow at a significantly faster percentage rate than 2025, with growth primarily driven by infrastructure costs.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My point here is that the hyperscalers that are Broadcom XPU and high-speed networking equipment customers are demonstrating strong growth, doing very well, and significantly increasing their CapEx budgets - of which a significantly allocation will quite likely be spent on Broadcom's XPU and high-speed networking products. This bodes very well for Broadcom's near-term upcoming earnings report on December 11th and the company's earnings well into 2026 and beyond.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary &amp; Conclusions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both AMD and Broadcom are clearly operating in the right market at the right time. However, from a financial perspective, Broadcom's margin and free-cash-flow profiles are superior when compared to AMD's. In addition, Broadcom has two businesses (High-speed Networking &amp; Infrastructure Software) in which AMD is a relative no-show. That is a huge advantage to Broadcom when it comes to packaging all three of its offerings (i.e. XPU processor, high-speed networking equipment, and VMWare software) for customers who prefer to deal with one vendor when designing its AI data-center architecture.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When you also consider that <em>Broadcom stock is currently selling at a significant valuation discount to AMD</em>, Broadcom wins this showdown by a mile in my opinion. That being the case, if I owned AMD shares (I do not) I would probably SELL them and BUY more Broadcom (full-disclosure: I do own Broadcom stock).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'll end with a 5-year total returns chart of Broadcom versus AMD and add the broad market averages as represented by (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VOO\" title=\"Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF\">VOO</a>) and (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust ETF\">QQQ</a>) for the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100, respectively:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_6b903b171a20d2bf0e927c3bf6c991eb.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_6b903b171a20d2bf0e927c3bf6c991eb.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_6b903b171a20d2bf0e927c3bf6c991eb.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_6b903b171a20d2bf0e927c3bf6c991eb.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_6b903b171a20d2bf0e927c3bf6c991eb.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_6b903b171a20d2bf0e927c3bf6c991eb.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_6b903b171a20d2bf0e927c3bf6c991eb.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_6b903b171a20d2bf0e927c3bf6c991eb.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_6b903b171a20d2bf0e927c3bf6c991eb.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see from the graphic, Broadcom has been the clear out-performer of the chosen companies and ETFs.

The common shares have dipped markedly from their 2025 highs, mirroring a broad BDC sell-off catalyzed by fears that the Fed's dovish pivot to cutting rates would spark widespread dividend cuts. This was overlaid with the dual collapse of First Brands Group and Tricolor to spark systemic credit fears that pulled private credit into its malaise and made selling BDCs into a tradable event. Critically, there was very little exposure to these two junk-rated companies in the highly cyclical automobile sector companies across publicly traded BDCs, with Prospect Capital (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSEC\" title=\"Prospect Capital Corporation\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">PSEC</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) and small-cap Great Elm Capital (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GECC\" title=\"Great Elm Capital Corporation\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">GECC</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) forming the only two securities in the space with material exposure.</span></p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_ebb978437313ae1b94703329dd153d96.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_ebb978437313ae1b94703329dd153d96.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_ebb978437313ae1b94703329dd153d96.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_ebb978437313ae1b94703329dd153d96.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_ebb978437313ae1b94703329dd153d96.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_ebb978437313ae1b94703329dd153d96.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_ebb978437313ae1b94703329dd153d96.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_ebb978437313ae1b94703329dd153d96.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_ebb978437313ae1b94703329dd153d96.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ARCC is the largest BDC by market cap, with a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834240-ares-capital-2025-q3-results-earnings-call-presentation\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834240-ares-capital-2025-q3-results-earnings-call-presentation\" target=\"_blank\">$28.7 billion</a> portfolio at fair value as of the end of the fiscal 2025 third quarter.

This is lower than peers, and is somewhat of a plus in an environment where yields are being pulled down by the Fed. It comes as ARCC ramps up gross commitments to maintain investment portfolio growth. Gross commitments were <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509151-ares-capital-in-charts-interest-income-from-investments-dips-yy-dividend-income-drops\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509151-ares-capital-in-charts-interest-income-from-investments-dips-yy-dividend-income-drops\" target=\"_blank\">$3.92 billion</a> during the third quarter, up a material 53% sequentially and roughly flat versus gross commitments a year ago. It was set against exits of $2.63 billion for positive net commitments of $1.3 billion during the third quarter. ARCC is aligned with the BDC camp that has sped up originations to counter falling rates.

ARCC had 1% of its portfolio at fair value on non-accrual status as of the end of the third quarter. This was down 20 basis points sequentially but up from 0.6% a year ago. This is still well within a prudent historical range, which renders the selling off seen recently as relatively unhinged. This sell-off would drive the commons to the April \"Liberation Day\" tariff lows. However, it's becoming increasingly clear that the dual failures were isolated idiosyncratic risk events, and their extrapolation to the broader private credit space was unnecessary.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1560\" data-height=\"1102\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Ares Capital Fiscal 2025 Third Quarter Investment Backlog\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"452\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/41871776-17617919073456607_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ares Capital Fiscal 2025 Third Quarter Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ARCC's investment backlog at the end of the third quarter was $3 billion, with the BDC now clearly pushing for a larger allocation to first lien credit, as this formed 85% of its backlog. NII per share is currently covering its dividend by 100%, an exact ratio that leaves very little room for NII to dip in future quarters. This coverage came as its net asset value per share of $20.01 grew by $0.12 versus its year-ago comp. ARCC is a hold at its current level.</p>",

Aside from McDonald’s Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD\" title=\"McDonald's Corporation\">MCD</a>), DoorDash, Inc.

And while I would still call Starbucks a great long-term investment, I see downside risk in the short term. Depending on the question if the United States will enter a recession and how steep the recession will be, a valuation multiple of 30 or higher might not be justified and Starbucks could decline rather steep (especially as earnings per share and free cash flow will also contract in such a scenario). Looking at the Great Financial Crisis is demonstrating how steep Starbucks could fall.</p> <p>But over the long run, Starbucks is probably fairly valued and can be seen as a solid investment at this point. It is not a bargain, but probably also not overvalued.“</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back then, I was already cautious and pointed out that we are still dealing with a great business and a potential long-term investment. But I also made clear we should not ignore the short-term risks. At this point, I would not only classify the risks as rather short-to-mid-term but also see the risks as the bigger issue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since my last article was published, Starbucks has declined about 14% (this was written before market open) and clearly underperformed the overall market and a declining stock price is in most cases shifting the risk-reward ratio towards a more bullish opinion. However, due to the continuous struggles of Starbucks (exemplified by the underwhelming quarterly results), the still high valuation multiples the stock is trading for and the risks looming on the horizon, I would be even more cautious about Starbucks as an investment. In the following article, I will explain why I actually sold my Starbucks position a few months ago and why I see the stock being a “Hold” at best.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Valuation Multiples</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest problem for Starbucks investors is still the high valuation multiples. At the time of writing, Starbucks is still trading for 36.4 times earnings per share and 42.5 times free cash flow. Without much doubt, these are extremely high valuation multiples.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a265fb98b99e43f3c12586be5d9b178f.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a265fb98b99e43f3c12586be5d9b178f.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a265fb98b99e43f3c12586be5d9b178f.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a265fb98b99e43f3c12586be5d9b178f.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a265fb98b99e43f3c12586be5d9b178f.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a265fb98b99e43f3c12586be5d9b178f.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a265fb98b99e43f3c12586be5d9b178f.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a265fb98b99e43f3c12586be5d9b178f.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a265fb98b99e43f3c12586be5d9b178f.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the case of Starbucks, we could argue that the stock always traded for high valuation multiples and therefore current valuation multiples seem in line with previous numbers. Hence, we can argue that Starbucks might be fairly valued and neither under- nor overvalued. However, valuation multiples can’t be justified by looking only at previous data or comparing a company to its industry peers. High valuation multiples can only be justified by high expected growth rates in the years to come.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Quarterly Results</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To answer the question of whether Starbucks deserves the high valuation multiples we can start by looking at the last quarter's results. While Starbucks<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510664-starbucks-non-gaap-eps-of-0_52-misses-by-0_03-revenue-of-9_6b-beats-by-250m\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510664-starbucks-non-gaap-eps-of-0_52-misses-by-0_03-revenue-of-9_6b-beats-by-250m\" target=\"_blank\"> did beat revenue estimates</a> by about $250 million, it did miss earnings per share expectations. Aside from beating expectations, total net revenue increased from $9,074 million in Q4/24 to $9,569 million in Q4/25 – resulting in 5.5% year-over-year growth for the top line.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1387\" data-height=\"561\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Starbucks is reporting fourth quarter results\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"259\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-1761840643372864_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Starbucks Q4/25 FactSheet</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While revenue increased in the mid-single digits, operating income declined steeply (78.7% year-over-year) from $1,306.9 million in the same quarter last year to $278.2 million in this quarter.

Of course, we find some positive news in the last earnings report like global comparable store sales increased 1%, making this the first positive quarter in seven quarters. In the United States, comparable store sales were flat year-over-year with average ticket up 1% (reflecting fewer discount-driven offers in the current year).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among the three segments, it was especially Channel Development that grew with a high pace (16.6% year-over-year growth), but the segment is only responsible for about 5.5% of total revenue and the company was unable to transfer high revenue growth for the segment into bottom-line growth as operating income increased only 0.2% year-over-year to $265.2 million.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Situation in China Improving</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the most important markets for Starbucks is still Mainland China as it offers huge growth potential for the business (in comparison to the United States, a market that is probably saturated already). And in the last few years because of China’s economy struggling, Starbucks also struggled. However, the situation in China is improving and net revenue increased 6.1% year-over-year from $783.7 million in Q4/24 to $831.6 million in Q4/25.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2034\" data-height=\"704\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Starbucks: Situation in China is improving a little bit\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"222\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/47657197-17618406457335103_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Starbucks Q4/25 Earnings Release</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The store count continues to increase in China with Starbucks opening 415 stores during the last twelve months (net store openings) and having 8,011 stores in China at the end of Q4/25.

What makes me rather optimistic is the CSI 300 index, which might have found its bottom and is marching higher in the last few months. And the stock market usually being a leading indicator, this might be a slightly bullish sign.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>United States: Huge Question Marks</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China is certainly an important market and might contribute to growth for Starbucks, but we should also not ignore that China still generates only about 8.5% of total sales for Starbucks and the most important market is without doubt the United States (responsible for two-thirds of total revenue).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my last article I already talked about the risk of the United States entering a recession. And despite the stock market making new all-time highs and sentiment being extremely bullish, I see the picture slowly worsening. Of course, the following selection of indicators is certainly not perfect and is biased in some way, but aside from the treasury yield (visualized by the<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y3M\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y3M\" target=\"_blank\"> T10Y3M</a> and<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y\" target=\"_blank\"> T10Y2Y</a>), which inverted and “re-inverted” again and is a strong sign for a recession, there are other early warning indicators.

However, the economy is hardly adding jobs anymore and this is not a good sign. However, other leading indicators like the<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SAHMREALTIME\" target=\"_blank\"> Sahm Rule</a> are not indicating a recession so far.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And this is making me very cautious about Starbucks. On the other hand, the company can grow its delivery business in the United States by 30% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and is surpassing $1 billion in sales for the full year. Additionally, Starbucks is optimistic its “Back to Starbucks” strategy is working and CEO Brian Niccol stated<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835018-starbucks-corporation-sbux-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835018-starbucks-corporation-sbux-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\"> during the last earnings call</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>A year ago, we launched our Back to Starbucks strategy to get us back to the exceptional craft, connection and welcoming coffee houses that define the Starbucks Experience and set us apart. Since then, we've been focused on executing our plan and accelerating it where we've seen opportunity. We took the significant step of scaling several key pieces of work during the quarter, and it's clear from our results that our plan is working, and our turnaround is taking hold.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Part of this strategy is assessing stores and closing unprofitable stores. During the last earnings call, CFO Catherine Smith stated:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>This included the completion of our assessment of our coffee house portfolio and identified closures as well as a simplification of our broader support organization to one that is streamlined and more closely aligned to our future growth priorities. Let me walk through some of the impacts to our financials. In the fourth quarter, we had 107 net store closures globally as part of the restructuring we announced in September. These coffee houses were deemed unable to meet our standards for customer experience even through a potential uplift or for profitability.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aside from closing stores, Starbucks is also uplifting some of its stores and has a new coffee house prototype and has completed nearly 70 uplifts so far and is planning about 1,000 uplifted stores until the end of fiscal 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Weakening Moat</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another question is whether Starbucks still has a wide economic moat and therefore a strategic advantage that will lead to above-average growth in the years to come. Starbucks’ economic moat is built heavily around its brand name, which enables the company to charge premium prices to its customers. However, in the list of top 100 global brands (by<a href=\"https://interbrand.com/best-global-brands/global/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://interbrand.com/best-global-brands/global/\" target=\"_blank\"> Interbrand</a>), Starbucks is obviously not among the top 100 anymore. In previous years, Starbucks was usually listed somewhere around spot 50 and falling out of that list would indicate a steep decline in brand value.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a4e401b7f4d19f16cf8d14f4306fb023.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a4e401b7f4d19f16cf8d14f4306fb023.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a4e401b7f4d19f16cf8d14f4306fb023.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a4e401b7f4d19f16cf8d14f4306fb023.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a4e401b7f4d19f16cf8d14f4306fb023.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a4e401b7f4d19f16cf8d14f4306fb023.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a4e401b7f4d19f16cf8d14f4306fb023.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a4e401b7f4d19f16cf8d14f4306fb023.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a4e401b7f4d19f16cf8d14f4306fb023.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another red flag is the declining return on invested capital in the last five years.

However, we must be a little cautious and not only look at simple valuation multiples as they are sometimes misleading. Valuation multiples are using the results of the last four quarters, which can be an outlier leading to much higher or much lower valuation multiples.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Instead, we use a discounted cash flow calculation to determine an intrinsic value for Starbucks. As always, I calculate with a discount rate of 10% (the annual return I like to achieve at least from an investment) and 1.141 billion diluted shares outstanding. Now it is getting more difficult as we have to make assumptions for the years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In an optimistic scenario we can assume that Starbucks will be able to grow with a high pace in line with analysts estimates, which see Starbucks growing at least in the low to mid-teens in the years to come. As basis we can take the free cash flow of the last four quarters, which was $2.442 billion and when assuming Starbucks will grow between 12% and 13% in the next ten years followed by 6% growth until perpetuity, the stock is fairly valued right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is difficult to assess how realistic these assumptions are. Over the last ten years, earnings per share actually declined, but when taking a different year, the picture is completely different and earnings per share are growing in the high single digits or even double digits due to the heavy fluctuations (see section above). Revenue grew with a CAGR of 6.42% in the last five years and a CAGR of 8.20% in the last ten years. Combining these revenue growth rates with improving margins, double-digit growth rates seem possible again. However, when assuming that Starbucks might only be able to grow in the mid-to-high single digits, we get an intrinsic value of $50 to $60, and the stock is still overvalued.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problem for Starbucks can be summed up quite simply. Even when estimating that Starbucks’ situation can improve again and the company might grow with a higher pace, the stock is still trading for extremely high valuation multiples and high growth expectations are already reflected in the stock price. There is little upside for investors here: If Starbucks can actually improve its business again, it is good for investors and is making the stock fairly valued. If the situation for Starbucks is not improving, the stock is overvalued and might decline in the coming months and quarters. Maybe investors won’t lose any money, but there is not much upside potential at this point.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The combination of declining margins, low revenue growth rates, the risk of the United States (and many other countries around the world) entering a recession and the high valuation multiples for Starbucks makes me extremely cautious right now and the stock is still a “Hold” at best.</p>",

The company reported record Q3 revenue of $33.1 billion, which was up by a solid 40.8% year-over-year and 10.1% sequentially.</p> <p>Over the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> last few months, the stock has surged as it’s up 50% since early June. At the time, we covered the stock in an article covering AI growth and geopolitical risk, providing a scenario that could take the stock toward the $300s:</span></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>If we see the next drop take the form of a 3-wave drop that holds over $146, then we could be setting up for a rally toward the $300s.” </em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At time of writing, the stock was at $203 and touched $304 on Oct. 15.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For Taiwan Semiconductor, the outlook is two-fold. On one hand, TSMC is deepening its moat with advanced nodes, such as N2 and A16. The company already powers tens of trillions in market cap on the stock market when you consider Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>), Broadcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>), Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), AMD (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>), and Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) are customers of TSMC. Essentially, all mega-cap stocks have an AI strategy spanning merchant GPUs and custom silicon, and of course, software—yet the common denominator to these strategies is they all funnel into TSMC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, on the other hand, many pundits have been asking, are we in an AI bubble? While AI leaders, related suppliers, and strong R&amp;D teams march onward with exceptional earnings reports, ongoing deal announcements and provide strong commentary that AI demand greatly outstrips supply, investors are left wondering what the true value is for the outsized growth. They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and TSMC’s valuation chart certainly fits that description:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1616\" data-height=\"1066\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TSMC’s forward price-to-sales ratio surges to 12.2x, its highest level since the start of the AI boom\" width=\"1280\" height=\"844\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPm_07pReVYa3lrQ_st.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Source: YCharts <span>(Tech Insider Network)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although no risk management strategy will be entirely error-free, we have a plan to handle the tech sector’s inevitable volatility, something we <span class=\"highlighted_text\">provide to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout/mp_1326\">stock newsletter subscribers</a>.

This is up from the 30% growth provided in Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management sounded very optimistic during the Q3 earnings call about long-term AI growth opportunities. As discussed below, AI momentum is stronger than expected. The growing adoption of AI consumer models is driving strong demand for AI chips. Similarly, enterprise AI demand is strong, and the rising sovereign AI opportunity will become another strong growth driver.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TSMC: AI Accelerator Growth to Hit Mid-40% CAGR by 2029</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management commentary suggested the chipmaker’s AI outlook through 2029 may be revised higher than the previously guided mid-40% CAGR, though TSMC declined to provide an updated figure, opting to hold off until early 2026:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p><em>AI demand actually continues to be very strong, (it's) stronger than we thought three months ago, OK? So in today's situation, we have talked to customers and then we talk to customers' customer.</em></p> <p><em>So the CAGR we previously we announced is about mid-40s. It's (still) a little bit better than that. We will update you probably in beginning of next year so we have a more clear picture. Today, the (numbers) are insane.”</em></p> </blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TSMC Reports Softer HPC Growth After Historic Q2 Gains</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TSMC reported a softer QoQ increase in HPC revenue in Q3 after the chipmaker posted its largest sequential growth in Q2 at nearly $3 billion. Q3 saw sequential growth of just over ~$800 million in USD terms, or ~5% QoQ, versus over 20% QoQ growth seen in Q2. However, Q3’s USD-visible growth continued to be inflated by forex, as HPC revenue in NTD was approximately flat QoQ at ~NT$564 billion, versus over 13% growth in Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, looking closer, HPC also saw its percentage of total revenue decline three points from Q2 to Q3, from 60% of total revenue to 57%. Meanwhile, smartphone revenue came in quite strong, gaining three points in total revenue to 30% share as revenue surged nearly 23% QoQ to $9.9 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The softness in HPC revenue may stem from the upcoming platform shift to Nvidia’s Rubin architecture, which relies on a customized 3nm node, N3P, whereas Blackwell relies on TSMC’s N4P process, a customized 5nm node. As you can see in the chart below, TSMC reported a decline in HPC QoQ and YoY revenue at the time that Nvidia’s previous generation Hopper began to ship around Q1 2023. The decline persisted for a few quarters before TSMC resumed very strong QoQ growth in early 2024.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1626\" data-height=\"700\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TSMC’s high-performance computing revenue rose 57% year-over-year and 5% quarter-over-quarter in Q3 2025, easing from record Q2 gains as demand slows ahead of Nvidia’s Rubin launch\" width=\"1280\" height=\"551\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnCt7pReVYa3lrv_hpcrev.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">HPC revenue grew 57% YoY and 5% QoQ in Q3 2025, easing from record sequential gains in Q2 as demand pauses ahead of Nvidia’s Rubin ramp. <span>(Tech Insider Network)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia’s upcoming Rubin generation is slated to be released in the second half of 2026, as six variations entered trial production in August.

As Tom’s Hardware estimates, it could take 9-12 months or longer for Rubin to enter production.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, TSMC will likely report a lull in the HPC segment between the Blackwell and Rubin generations, as Nvidia represents the lion’s share of this segment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TSMC’s Q3 EPS Surges 50.5% Year-over-Year, Beating Estimates by Over 12%</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As much as TSMC is a top-line story, it's equally a bottom-line story. The company’s EPS grew by 50.5% YoY to $2.92, beating estimates by an impressive 12.3% with the strongest beat in the last two years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Analysts expect Q4 EPS to grow 26.8% YoY to $2.84 in Q4 and grow 25.5% in Q1. Looking forward, they expect EPS to grow 19.8% YoY to 12.34 in 2026 and 24.6% YoY to $15.48 in 2027.

For example, we see some stocks, such as Palantir (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR\" title=\"Palantir Technologies Inc.\">PLTR</a>), trading as high as 100 forward P/S, there are long-standing stocks like Broadcom trading higher than they ever have in their history, and it seems there are new deals being announced every day followed by 20%-plus pops.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding TSM, it’s up 290% since early 2023, while the Nasdaq is up 127% and market favorites like Apple are up 98%. There's no denying that TSMC has been a strong performer, as it’s the common denominator across the AI accelerator supply chain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below we look at the following to determine how to approach the combination of a strong AI stock with a high valuation:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The top reason that TSMC has seen strong price action and what must happen for the strong price action to continue.</li> <li>How to weigh the United States providing more funding to Intel (to date) compared to TSMC.</li> <li>A new trade setup for TSM now that our original trade plan has played out as described last June.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TSMC Strengthens Pricing Power as GPUs Transition to Advanced 3nm and 2nm Nodes</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TSMC’s impressive price performance reflects many factors, but at its core, it comes down to the company’s unmatched pricing power in the AI ecosystem. As we had discussed earlier, the chipmaker is the common denominator to essentially all mega-cap stocks’ AI strategies, and the company is deepening its moat with more advanced nodes, such as N2 and A16.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As chips progress to these more advanced nodes, such as Nvidia’s Rubin moving to 3nm and AMD now building CPUs on 2nm, TSMC stands to benefit from increased pricing power. This is because wafers at these new and upcoming nodes carry significant premiums versus the prior node, accounting for substantial increases in performance or power efficiency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pricing for TSMC’s 3nm node was originally <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-wafer-pricing-now-usd18-000-for-a-3nm-wafer-increased-by-over-3x-in-10-years-analyst\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/tsmcs-wafer-pricing-now-usd18-000-for-a-3nm-wafer-increased-by-over-3x-in-10-years-analyst\" target=\"_blank\">pegged</a> by analysts at ~$18,000 per wafer at the start of 2025, before rising just over 10% <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/09/05/news-tsmc-to-implement-a-significant-price-hike/\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/09/05/news-tsmc-to-implement-a-significant-price-hike/\" target=\"_blank\">to $20,000</a> by September, per reports. This would give the 2nm node a ~50% premium with its reported pricing at $30,000 per wafer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, reports claim that supply chain sources suggest 3nm pricing is <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/10/08/news-tsmc-2nm-reportedly-up-10-20-far-below-rumored-50-3-7nm-to-rise-single-digit-in-2026/\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/10/08/news-tsmc-2nm-reportedly-up-10-20-far-below-rumored-50-3-7nm-to-rise-single-digit-in-2026/\" target=\"_blank\">closer to $25,000</a> to $27,000 per wafer, a 50% uplift from the start of the year. This is important for TSMC, as this process underpins Nvidia’s Rubin, which is expected to see <a href=\"https://www.tweaktown.com/news/106116/nvidia-expected-to-ship-5-2m-blackwell-gpus-in-2025-1-8m-2026-and-7m-rubin/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.tweaktown.com/news/106116/nvidia-expected-to-ship-5-2m-blackwell-gpus-in-2025-1-8m-2026-and-7m-rubin/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">shipments of ~5.7 million</a> units next year, per JPMorgan. Assuming this pricing stands, this could provide a meaningful tailwind to TSMC’s AI revenue as Rubin ramps, though it would shrink the premium gap with 2nm to just 12-20%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TSMC Strong Margins Support Strong Pricing Power</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Margins continue to expand due to cost controls, higher capacity utilization rates, economies of scale, and better price negotiation with customers and suppliers.</li> <li>Operating margin crosses 50% in Q3.</li> <li>Net income grew by 50.3% YoY.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TSMC’s ability to generate exceptionally strong profits showcases that the company is one of the best-managed companies in the world. Despite the rising inflation, tariff concerns, technological advancement, trade wars, overseas fab expansion, and geopolitical tensions, TSMC has overcome these challenges by continuing to generate superior profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s gross margins improved 170 basis points YoY and 90 basis points sequentially to 59.5%. Cost improvements, better capacity utilization, and better price negotiation with customers and suppliers primarily drove the strong margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, it was partially offset by dilution from overseas fabs and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Management expects gross margin to improve 50 basis points further sequentially and 100 basis points YoY in Q4 to 60% with a boost from favorable foreign exchange rates next quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating profits grew by 50% YoY to $16.74 billion, with an operating margin of 50.6%, an improvement of 310 basis points YoY and 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by higher gross profits and operating leverage. TSMC beat its operating margin guidance by a solid 410 basis points. Management's Q4 guide is 50%.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1624\" data-height=\"1128\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TSMC’s Q3 2024 operating margin increased by 310 basis points year-over-year to 50.6%, driven by strong cost control, operating leverage, and sustained AI demand\" width=\"1280\" height=\"889\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPnD_7pReVYa3lr4_TSMCQ3OperatingMarginRisesto50.6_25onAIDemandandCostControl.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">TSMC’s operating margin climbed to 50.6% in Q3 2024, up 310 basis points year-over-year, reflecting strong cost control, operating leverage, and continued AI-driven demand. <span>(Tech Insider Network)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite higher capex, cash was also strong, with operating cash flow at 43.9% compared to 51.6% in the same period last year.

The free cash flows were down due to higher capex, which grew by 51.6% YoY to $9.7 billion to support strong further growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks: China, Margins Following Onshoring, and Intel</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we look into the future, there are puts and takes to onshoring. Last Friday, TSM and Nvidia <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/10/16/news-tsmc-plans-faster-shift-to-n2-and-more-advanced-nodes-in-arizona-amid-soaring-ai-demand/\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/10/16/news-tsmc-plans-faster-shift-to-n2-and-more-advanced-nodes-in-arizona-amid-soaring-ai-demand/\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> that the first US-made Blackwell wafer was produced at TSM’s Phoenix fab, marking an important milestone in building domestic supply chains for advanced chip production. However, this will mark a new test for TSMC’s pricing power, as AMD CEO Lisa Su has stated that US-made chips will be between <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/first-us-made-nvidia-blackwell-wafer-manufactured-at-tsmcs-arizona-fab/\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/first-us-made-nvidia-blackwell-wafer-manufactured-at-tsmcs-arizona-fab/\" target=\"_blank\">5% and 20%</a> more expensive than Taiwan-made chips, with rumors that US chips could be as much as <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/us-made-processor-prices-could-soar-if-the-rumour-that-tsmc-might-charge-as-much-as-30-percent-more-for-its-arizona-chips-pans-out/\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/us-made-processor-prices-could-soar-if-the-rumour-that-tsmc-might-charge-as-much-as-30-percent-more-for-its-arizona-chips-pans-out/\" target=\"_blank\">30%</a> more expensive. While bringing this level of capacity to Arizona could provide a strong tailwind for revenue over the next handful of years, TSMC will have to prove it can maintain strong margins should US-made chips continue to command a premium versus Taiwanese chips.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although Intel has largely been written off, given it has nowhere near the IP as TSMC on advanced nodes, it’s important to note that Intel is seeing outsized support from the United States <a href=\"https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1748/intel-and-trump-administration-reach-historic-agreement-to?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=substack\" rel=\"noopener noopener\" title=\"https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1748/intel-and-trump-administration-reach-historic-agreement-to?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=substack\" target=\"_blank\">with</a> $11.1 billion in funding compared to TSMC’s $11.6 <a href=\"https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1748/intel-and-trump-administration-reach-historic-agreement-to?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=substack\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1748/intel-and-trump-administration-reach-historic-agreement-to?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=substack\" target=\"_blank\">billion</a> despite the company being the market leader in the manufacturing of most advanced chips (so far).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Broadly understood yet important to note, geopolitical tensions related to China could negatively affect the stock. The company has been reducing this risk by setting up fabs outside of Taiwan. However, it will dilute margins, since the cost of setting up fabs and operating fabs in the US is higher than in Taiwan.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TSMC’s Technicals Overview:</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In our last report in June, we stated that:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>If we see the next drop take the form of a 3-wave drop that holds over $146, then we could be setting up for a rally toward the $300s.”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is exactly what happened, as we only saw a dip that tested $224 in what was obviously a 3-wave move. TSM then pressed toward $309, and starting to turn lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering that we saw TSM pushing toward our target zone on decelerating volume and momentum, it was apparent that we were in some type of 5th wave move, which is the final swing in a trend. There are two scenarios that make the most sense based solely on the price action.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2022\" data-height=\"844\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://images.prismic.io/bethtechnology/aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?auto=format,compress\" width=\"1280\" height=\"534\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_aPobTbpReVYa3mhc_tsmdailychart.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Tech Insider Network</span></p></figcaption></figure><ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Blue—We hit the lower bounds of a topping zone between $309-$340. If TSM can hold $264, we can see another swing into the upper regions of this topping zone in the coming weeks or months.

The S&amp;P 500® Index and the Nasdaq Composite hit multiple record highs. Even the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> beleaguered small-cap asset class participated in the beta-induced rally. The Russell 2000® Index had its best quarter since 4Q23 and hit fresh all-time highs in September.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI remained the dominant market theme, with several high-profile deals announced between the key players. The spending spree has been unprecedented on so many levels, and segments of the economy linked to this pervasive theme have continued to benefit. However, some pushback began to emerge as the quarter progressed, which centered on the question of monetization. The intricate relationships between key players were also under the microscope, with particular focus on the “circularity” around funding in the AI ecosystem. This conjured up memories of “vendor financing” during the dot-com era.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The decision by the Federal Reserve (the “Fed”) to cut rates also helped fuel some of the risk-on sentiment. Some questioned the Fed’s decision to cut rates absent any meaningful weakness in the labor market and the overall economy. Nevertheless, the Fed delivered the cut that the market was cheering for. By quarter end, it was unclear whether the Fed will cut once or twice during the remainder of the year. Another tailwind for risk markets was the better-than-expected corporate earnings season with expectations that 3Q earnings could also surprise to the upside. While some companies alluded to tariff headwinds, most were able to offset some of the impact through mitigation measures. Consumer spending also remained resilient, as evidenced by positive retail sales growth and strong summer travel demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Heading into the final quarter of the year, there does not appear to be a major market theme potent enough to dramatically alter the current narrative. The AI spending frenzy is likely to continue unabated. With FOMO a pervasive force in the market, we believe risk-on sentiment is likely to prevail. Fundamental investors will have to live to fight another day in this momentum-driven and beta-induced market.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance By Size And Style</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Small-cap equities outpaced both large- and mid-cap equities during the third quarter of 2025. Small-cap equities, as measured by the Russell 2000® Index, returned 12.39% during the quarter. Large-cap equities, as measured by the S&amp;P 500® Index and the Russell 1000® Index, returned 8.12% and 7.99%, respectively, while mid-cap stocks, as measured by the Russell Midcap® Index, returned 5.33%. Broken down by style, growth outpaced value within the large-cap size segment, while value outpaced growth within the small- and mid-cap segments. Specifically, for small-caps, the Russell 2000® Value Index returned 12.60%, outpacing its growth counterpart, which returned 12.19%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"757\" data-height=\"283\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Returns and performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"239\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618444322491384_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance Attribution Relative to the Russell 2000® Value Index – 3Q 2025</h2> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Positive Contributors</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Negative Contributors</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Stock Selection &amp; Overweight in Information Technology</p></td> <td><p>Stock Selection in Materials; <em>partially offset by overweight</em></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Underweight in Real Estate</p></td> <td><p>Stock Selection &amp; Underweight in Health Care</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Stock Selection in Industrials</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Stock Selection in Consumer Discretionary</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Stock Selection in Financials</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Stock Selection in Consumer Staples</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Underweight &amp; Stock Selection in Communication Services</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Source: FactSet.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio Attribution – Third Quarter</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Victory Sycamore Small Company Opportunity Fund (A Shares without sales charge) underperformed the Russell 2000® Value Index (the “Index”) in the third quarter of 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the quarter, stock selection and sector allocation both detracted from relative return, with stock selection having a larger impact on relative underperformance for the period. Index returns were positive across each of the 11 major economic sectors and varied widely, with only six sectors outpacing the broader Russell 2000® Value Index. Communication Services was the top-performing sector, returning 32.42%. By contrast, Consumer Staples was the worst-performing sector for the quarter, posting a return of 4.77%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, for the portfolio, stock selection in Materials, Health Care, Financials, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, Consumer Staples and Communication Services detracted from relative performance for the quarter. However, an overweight in Materials partially offset the unfavorable impact of selection in the sector. An underweight in Health Care and Communication Services (the top-performing sector) also detracted from relative return. Conversely, stock selection in Information Technology contributed to relative performance for the quarter. An underweight in Real Estate, as well as an overweight in Information Technology, also contributed to relative performance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top Contributors – Third Quarter</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Three of the top contributors in the quarter benefited from their association with the broader AI theme. Sandisk Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SNDK\" title=\"Sandisk Corporation\">SNDK</a>) recently spun out from Western Digital Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WDC\" title=\"Western Digital Corporation\">WDC</a>). SNDK became the only U.S.-listed pureplay NAND maker. The other key competitor is Kioxia in Japan. SNDK got caught up in the AI hype, and its share price reacted positively. It is important to highlight that share price appreciation was a function of a read-through from favorable industry data. Industry reports began to emerge highlighting supply shortages in the coming years, driven by strong demand for AI servers. Supply has tightened over the past few years, setting NAND up for strong demand and pricing amid constrained supply. We trimmed the position given the outsized move. Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSEM\" title=\"Tower Semiconductor Ltd.\">TSEM</a>) also got caught up in the AI hype. TSEM produces Silicon Photonics chips that are used in optical transceivers, which connect data center servers via optics rather than copper Ethernet. TSEM works with all the top non-China optical transceiver module manufacturers. Many of its peers had exited the Silicon Photonics channel, leaving TSEM as a key supplier. Strong demand for optical networking, coupled with limited suppliers, has benefited TSEM. We trimmed the position following the strong performance. NCR Atleos Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NATL\" title=\"NCR Atleos Corporation\">NATL</a>), which produces self-service banking (ATMs) and Networks (ATM network) assets, was another top contributor. Since its spin-off, the company has reinvented itself to partner with key financial institutions and retail clients. The company’s core growth engine, ATM as a Service (ATMaaS), posted a robust growth rate of 32% YoY and management is anticipating achieving 40% in 2H25. The ATMaaS offering is a full suite of products including hardware, software, cash management and transaction processing supported by the largest ATM fleet globally. Management has also prioritized deleveraging, as evidenced by reduced net leverage to 3.1x from 3.8x, with a target of 2.5x. Our thesis for NATL remains unchanged. Mercury Systems, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRCY\" title=\"Mercury Systems, Inc.\">MRCY</a>) is a leading technology provider that provides mission-critical components, modules and subsystems mainly to defense prime contractors. MRCY reported better-than-expected results in 2Q25 due to operational improvements and good execution. Demand remains strong, with current bookings at $1.4 billion—the highest level ever. MRCY could be a beneficiary of the Golden Dome build-out given the company’s leverage to antiballistic systems; however, timing remains unclear. We have reduced our weight following strong relative performance. Our thesis for MRCY remains unchanged at this time. Everus Construction Group, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ECG\" title=\"Everus Construction Group, Inc.\">ECG</a>), a commercial and utilities construction company, rounded out the list of top contributors. The company reported a solid 2Q25 earnings report driven by strong data center construction demand. Year- over-year backlog grew 24% on the back of strong data center demand. We believe ECG should continue to benefit from the build-out of data centers as well as other large construction projects. Shares were trimmed on relative valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top Detractors – Third Quarter</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Haemonetics Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HAE\" title=\"Haemonetics Corporation\">HAE</a>), a medical technology company specializing in plasma, blood, and hospital-based automation systems, was the top detractor for the quarter. Shares declined as operational issues in the Interventional Technologies business (about 20% of sales) surfaced, driving weakness in the Hospital segment and reducing visibility into sales and earnings improvements. Confidence in management’s diversification strategy was under scrutiny after $1 billion of acquisitions over the last few years have failed to pay off. The thesis for HAE is under review. Interparfums, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IPAR\" title=\"Interparfums, Inc.\">IPAR</a>), a global manufacturer and marketer of fragrance products, was negatively impacted by uneven demand in Europe and retailer destocking in the U.S., which resulted in a top-line miss during the second quarter. Furthermore, IPAR is facing tariffs on the finished products and components it ships into the U.S. The company is addressing this challenge through supply chain modifications and selective pricing action. Despite these factors, IPAR reiterated its FY25 guidance. While management is historically viewed as providing conservative expectations for investors, the company noted lower visibility in this challenging environment. IPAR remains a disciplined operator with new launches and brand license additions that position it to benefit once macro and trade headwinds ease. As we do with all holdings, the thesis for IPAR is under review. Silgan Holdings, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLGN\" title=\"Silgan Holdings Inc.\">SLGN</a>), a manufacturer of packaging solutions for consumer goods products, was another detractor. SLGN reported 2Q25 earnings that missed consensus estimates. The earnings shortfall was driven by: 1) unfavorable weather which impacted the Beverage segment; and 2) customer bankruptcy (Del Monte Foods). We believe that the reaction to the 2Q print was overdone and we view the 2Q earnings hiccup as transitory. Our thesis for SLGN remains unchanged at this time. Shares of WillScot Holdings Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WSC\" title=\"WillScot Holdings Corporation\">WSC</a>), a leading provider of modular space and portable storage rentals, were under pressure during the quarter. WSC is a recent addition to the portfolio. We initiated a position in the company following a period of significant underperformance as deterioration in non-residential construction markets negatively impacted rental volumes. While the company has continued to see disappointing results this year, it could see green shoots in a lower interest rate environment, which we believe should set the stock up well given negative sentiment and historical trough valuation. Bowhead Specialty Holdings, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BOW\" title=\"Bowhead Specialty Holdings Inc.\">BOW</a>), a specialty Property and Casualty (P&amp;C) insurer, rounded out the list of top detractors. The company reported a strong 2Q25 with positive forward comments; however, decelerating pricing trends for the industry weighed on the peer group. Despite near-term underperformance, BOW remains well- capitalized, with disciplined execution and differentiated premium growth. We trimmed the position on strong relative outperformance earlier and view the recent pullback as an opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"739\" data-height=\"459\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Small caps have outperformed large caps\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"398\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618445293419316_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Market Overview</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Headwinds Mount With No End in Sight</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The third quarter was a continuation of the risk-on sentiment that has gripped the market since the April lows. The AI trade continued unabated. MEME stocks are back in vogue. Retail participation is at all-time highs. Trade baskets are ubiquitous—allowing market participants to trade any theme they fancy. Market concentration remains elevated, with a handful of themes (and associated stocks) driving the narrative. FOMO is pervasive, and missing out is not an option. Simply put, the market is more emotionally charged and less fundamentally driven. That’s the landscape that investors have had to navigate, and the results for active managers have not been favorable. The pervasiveness of the themes (e.g., AI, crypto, quantum computing, gold, etc.) dominating the market have created stiff headwinds for fundamental managers that have been difficult to overcome. The current market backdrop has become a story of the “haves” and “have nots.” Either a company is exposed to the prevailing market themes, or it is not. Price action has generally reflected this dynamic by rewarding companies that are exposed and neglecting ones that are not.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We’ve had numerous conversations with clients over the past several quarters, and many are equally puzzled by the current market backdrop. Top of mind for clients was a combination of topics, including underperformance, the market dynamics causing these stylistic headwinds, and the topic of AI. We will touch on some of these items below.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stylistic Headwinds Reflective of the Risk-On Sentiment</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There was an abundance of investor confidence heading into 2025. The S&amp;P 500® Index had posted back-to-back years of 20%+ returns, and the outlook for risk assets was promising. Then uncertainty plagued the market shortly after the presidential inauguration as a frenzy of policies out of Washington spooked investors. The subsequent sell-off lasted several weeks but eventually bottomed in early April.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since then, animal spirits have unleashed an impressive wave of risk-on sentiment that propelled equities higher. The S&amp;P 500® Index and the Nasdaq Composite hit multiple record highs during the third quarter. Even the beleaguered small-cap asset class has participated in the beta-induced rally. The Russell 2000® Index had its best quarter since 4Q23 and hit fresh all-time highs in September. It took the Russell 2000® Index over 970 days to surpass the prior all-time highs it reached in November 2021 (Illustration 1).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, the recent small-cap rally has been so pronounced that the Russell 2000® Index has outperformed the S&amp;P 500® Index since the April lows (Illustration 2), 39.3% versus 35.1%, respectively. As a dedicated small- and mid-cap value manager, small-caps’ outperformance is welcomed given that we have had to persevere through a long performance drought versus large-cap equities. However, the recent small-cap rally has been a double- edged sword.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The recent equity melt-up has been concentrated and low quality in nature, which has posed stiff headwinds for active managers. As Illustrations 3 and 4 highlight, the rally off the April lows has been dominated by risk factors. For example, the performance of stocks in the highest Beta quintile (Q1) for the Russell 2000® Value Index meaningfully outperformed (+77.4%) the quintile with the lowest Beta (Q5) stocks (+21.9%). The same conclusion can be observed for other factors such as Volatility, Short Interest and Profitability. Not only was this observed in the small-cap value universe, but also in the mid-cap value universe, as Illustration 4 shows. As a quality- biased fundamental manager, underexposure to some of these Risk factors has resulted in a notable performance drag.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also exacerbating the recent performance challenges has been the high concentration within the indices. Not only has this been observed in the S&amp;P 500® Index (Illustration 5), but this phenomenon has recently unfolded in the small-cap value and mid-cap value indices as well. As observed in Illustrations 6 and 7, the contribution of the top 50 stocks within these indices is high relative to history dating back to 1994. Not owning certain stocks that made up the top contributors within the indices has also been a performance headwind. The decision not to own some of these stocks varies. For some stocks—especially those linked to the AI trade—valuations are too lofty. For others, the balance sheet is less than ideal. Others, especially within the small-cap universe, do not meet our investment criteria. For example, 12 out of the top 25 contributors to the Russell 2000® Value Index during the third quarter were non-earners (Illustration 8).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In combination with the risk-on sentiment, Momentum continued to outperform as market participants’ preference for “what’s working” remains well cemented. Historically, Momentum regimes have generally faltered after an extended period. This one is getting long in the tooth, but there appears to be no end in sight given that investors continue to crowd into the major market themes. We did witness a Momentum unwind during the first quarter following the reveal of DeepSeek. However, that was short-lived. Illustrations 9 and 10 show year-to-date factor performance versus their long-term median since 2002 for the Russell Midcap® Value Index and Russell 2000® Value Index. Clearly, Risk and Momentum’s year-to-date performance has exceeded the long- term median. Quality and Value factors which have typically outperformed over the long term have lagged year-to-date. Furthermore, Illustration 11 highlights the divergence that has unfolded between momentum and fundamental stability within the broader S&amp;P 500® Index. This is reflective of a market that is less interested in fundamentals and valuation and more focused on broader themes. Being underweight to the Momentum and Beta factors has been penalizing. These observations highlight the challenges facing our bottom-up fundamental process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Illustration 3: Performance of Key Factors During Three Market Regimes in the Russell 2000® Value Index</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Regime 1: Leading to Inauguration Day (1/1 – 1/17)</p></td> <td><p>Regime 2: Post-Inauguration to April Lows (1/21 – 4/8)</p></td> <td><p>Regime 3: Rebound off April Lows (4/9 – 9/30)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Beta Q1 (Highest)</p></td> <td><p>2.5%</p></td> <td><p>-32.3%</p></td> <td><p>77.4%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Beta Q5 (Lowest)</p></td> <td><p>0.3%</p></td> <td><p>-9.7%</p></td> <td><p>21.9%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Earners (Profitable)</p></td> <td><p>2.2%</p></td> <td><p>-18.6%</p></td> <td><p>28.2%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Non-Earners (Loss-Making)</p></td> <td><p>0.0%</p></td> <td><p>-27.7%</p></td> <td><p>62.3%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Short Interest Q1 (Highest)</p></td> <td><p>1.4%</p></td> <td><p>-31.2%</p></td> <td><p>72.6%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Short Interest Q5 (Lowest)</p></td> <td><p>1.0%</p></td> <td><p>-14.0%</p></td> <td><p>17.9%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Volatility Q1 (Highest)</p></td> <td><p>1.7%</p></td> <td><p>-28.2%</p></td> <td><p>125.4%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Volatility Q5 (Lowest)</p></td> <td><p>1.1%</p></td> <td><p>-14.1%</p></td> <td><p>15.3%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Source: FactSet.

Today, we find ourselves in a predicament. Our bottom-up fundamental approach that is centered on the risk/reward merits of individual securities is out of favor. Market participants have been eager to reward companies linked to the key prevailing themes in the market irrespective of fundamentals or valuations. Some of our holdings in the portfolio have benefited from their association with these themes; however, their valuation has forced us to de-risk the positions. In other words, selling Momentum as a result of our valuation-centric approach has adversely impacted relative performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Take Fabrinet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FN\" title=\"Fabrinet\">FN</a>), for example. FN is a leading global electronic manufacturing services (EMS) company focused on the optical communications market. We first initiated a position in FN in September 2020. The original investment thesis was based on the company’s leading market position in the optical networking market. We believed FN was well-positioned to benefit from the increase in demand for bandwidth and infrastructure build-out for 5G networks. Throughout our holding period, FN consistently met or beat expectations. In 2023, the company secured a large project with NVDA for its data center operations. As Illustration 12 highlights, shares have re-rated meaningfully higher and have continued to appreciate even after our sale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Many of our clients have asked whether we can tweak the process to allow us to hold onto the winners longer. That is a valid question. However, if we chose to hold onto winners longer, how would we define our sell discipline? A key reason for the success we’ve had in delivering compelling risk-adjusted returns over the long run is centered on a well-defined sell discipline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Illustration 13 highlights the valuation framework for FN at the time of initiation and at the time of sale. At the time of initiation, FN was trading at a discount to its long-term average on multiple valuation metrics. Given that it is now widely acknowledged that FN is linked to the AI ecosystem, with Nvidia one of its largest clients, shares have re-rated meaningfully higher. Due to the elevated valuation, shares were divested.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In hindsight, an argument can be made that it was a poorly timed sale. Going back to the question of whether we can hold our winners (momentum stocks) longer—if we had held on to stocks like FN in the portfolio, could we even consider ourselves a value manager, given the elevated valuations?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AI theme has been such a potent force in the market that it’s buoying the valuations of exposed companies higher, making it difficult for disciplined value managers to own some of these stocks. Unfortunately, not owning companies with AI exposure has adversely impacted performance. Fundamental value managers are caught between a rock and a hard place. Managers must decide whether to deviate from their process or remain committed and risk sacrificing performance. That’s the predicament that fundamental value investors have to grapple with in a market overwhelmed by broad themes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"745\" data-height=\"236\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"2025 factor returns vs. median since 2002 in Russell Midcap Value Index\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"203\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618447674556062_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

However, when the market becomes one-dimensional and singularly focused, underlying risks can be underappreciated. The AI theme is so pervasive that it currently dominates every aspect of the market and the economy. Investors are plowing an unprecedented amount of capital into a potentially transformative technology that (as of now) has no proven path to profitability. But that does not seem to matter; the stampede to have a role in the AI ecosystem remains unabated. For the key players, missing out on the technology of the future is not an option. Therefore, a copious amount of capital is being pledged to help build out the infrastructure needed to satisfy the demand. And the web of capital chasing the AI narrative is becoming increasingly intertwined.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We cannot refute the potential benefits of AI and the role it will play in society in the future. However, a lot hinges on AI being able to deliver on its promises. Today, despite the euphoric response to this technology, many questions remain unanswered. For the most part, the market does not seem to be bothered by the unchecked spending bonanza. The lack of concern for the elusive return on investment is puzzling. A level of complacency has settled into the market where many investors are focused only on the upside while few are evaluating what could go wrong with the current narrative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s touch on a couple of interesting thoughts from some of AI’s Heads of State. On an episode of the “Access” podcast, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had the following to say:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>“If we end up misspending a couple of hundred billion dollars, I think that that is going to be very unfortunate, obviously But what I’d</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>say is I actually think the risk is higher on the other side.”</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At a recent press conference, OpenAI’s Sam Altman alluded to “profitability” not being a top concern for the company’s leadership team, saying the following:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>“[Profitability is]........ not in my top 10 concerns, but we obviously</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>someday have to be very profitable.”</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here’s some additional food for thought on sell-side analyst ratings based on FactSet data as of October 11, 2025:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>AMZN: 96% of sell-side analysts have a “Buy” rating with no “Sell” ratings (72 analysts covering)</li> <li>GOOG: 82% of sell-side analysts have a “Buy” rating with no “Sell” ratings (74 analysts covering)</li> <li>META: 87% of sell-side analysts have a “Buy” rating with one “Sell” rating (71 analysts covering)</li> <li>NVDA: 89% of sell-side analysts have a “Buy” rating with one “Sell rating” (66 analysts covering)</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It has been our experience that when management teams don’t practice capital discipline, they are penalized by the investment community. It is somewhat bewildering how that is being dismissed today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where is the healthy dose of skepticism that we would expect from Wall Street analysts? That’s the issue; there is essentially none. Groupthink has become an emblematic (and unfortunate) part of this market. Prudent investors should assess the downside risks especially when the consensus is so lopsided. While trying to call a market top is problematic, we will offer some observations below and leave it up to our readers to draw their own conclusions of whether or not we are in a bubble.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Comparing to the Dot-Com Era, There’s Room to Run</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AI frenzy is often likened to the Tech Bubble of the 1990s; therefore, that period is typically used as a barometer to determine whether the AI- fueled market rally has room to run. As can be observed in Illustration 14, the Nasdaq Composite is following a similar path to the one taken during the 1990s. However, when the MAG-7 stocks are evaluated on their own, they are diverging higher at a quicker pace. Interestingly, the Nasdaq’s rise during the 1990s was not a smooth one. In fact, there were eight corrections of 10% or more before the index eventually peaked in 2000 (Illustration 15). In other words, the origin of the dot-com era bubble was not a linear one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"744\" data-height=\"239\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Tech performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"206\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448757744114_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"767\" data-height=\"433\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Declines in Nasdaq composite\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"361\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618448904172337_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By contrast, during the current AI-fueled melt-up, there have been four such corrections since the launch of ChatGPT in 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even when comparing Nvidia to Cisco in the 1990s, Nvidia’s meteoric rise may not be over. As Illustration 16 highlights, Nvidia was trading at 27.7x price/sales at the end of the third quarter. Cisco peaked at 39.0x price/sales in 2000.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An argument can be made that there is still some upside potential for the latest rally given that valuations have not reached the frothiness of the 1990s. As former Citi CEO Chuck Prince famously said in 2007, “…as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.” There’s an unprecedented spending spree flowing into the AI ecosystem. As long as the spending bonanza continues, another leg up for equities is not out of the question.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI CapEx Is Unprecedented, but Is It Sustainable?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OpenAI, the most valuable start-up in the world, has pledged $1 trillion in spending to build out the infrastructure needed to support its models. The scale of investment in AI infrastructure is unprecedented and is reminiscent of the dot-com investment craze in the 1990s. A September 24, 2025 Eye on the Market note from J.P. Morgan highlighted the impact that the AI-exposed stocks have had on the S&amp;P 500® Index. Per the note, AI-exposed stocks have accounted for 75% of the index returns, 80% of earnings growth and 90% of capital spending since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. At the end of the third quarter, the MAG-7 CapEx explained approximately 30% of total CapEx for the S&amp;P 500® Index (Illustration 17).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The meaningful jump in year-over-year (YoY) CapEx spend from 2023 to 2025 has helped fuel the rally in AI-exposed stocks (Illustration 18). U.S. hyperscaler CapEx growth jumped by 79% from 2023 to 2024. By some estimates, CapEx growth will peak in 2025 and fall sharply in 2026 and beyond. While CapEx growth will not go to zero, 2026 estimates call for 17% growth while 2027 estimates fall to 7%. The question is whether the market is prepared to digest a decline in the CapEx growth rate given that it’s been the central tenet to the market rally.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Is the Market Prepared for a Another “Bad” Data Point?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recall what happened in January when a wrench was thrown into the AI narrative in the form of DeepSeek. As Illustration 19 highlights, stocks linked to the AI theme rapidly sold off after DeepSeek’s reveal. Trillions in market cap was erased from the U.S. equity market in a short time. While the sell- off was short-lived, it highlighted the fragility of the narrative given that few are thinking about what could go wrong. Therefore, when future hyperscaler CapEx growth figures begin to pale in comparison to the past two years, what sort of reaction will we get from the market?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuations for AI-exposed stocks are mostly pricing in positive news with little wiggle room for any disappointments. Illustration 20 shows how quickly the S&amp;P 500® Index de-rated following the release of DeepSeek. The question is what sort of response will we get from the market when/if future data points disappoint or AI fails to deliver on its Herculean promise?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"736\" data-height=\"236\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Rise of Cisco Systems\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"205\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618449404018123_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

Aside from Nvidia, the FCF growth profile of the other MAG-7 stocks has deteriorated (Illustration 21). After all, the defining feature of “big tech” companies has been their unmatched free cash flow generation. As the hyperscalers jockey for a seat at the table in the AI arms race, their business models are being transformed from “asset light” to capital-intensive ones.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a recent research note, Empirical Research Partners made an interesting observation relating to CapEx worth sharing. Based on their findings, since the 1950s, stocks in the highest quintile of YoY CapEx growth have underperformed the market thereafter (Illustration 22). So far, the hyperscalers have bucked that trend during this cycle. We suspect that this is partly due to the significant FCF profile of these megacap tech companies. Hence, the spending spree can continue longer than in prior CapEx cycles before there’s any possible impact on their share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regardless, history is littered with examples of how overzealous CapEx spending booms can end badly. Whether it was the railroads in the late- 1880s, the British Bicycle bubble in the 1890s, or the telecom and internet bubble in the 1990s, too much funding chasing a new innovation can result in a glut and misallocation of capital. AI profitability remains elusive, but that has not deterred massive investment. It remains to be seen whether this CapEx cycle will prove to be different from prior ones when too much capacity was brought online too fast and demand failed to keep up with the frantic pace of spending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618450723474953.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MAG-7 YoverY FCF growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"372\" height=\"232\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618450723474953.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618450723474953.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618450723474953.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618450723474953.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618450723474953.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618450723474953.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618450723474953.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618450723474953.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

It seems that not a day goes by without some headlines describing how suppliers are funding customers, revenue is shared between customer and vendor, and off-balance-sheet partnerships are being forged. In a recent client note, Morgan Stanley provided a descriptive (but hard to follow) diagram of the convoluted nature of this dynamic (Illustration 23).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These close-knit arrangements put investors in a dilemma. It becomes increasingly more difficult to evaluate the underlying opportunities and risks as these arrangements become more complex, as they are concentrated among a few players and lack transparency. This could (if it has not already) result in information asymmetry, which puts investors at a disadvantage. Essentially, it forces investors to take management at their word. As bottom-up fundamental investors, we spend a considerable amount of time evaluating management teams. Over the years, it’s become evident that not all management teams have a favorable track record of being good stewards of capital. Without adequate disclosures, a system of checks and balances becomes elusive and identifying risks becomes very challenging.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Complacency Reminiscent of 2021</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The latest price action across U.S. equities is reminiscent of what we observed during the COVID pandemic. We detect a similar type of complacency—an attitude that the market will just continue to appreciate. Human psychology makes it very difficult to sit on the sidelines while animal spirits are on display. FOMO and trend-following are ubiquitous. If there’s any doubt, one only needs to look at the parabolic moves in some of the popular trading vehicles to grasp the current market environment. For example, just look at the performance divergence between some of the popular baskets and the S&amp;P 500® Index (Illustration 24). Or perhaps the performance divergence between the S&amp;P 500® Index and a popular ETF that tracks high-growth companies with positive social media sentiment (Illustration 25).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Clients often ask about the root cause of this phenomenon. It’s hard to pinpoint one thing. Some of it can be chalked up to the rise in retail investor participation. Take for example some interesting data from the Morgan Stanley Quantitative and Derivative Strategies team. In the month of September alone, retail investors bought over $100 billion of U.S. equities based on public data, which represented the largest one-month buying spree on record. Retail investor buying is on pace to hit $800 billion by year- end. Close to 30% of daily intraday trading volume is now explained by retail investors, which is the percentage reached in 2021 during the “meme” stock craze. As Illustration 26 highlights, U.S. households’ exposure to equities reached an all-time high this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also suspect that the absence of a boom-bust cycle (e.g., Tech Bubble and GFC), which typically resets the narrative, is partly to blame. Market participants have become conditioned to anticipate accommodative policies at any signs of economic weakness. If expectations are that regulators will jump to the rescue, then what is there to lose? The Fed’s capitulation and the AI-induced spending binge have reignited the animal spirits driving the latest risk-on sentiment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451569752924.png?io=w640\" alt=\"1 year performance of S&amp;P 500 index vs. VanEck social sentiment ETF\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"371\" height=\"293\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451569752924.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451569752924.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451569752924.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451569752924.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451569752924.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451569752924.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451569752924.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451569752924.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451711937206.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Household &amp; nonprofit organizations\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"381\" height=\"297\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451711937206.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451711937206.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451711937206.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451711937206.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451711937206.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451711937206.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451711937206.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58280443-17618451711937206.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Concluding Remarks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The past two years have been a very challenging period for our team. After much self-reflection, we’ve realized that a mosaic of factors has driven the recent underperformance. Some of those have been self-inflicted wounds. We are addressing those that are generally under our control. Other factors are out of our control and are a result of market forces at play that have called into question whether a bottom-up fundamental value investment approach is viable anymore. A market that is one-dimensional and singularly focused is at odds with our investment approach, which is centered on building a diversified portfolio and being contrarian. Managers today have to decide whether to stick to their time-tested process or choose to bend the rules in an effort to limit the performance drag. We believe that overhauling our process in order to offset some of the market headwinds is a dangerous proposition. We are not certain when the market will broaden out or when market participants will pay attention to valuations. We suspect that as long as the AI-linked CapEx spending spree goes unchecked, it’s tough to imagine this trend reversing. If there is a silver lining for us, it’s that “trees don’t grow to the sky.” The band between the “haves” and “have nots” is going to get stretched to a point where something must break.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going back to the question of whether we are in a bubble. Each cycle is different; however, they often rhyme. In conclusion, we thought that we would turn to a 2017 memo authored by Howard Marks to clients. In the memo, Mr. Marks lists several attributes that he believes form the foundation of a bull market, boom or bubble. Mr. Marks titled this section of his memo “The Seeds for a Boom.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, we’ll leave it to our readers to determine whether the current market narrative is captured by any of Mr. Marks’ observations:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>A benign environment – good results lull investors into complacency, as they get used to having their positive expectations rewarded.</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gains in the recent past encourage the heated pursuit of further gains in the future (rather than suggest that past gains might have borrowed from future gains).</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>A grain of truth – the story supporting a boom isn’t created out of whole cloth; it generally coalesces around something real. The seed usually isn’t imaginary, just eventually overblown.</li> <li>Early success – the gains enjoyed by the “wise man in the beginning” – the first to seize upon the grain of truth – tends to attract “the fool in the end” who jumps in too late.</li> <li>More money than ideas – when capital is in oversupply, it is inevitable that risk aversion dries up, gullibility expands, and investment standards are relaxed.</li> <li>Willing suspension of disbelief – the quest for gain overcomes prudence and deference to history. Everyone concludes “this time it’s different.” No story is too good to be true.</li> <li>Rejection of valuation norms – all we hear is, “the asset is so great: there’s no price too high.” Buying into a fad regardless of price is the absolute hallmark of a bubble.</li> <li>The pursuit of the new – old timers fare worst in a boom, with the gains going disproportionately to those who are untrammeled by knowledge of the past and thus able to buy into an entirely new future.</li> <li>The virtuous circle – no one can see any end to the potential of the underlying truth or how high it can push the prices of related assets. It’s broadly accepted that trees can grow to the sky: “It can only go up. Nothing can stop it.” Certainly no one can picture things taking a turn for the worse.</li> <li>Fear of missing out – when all the above becomes widespread, optimism prevails and no one can imagine a glitch. That causes most people to conclude that the greatest potential error lies in failing to participate in the current market darling.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>On behalf of the Sycamore Capital team, we thank our clients for their long-term partnership and support.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>We are grateful for the trust you have placed in our Team to manage your assets.</em></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Top Contributors (%)</strong></p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Sandisk Corp.</p></td> <td><p>1.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Tower Semiconductor Ltd.</p></td> <td><p>0.7</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>NCR Atleos Corp.</p></td> <td><p>0.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Mercury Systems, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>0.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Everus Construction Group, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>0.3</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Top Detractors (%)</strong></p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Haemonetics Corp.</p></td> <td><p>-0.3</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Interparfums, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>-0.3</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Silgan Holdings, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>-0.2</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>WillScot Holdings Corp.</p></td> <td><p>-0.2</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Bowhead Specialty Holdings, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>-0.2</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><em>Source: FactSet.</em></p></td> <td> </td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Top Holdings (%)</strong></p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>United Bankshares, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>1.5</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Old National Bancorp</p></td> <td><p>1.5</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Renasant Corp.</p></td> <td><p>1.5</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>IDACORP, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>1.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>McGrath RentCorp</p></td> <td><p>1.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>UMB Financial Corp.</p></td> <td><p>1.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Tower Semiconductor Ltd.</p></td> <td><p>1.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>NCR Atleos Corp.</p></td> <td><p>1.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>MSC Industrial Direct Company, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>1.3</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>SouthState Bank Corp.</p></td> <td><p>1.3</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td><p><strong>Annualized </strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Returns</strong></p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td colspan=\"2\"> </td> </tr> <tr> <td rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>Investment Performance (%)</strong></p></td> <td rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>QTR</strong></p></td> <td rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>YTD</strong></p></td> <td rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>1-YR</strong></p></td> <td rowspan=\"2\"> </td> <td rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>3-</strong><strong>YR</strong></p></td> <td rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>5-YR</strong></p></td> <td rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>10-YR</strong></p></td> <td rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>Since Inception*</strong></p></td> <td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>Expense Ratio</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Gross</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Net</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>A-Shares (without sales charge)</p></td> <td><p>6.98</p></td> <td><p>0.69</p></td> <td><p>1.32</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>9.71</p></td> <td><p>11.95</p></td> <td><p>9.40</p></td> <td><p>9.53</p></td> <td><p>1.26</p></td> <td><p>1.26</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>A-Shares (with max. sales charge 5.75%)</p></td> <td><p>0.82</p></td> <td><p>-5.10</p></td> <td><p>-4.50</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>7.57</p></td> <td><p>10.63</p></td> <td><p>8.76</p></td> <td><p>9.28</p></td> <td><p>1.26</p></td> <td><p>1.26</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Russell 2000® Value Index</p></td> <td><p>12.60</p></td> <td><p>9.04</p></td> <td><p>7.89</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>13.56</p></td> <td><p>14.59</p></td> <td><p>9.23</p></td> <td><p>—</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan=\"3\"> <p><em>Source: Citi.

Margin improvements were primarily driven by Seagate’s focus on its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4823388-seagate-growth-runway-extends-with-large-data-center-investments\">build-to-order strategy</a>, which locks in production for known customer sales. Rather than forecasting demand and risking overcapacity that may end up as an inventory impairment, Seagate switched over to this model in 2023 to develop a more disciplined approach to engaging with the end market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As part of its strategy, Seagate incrementally increases the selling process of its hard disk drives (HDDs) with new orders, which is what led to the significant margin improvement in Q1 ’26. In addition to these improvements, the build-to-order model provides Seagate visibility into future quarters; management indicated in Q1 ’26 that demand conditions are favorable through calendar year 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth in Q1 ’26 was largely driven by the cloud services providers (CSPs), enterprise, and VIA customers, leading to a 33.63% increase in Data Center market sales. Seagate shipped 182 exabytes in Q1’26, a 32% increase when compared to the previous year’s quarter. Seagate is making good progress with its HAMR-based Mozaic platform, having qualified 5 global CSPs on the new Mozaic 3+ terabyte per disk products that can scale upwards of 36TB per drive. Seagate is in the process of qualifying 3 additional CSPs that should be concluded in calendar year 1h26. In addition to this, Seagate is qualifying CSPs for its Mozaic 4+ terabyte per disk platform, which is expected to ramp production in 1h26.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the biggest growth drivers for Seagate in terms of storage demand will likely be AI inferencing, specifically for video content generation. Accordingly, a 1-minute AI video requires 20,000x more storage capacity when compared to a 1,000-word text file. The <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/ai-video-generator-market-report\" rel=\"nofollow\">global market</a> for AI video generation is expected to grow at a 19.9% CAGR from 2024-2030, largely driven by social media platforms and the growing demand for video content over text. This could be largely driven by AI-generated advertising content, which is a feature now offered by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4825975-meta-platforms-connected-glasses-may-be-the-next-big-form-factor\">Meta Platforms</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4826710-alphabet-ups-the-capital-spend-for-ai-infrastructure-upside-is-priced-in\">Alphabet</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>). <a href=\"https://www.iab.com/news/nearly-90-of-advertisers-will-use-gen-ai-to-build-video-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\">It is estimated</a> that GenAI-generated advertisements could make up 40% of all advertising content by 2026, largely driven by high-quality digital video ads. Another large growth driver could be the further adoption of edge AI applications like Meta AI Smart Glasses, which may require significant cloud storage to support the applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another large growth driver could be enterprise adoption of agentic AI, which remains in the early stages of mass deployment. Companies like <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4822270-oracles-growth-is-set-to-accelerate-driven-by-multi-cloud-strategy\">Oracle Corp</a>.

Accordingly, Seagate is not planning to add additional production, resulting in relatively lower capacity per HDD given the relative density of the next generation of HAMR drives. Essentially, the more capacity of the HAMR drive, the fewer total drives Seagate will have the capacity to produce. This tactic ensures that the firm maintains a certain level of scarcity to support pricing per terabyte.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, I’m forecasting Seagate to generate $2.7b in net revenue, with an adjusted EPS of $2.75/share. My forecast assumes continued improvements to gross and operating margins as Seagate capitalizes on its build-to-order model and the respective pricing mechanisms. Long-term, I’m expecting the strategy to continue to scale in the coming year as new AI data center capacity comes online and as more enterprises transition to utilizing GenAI and agentic AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seagate closed Q1 ’26 with $1.1b in cash &amp; equivalent and $5.7b in debt on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STX/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a> for a leverage ratio of 1.70x net debt/aEBITDA, a significant improvement from the previous quarter’s 2.04x leverage ratio. Seagate had $2.4b in available liquidity, providing the firm with significant financial flexibility to continue to lower its debt position.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seagate experienced some inventory build in Q1 ’26, reaching 106 days of inventory on hand, up from 102 days. This is likely the result of Seagate preparing to ramp up production of Moziac 3+ to meet market demand in calendar year 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"268\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Corporate Filings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"176\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Corporate Filings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks Related to Seagate</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bull Case</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seagate is positioned to execute its margin-accretive growth strategy by implementing incremental price increases through its long-term, build-to-order contracts.

In addition to this, Seagate repurchased $29mm in share value in the quarter. Driving share value, Seagate plans to return 75% of free cash flow to shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">STX shares are currently trading at 23.79x EV/aEBITDA near the upper end of their 1-year historical trading range. One of the factors that may continue to drive new shareholder interest is that STX shares are among the <a href=\"https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance\" rel=\"nofollow\">top performing stocks</a> in the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>) year-to-date 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the strong secular growth opportunity at hand, STX shares may continue to realize growth as the firm executes its margin-accretive growth strategy. Rationalizing the share price growth trajectory, I’m expecting the valuation multiple to normalize lower as the firm grows its adjusted EBITDA over the next two years. Given this factor, I am reiterating my Strong Buy rating for STX shares with a price target of $305/share at 15.17x eFY28 EV/aEBITDA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"200\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Corporate Filings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"131\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Corporate Filings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Using the model: the valuation table above references my financial forecast in the firm’s “financial position” section and ties it to the stock’s historical trading premiums.

Moreover, Nvidia's rally accelerated after the company held its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509618-nvidia-creates-brave-new-world-as-its-chips-power-breakthroughs-across-industry-lines-gtc-dc\">GTC conference</a> this<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> week, bringing more visibility into the demand for Rubin, which seemingly positively surprised investors.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amid this massive CapEx boom, fueled by hyperscalers, however, we must ask ourselves some critical questions about whether Nvidia is still attractively valued, as it recently became the first company in the world to exceed a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510295-nvidia-makes-history-as-it-shatters-5t-market-cap-ceiling\">$5T valuation</a>. Therefore, in this article, we will explore why the current AI narrative may face some obstacles from a long-term perspective but also explain that despite these challenges, we see a good chance of the current melt-up continuing for quite some more time, given the underlying factors supporting this rally.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Previous Ratings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In general, in our previous assessments, we always carefully considered whether Nvidia's valuation was reasonable, considering future demand and relative valuation based on future earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2022 and throughout 2024, we had a clear picture that demand would significantly exceed supply and decided to remain optimistic. However, at the end of 2024/beginning of 2025, we believed that the future demand curve was becoming less visible and that the fundamental factors had peaked in their historical range. Therefore, at the end of last year, we decided to assign sell ratings in the range of $129.57 to $134.25. In hindsight, we must admit that we may have judged too early that the peak had been reached.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1793\" data-height=\"989\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nvidia Price 2021 to 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"353\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>TradingView</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4744133-nvidia-stock-would-you-believe-trees-dont-grow-to-the-sky\">latest article</a>, titled “Nvidia Stock: Would You Believe Trees Don't Grow To The Sky,” we based our cautious stance on data from some of the other largest historical CapEx cycles, such as the mainframe era in the late 1960s with International Business Machines Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\" title=\"International Business Machines Corporation\">IBM</a>) and the dot-com bubble with Cisco Systems, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSCO\" title=\"Cisco Systems, Inc.\">CSCO</a>), Lucent, and Nortel. In these cases, the capital expenditures of these companies exceeded 13% of total market spending, and Nvidia is now also starting to reach the same order of magnitude.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And although we saw a pullback earlier this year in April due to geopolitical risks, Nvidia has rebounded strongly. At the time of writing, we should perhaps have placed more emphasis on the echo among hyperscaler CEOs that the risk of underinvesting is much greater than that of overinvesting and that this rally indeed has even more room to run.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">No Signs Of A Slowdown (Yet)</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, we believe the results continue to be positively surprising. In terms of revenue, for example, data center revenue rose 56% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year and now stands at $41.10BN.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This also means that of Nvidia's total revenue, which was $46.74BN last quarter, data center revenue accounts for nearly 88% of Nvidia's total revenue. However, one area that surprised many investors was the resurgence of Nvidia's gaming segment, which rose from $2.88BN in the second quarter of last year to a new record of $4.29BN, partly due to the success of the launch of the Nintendo Co., Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTDOY\" title=\"Nintendo Co., Ltd.\">OTCPK:NTDOY</a>) Switch 2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2400\" data-height=\"1700\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nvidia Revenue Breakdown\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"453\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>S&amp;P Market Intelligence, Author's Visuals</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a profitability perspective, Nvidia also appears to be running at full speed in the second quarter, with GAAP gross margins of 72.4% and operating margins of 60.8%, following a temporary dip in the previous quarter due to restrictions on H20 sales to China at that time. This means that operating income in the second quarter came in at $28.44BN, a 52.56% increase from the $18.64BN reported in the same quarter last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at core profitability, Nvidia is now generating $72.02BN in free cash flow on a TTM (trailing 12-months) basis according to the latest reports, or a multiple of nearly 70x, considering the market capitalization of $5.03T, which we believe is quite expensive but does not consider the future growth we will discuss later. A large portion of this free cash flow is used to buy back shares. The company has repurchased a whopping $42.05BN worth of shares over the past 12 months. In addition, the company approved a $60BN buyback plan in August, while at the time of reporting it still had $14.7BN in capacity left to repurchase shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2400\" data-height=\"1700\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nvidia Gross Margins and Operating Margins\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"453\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>S&amp;P Market Intelligence, Author's Visuals</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margins are expected to improve in the second half of this year as the Blackwell ramp begins to level off. According to management, GAAP gross margins will be around 75% at the end of fiscal year 2026. As for Blackwell, we were surprised by the smooth ramp from Hopper, given the increased product launch frequency.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Melt-Up Has Arrived</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One thing is certain, and that is that we did not foresee the extent to which hyperscalers would defend their position in the lucrative data center industry when the shift from serial to parallel computing took place.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also did not expect Nvidia to use its own free cash flow to provide venture capital or investments to AI companies that depend on Nvidia's chips, such as Mistral, OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>), CoreWeave, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWV\" title=\"CoreWeave, Inc.\">CRWV</a>), and others, which we believe are capable of prolonging this capital cycle and even making it more extreme.

The key difference, however, is that current spending is largely financed with equity, cash flow, or venture capital rather than debt. This, in our view, leaves much more room for a potential bubble than in 2000, when companies faced credit risks as spreads widened until 2002.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We would also be wary of any bottlenecks that could arise in the coming months as Blackwell's rollout reaches critical mass, as both the scale and speed of the computer rollout are unprecedented.

More aggressive global estimates, as reported by <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-energy-use\" rel=\"nofollow\">the IEEE</a>, put demand at 347 TWh in 2030, which is equivalent to 44 nuclear reactors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After all, Nvidia and hyperscalers also run the risk that energy costs, which are part of input costs, could make AI implementation even less profitable at a time when LLM providers such as OpenAI are already burning through cash on a large scale. By way of comparison, Nvidia, with a valuation of $5T, is currently worth much more than the entire <a href=\"https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/sector/energy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">energy sector</a>, which consists of 256 companies and has a valuation of $3.57T.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We believe that the market is also anticipating announced future developments in data centers, as companies have announced plans to deploy up to 120 GW of capacity. Essentially, we believe that the market may be underestimating the execution risk, as companies have already incorporated these massive CapEx cycles into their forecasts through 2030 and beyond, while active growth in data center capacity is only just beginning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"746\" data-height=\"465\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AI Data Center Deployment versus Announced Developments\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"399\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Goldman Sachs, Aterio</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some Thoughts On Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the early stages of this AI boom, we were reasonably satisfied with Nvidia's valuation, as demand was extremely inelastic despite high trailing multiples and revenue growth forecasts were in the triple digits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Towards the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4640631-nvidia-stanley-druckenmiller-is-right-about-ai-rating-upgrade\">end of 2023</a>, for example, we gave a Strong Buy rating based on future multiples.

These estimates imply growth in estimated EBITDA from $127.58BN at the end of this year to $176.87BN, which prices in a lot of certainty for the realization of Rubin orders but seems quite reasonable to us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, at the DTC developer conference, Jensen Huang announced that Blackwell and Rubin together had <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nvidias-huang-speak-washington-investors-look-hints-china-2025-10-28/\" rel=\"nofollow\">$500BN in orders</a> through the end of 2026 so far, which likely translates to $300BN in data revenue in calendar year 2026 alone. This also seems to be in line with Wall Street estimates, which may actually be conservative, with expected revenues of $206.13BN for fiscal year 2026 and $270.28BN for fiscal year 2027. To our understanding, these orders through 2026, while not guaranteed, are supported by the construction costs outside the Nvidia chips that hyperscalers have already committed to, including energy contracts, land transactions, network equipment, construction costs, and others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although many who speak of a bubble expect a downturn to occur soon, we believe it is more likely to be a story for 2027.

In this case, it may therefore be better to look at price action to determine when the cycle is about to turn, rather than waiting for news about hyperscalers starting to cut costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of valuation, we are uncomfortable paying 30x forward EV/EBITDA based on 2026 estimates, as we expect revenue normalization to continue after 2027, when hyperscalers and venture capitalists begin to evaluate the limitations and cost-effectiveness currently associated with AI. Furthermore, there remains considerable uncertainty about the cyclical nature of these CapEx cycles, which are driven by demand from hyperscalers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We serve as a reminder that not so long ago, in 2022, Nvidia faced a downturn of more than 66%, which in our view was also attributable to cyclical factors related to retail GPUs being used to mine cryptocurrencies at the time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2f1be3a957eeb723a0ccd917e7dfedf7.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2f1be3a957eeb723a0ccd917e7dfedf7.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2f1be3a957eeb723a0ccd917e7dfedf7.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2f1be3a957eeb723a0ccd917e7dfedf7.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2f1be3a957eeb723a0ccd917e7dfedf7.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2f1be3a957eeb723a0ccd917e7dfedf7.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2f1be3a957eeb723a0ccd917e7dfedf7.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2f1be3a957eeb723a0ccd917e7dfedf7.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2f1be3a957eeb723a0ccd917e7dfedf7.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the outlook remains stable, we would therefore be more prudent with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 21x 2027 for Nvidia. This would imply an enterprise value of $3.71T, which, after adjusting for $46.19BN worth of net debt, consisting largely of cash and cash equivalents, equates to a valuation of $3.76T or approximately $154 per share. This would still give investors some margin of safety in the event of a decline in spending or a stabilization of hardware spending in 2027 and 2028.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In our view, investors are paying a premium for uncertainty today, expecting this cycle to last much longer with higher growth rates than earlier in late 2023/early 2024, when you could buy the company at a discount for 16x forward EV/EBITDA as investors were factoring in the possibility of a downturn in hyperscaler CapEx spend. Even more recently, in April 2025 during the trade war, Nvidia's multiple compressed all the way down to 18x EV/EBITDA on a forward basis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Is This Time Different?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our skepticism about this broader AI rally is mainly based on the idea that right now, as most venture-backed AI companies like OpenAI scale up, losses are also growing at an alarming rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OpenAI, for example, with ChatGPT as one of the most widely used AI tools available, is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-first-half-revenue-rises-16-about-43-billion-information-reports-2025-09-30/\" rel=\"nofollow\">expected to burn</a> through $8BN in cash this year alone and will double this cash consumption to $17BN next year. Furthermore, according to certain sources, they expect to burn <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/06/openai-business-to-burn-115-billion-through-2029-the-information.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">through $115BN</a> in cash through 2029 and are not expected to have positive free cash flow until 2029. In contrast, the company generated an estimated $4.3BN in revenue in the first half of 2025, or $8.6BN on an annualized basis, although it is targeting $13BN in revenue for 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This reminds us of the Metaverse project, in which Meta had invested <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/29236/operating-loss-of-metas-reality-labs-division/?srsltid=AfmBOoocNguh2NuVvTCRR_h-REvGYAewMtP06CjDxHT8JpTKEP18-vKw\" rel=\"nofollow\">approximately $70BN</a> in its \"Reality Labs\" at one point, while revenue at the end of 2024 was still only about $2.35BN on an annualized basis. While, on the one hand, we consider the marginal utility of OpenAI's products to be much greater than that of the Metaverse project, it remains to be seen how much revenue these services will actually generate, whether it will even be profitable to do so in terms of unit economics, and how fast and difficult the adoption phase will actually be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"575\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Goldman Sachs OpenAI Unit Economics\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"288\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Goldman Sachs</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To return once again to the parallel with the dot-com bubble: unlike in the late 1990s, when there was a veritable rush to float cash-guzzling technology companies such as Pets.com, much of the current waste and losses remain opaque, as a large proportion of it is financed by venture capital in private entities.

Although Jensen Huang recently emphasized <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">at GTC</a> that part of Blackwell will be built in the US, for example at the new TSMC factories in Arizona, SK hynix Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HXSCF\" title=\"SK hynix Inc.\">OTCPK:HXSCF</a>) in <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/03/05/news-tsmcs-100-billion-u-s-investment-puts-pressure-on-samsung-and-sk-hynixs-next-move/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Indiana</a>, or Foxconn Technology Co., Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FXCOF\" title=\"Foxconn Technology Co., Ltd.\">OTCPK:FXCOF</a>) in Texas, we believe that dependence on the Asian supply chain remains crucial, as high bandwidth memory (HBM) is mainly produced in Asia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, Nvidia remains dependent on Taiwan for advanced packaging (CoWoS) and currently still has to send chips produced in the United States <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/nvidia-and-tsmc-produce-the-first-blackwell-wafer-made-in-the-u-s-chips-still-need-to-be-shipped-back-to-taiwan-to-complete-the-final-product\" rel=\"nofollow\">back to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>) in Taiwan.

The latest SEC report states that 35% of total revenue can be attributed to two customers.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>For the first half of fiscal year 2026, sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 20% of total revenue; and sales to a second direct customer, Customer B, represented 15% of total revenue, respectively, both of which were attributable to the Compute &amp; Networking segment. (SEC, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001045810/000104581025000209/nvda-20250727.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q2 Earnings Filing</a>).</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, we also cannot rule out competitive risks for Nvidia, as hyperscalers, given the current <a href=\"https://iot-analytics.com/leading-generative-ai-companies/\" rel=\"noopener\">market share of 94%</a> for discrete GPUs, are also keen to avoid dependence on Nvidia alone, which is seriously eating away at their bottom line. As for Nvidia's lead <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA\" rel=\"nofollow\">with CUDA</a> in the field of training models, this still appears to be very stable, given the lack of acceptance and momentum of other alternatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, in terms of inference, there are still AWS with <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-says-anthropic-will-use-1-million-of-its-custom-ai-chips-141829311.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trainium2 chips</a>, Google's TPUs, which they also use internally for training, and AMD's Instinct chips, which could eventually erode some of Nvidia's 92% market share in AI data center GPUs to <a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2025/09/29/data-infrastructure/metas-infrastructure-evolution-and-the-advent-of-ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">counter vendor lock-in</a>. Although AMD is stepping up its efforts, it will remain difficult in the short to medium term to overcome some of Nvidia's physical advantages, such as InfiniBand and NVLink. On the other hand, there has been more interest in using AMD lately. For example, OpenAI <a href=\"https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1260/amd-and-openai-announce-strategic-partnership-to-deploy-6-gigawatts-of-amd-gpus\" rel=\"nofollow\">recently announced</a> that it plans to use 6 gigawatts of AMD computing power.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, demand for Blackwell appears to be surprisingly high, and we are also pleasantly surprised by the visibility of demand for Rubin. Interest among hyperscalers remains high but is likely to be quite volatile in the future, as the AI narrative may encounter some obstacles along the way in terms of questions about economic aspects, energy supply, and the overall pace of adoption and implementation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We are convinced that AI will eventually transform industries in terms of automation, but the pace of adoption and implementation remains highly uncertain, as LLM providers continue to <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/03/anthropic_funding/\" rel=\"nofollow\">spend exponentially</a> more money as they expand their capacity. Nevertheless, we are not so sure that we can expect a downturn in Nvidia's underlying fundamentals before 2026, given the current commitments already made by hyperscalers.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, this melt-up could continue for a while, as the factors driving the rally remain favorable. In our opinion, an entry point with a reasonable margin of safety around $154 per share would be interesting until there is more clarity about the acceptance of AI and the improvement of unit economics at the implementation level. We therefore assign Nvidia at Hold.</p>",

Joining us now to discuss, Andrew Kelvin, Managing Director and Head of Canadian and Global Rates Strategy at TD Securities.</p> <p>Great to have you back on the program.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> Thank you for having me.</p> <p><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> Strong indication here. I know this was the call from TD Securities heading into this. We get a 25 basis point cut, and that's it. That's the end. They've hit their terminal rate, he's indicating pretty strongly there. What would it take to move them off that sideline?</p> <p><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> Yeah, I will say I was a little bit surprised they were as explicit as they were about expecting that they were done with this easing cycle at this level. I would have thought they would have been a little bit more cagey about it, maybe preserve a little bit more optionality for future meetings. But I think the fact that they were so transparent about how they're viewing the future policy path tells you that there's a very, very high bar for them to cut rates again in December. Presumably, this has some sort of relationship to the upcoming federal budget, which is expected broadly to be stimulative. And it would make sense if you're the central bank to not be easing immediately after a rather stimulative budget.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, in order to get them off of this hold that they've sort of communicated they're in, the answer is really simple. The governor was saying that if conditions change, they will reevaluate their path, which is what you would both hope and expect. December, I feel pretty comfortable with the idea that December is a hold. They would not have been as explicit in their communication if they thought there was a reasonable chance of a December cut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And again, it has that sort of proximity to the budget. Even January, it's not clear to me that we're going to have a good indication as to what the stimulative impacts of that budget will be. If the economy is flagging a little bit in January, we will still have the potential boost coming from announced stimulus into 2026 to comfort policymakers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But if we get into the spring-- so I'm really looking at March, April, June meetings-- and growth is not above its trend rate, if we're still seeing excess capacity in the economy grow, at that point the Bank of Canada, I think, will have to reconsider if this is, in fact, the floor for interest rates in this cycle. And if it turns out that the drag on the economy from the trade dispute with the United States is a little bit worse, if trading conditions with the United States become worse than they are today, that would be something that would cause them to reconsider.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And when I say worse than they are today, I'm not talking about just that sort of presumptive 10% additional reciprocal tariff. I'm talking about something that's more broadly punitive for a wider swath of the Canadian economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> Seem to be in a bit of a tough place because they are recognizing, of course, that they can't solve a trade war just through monetary policy. But sometimes a trade war can send prices higher, but a weaker economy, they think all of that weighs out, keeps prices in check. Are they being a little too optimistic on inflation being contained, considering everything we're facing?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> The reason-- I think it's actually a very reasonable set of forecasts they have. And I would say that on both the growth and inflation side. We can't solve a change in our trading relationship with monetary policy. What monetary policy can do is smooth that adjustment. It can make that adjustment less painful, which is why these sorts of moves are appropriate in my mind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of how inflation is going forward, I think the reason why I'm pretty comfortable with the idea inflation will be contained around 2%-- I never want to put a firm 2.0, so somebody can point their finger at me and say I'm wrong if it's 2.1.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To me, a perhaps overlooked thing in the structural change the Canadian economy is going under right now is the change in population growth. We had obviously very strong population growth in recent years, which is one of the factors that helped contribute to rising rents, rising shelter prices broadly. If we are going to remain in an environment where population growth is very, very weak, close to 0, we shouldn't have those same upward pressures on shelter prices. We shouldn't have those same upward pressures on rents.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And shelter's a huge part of the CPI basket. So if we're going to be in an environment where population growth is very weak, that should prevent runaway shelter price inflation. And that in and of itself should be enough to keep inflation around 2%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> Now, you mentioned the structural changes that we're undergoing because of the trade tensions and how the relationship is probably not going to be the same going forward. Well, it's not the same right now with the US. Governor Macklem mentioned it as well. Once we get through these structural changes, what does our economy look like on the other side?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> So it's probably an economy where the level of activity in the economy is just lower than it otherwise would have been. The way I tend to think about these things is you have a drag on growth in year 1 and 2. And even if you see growth return to its previous levels, you still have this sort of permanent gap between where the level of activity could have been and where you are now. And additionally, they did highlight that they look at these changing trade relationships as something that will drag on potential GDP. So having weaker terms of-- weaker trading conditions, weaker ability to trade with the US, less open market access is something that will drag potentially permanently on Canadian growth in their mind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So they see us transitioning to a lower-growth economy due to the fact that we will have less open trading conditions with the US going forward, just assuming that the current conditions move forward. If we are able to strike some sort of a grand bargain and go back to the world the way it was, in November, just in terms of what the actual tariffs charged are, what the actual market access is, obviously, a lot of that drag sort of disappears, and we can return to that previous economic trajectory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One point I would just make, though, is one of the values of a trade deal is it provides certainty. Businesses can look at the trade deal, trust that the terms of market access will remain constant, and make investments and decisions with the long term in mind. Going forward, even if we get a deal in the next day, week, month, quarter, year, whatever--</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> We had a deal under the first Trump administration, right?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> So yeah, pick your time horizon. I don't think people will be quite as willing to just accept that this will be a long-term deal, which they were in the first USMCA. I think when the first USMCA was signed, people had assumed that that deal would hold. And I'm quite certain-- I probably came on your show and said in 2024, I was like, well, Donald Trump signed USMCA one, so surely he won't tear it up. And then fast forward to today and he has largely moved away from that deal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So it is something where we probably never fully unring that bell. It probably does speak to an economy where, absent other positive developments, we're in a bit more of a slow-growth environment, which is probably why you see the federal government so focused on taking measures to boost productivity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> Talk about that. I mean, that puts a lot of pressure on next week's federal budget, doesn't it, to show us something that this economy needs? What do we need to see from that budget?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> The budget is probably having too much asked of it at this point. The federal government is in a fairly enviable position, just in that 15 to 20 years of reasonably responsible fiscal policy in Canada. I mean that the governments over in the post-pandemic era have had a lot of fiscal room. Our net federal debt to GDP is quite low. So this government can come out with a 2, 2.5% budget deficit as a share of GDP without really roiling markets. And I think markets are quite positioned for what could be quite a large deficit in this upcoming budget.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problem I think the government faces here is that a lot of the measures that they would like to take to boost productivity-- cutting red tape. Their first bill, the first signature bill they passed when they came into parliament before the summer recess was about streamlining projects of national importance. And that's all well and good, cutting red tape is all-- I've never heard an argument for red tape. I'm sure it exists, but no one's ever said it to me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That sort of effort is the sort of thing that can pay dividends down the road. Cutting approval timelines to make sure that shovels can be in the ground within two years or five years, or whatever the timeframe is is a great thing that can help boost productivity and growth once those shovels start hitting the ground and once the project's complete, whether it's a mine, a port expansion, a nuclear plant, what have you. The problem is, I don't see how any of these things are terribly helpful in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So I think the real task for this budget is they have to balance three things. They have to balance setting the stage to actually boost future productivity growth. They need to take some measures to fill the gap in aggregate demand that is going to persist into 2026, because I think if the government comes out and their entire budget is focused around measures to boost activity four, five, six years down the line-- again, thinking long term is great, but it doesn't help the economy in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> You want to see something right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> So they'll need something to help bridge that gap between when these long-term capital investments start to produce growth and the trouble the economy is facing in adjusting right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And the third thing they'll need to do is probably follow through a little bit on some of the \"spend less\" parts of their slogan. They have talked about cutting the size of the civil service, reducing operating costs, whether it be through more use of technology or reducing consultants, whatever the mode they do is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They have to balance all these three things, and they don't all pull in the same direction. There's a balance between whether to invest for the long term or the short term. Do want to spend for the long term or the short term? How much new spending do you want to have that is effectively offset by operating cost reductions? Because there is no free cost cutting. Anytime you reduce operating costs for a government, that does have negative implications for the economy. Maybe it's not one for one. There is no pure dead weight that can just be cut here.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.moneytalkgo.com/video/boc-signals-its-rate-cut-cycle-may-be-finished/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p>",

The performance reflects an approximated 7% increase in pricing as Hershey has raised prices to account for cocoa inflation, only slightly offset by a small -1% decline in sales volume.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the decline, the segment’s sales volume performance is very strong in my opinion – I also <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834762-mondelez-focusing-on-cocoa-deflation-after-weak-q3-rating-upgrade\">covered</a> Mondelez International, Inc.'s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDLZ\" title=\"Mondelez International, Inc.\">MDLZ</a>) Q3 results, noting a much more significant -4.6% sales volume decline for the competitor. Mondelez noted higher than expected demand elasticity in the face of price increases, but Hershey’s demand has remained very resilient despite similar pricing actions. Hershey noted a more than 10 basis point retail market share gain in <a href=\"https://hershey.gcs-web.com/static-files/cc69098f-155b-4ecd-827b-6d4a9850e4e5\" rel=\"nofollow\">prepared remarks</a> with strength in the Jolly Rancher, Hershey, Cadbury, and Reese’s brands. Product innovation has driven strong retail-level sales, highlighting Hershey's strong brand portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">North America Salty Snacks also had a strong performance; the segment’s sales grew by 10.0% to $321 million, reflecting a massive 11 percentage point sales volume gain. Hershey’s promotional timing, media investments, and product innovation drove the segment’s good performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hershey's revenues also performed well in other markets; the International segment showed 12.1% revenue growth to $245 million, reflecting a 7% pricing increase and 6% growth in sales volume. Shipment timings in Europe and Mexico did contribute a part of the good volume gain as shipments moved from Q4 to Q3; underlying consumption seems to still have been subdued due to demand elasticity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hershey does note that the company has had a disappointing early Halloween performance, related by the company to warmer weather and seasonality effects. The overall sales signal from the Q3 report was still strong; on top of a strong Q3 across segments, Hershey raised the 2025 sales growth outlook to 3% from <em>at least 2%</em> previously.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margins Have Been a Compromise</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hershey’s margins suffered massively in Q3 due to significantly higher cocoa prices – profitability has been a clear compromise as the industry’s pricing power is clearly limited in the face of demand elasticity. The adjusted gross margin showed an 850 basis point decline to 31.8%, reflecting a mix of higher cocoa prices and tariffs. Higher input costs were not even nearly offset by Hershey’s price actions. Mondelez did show an even more significant 1010 basis point gross margin drop in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike Mondelez, though, Hershey didn’t manage SG&amp;A as prudently – Hershey’s operating expenses grew by 1.5% year-on-year. Adjusted operating income ended up declining by -35.4% to $423 million. The quarter’s $1.30 adjusted EPS still beat Wall Street’s consensus by $0.24 due to already subdued expectations in the current inflationary operating environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability issues shift the focus to cocoa deflation. As I also wrote in my article on Mondelez, cocoa prices have started to fall back due to improved crops. Cocoa futures stand at $6000 per tonne at the time of writing, at less than half the December 2024 peak. The 2025/26 season is expected to already show a cocoa supply surplus; while cocoa prices remain significantly high, recent months’ deflation should start to provide a pathway for a margin recovery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hershey’s earnings recovery is still likely to be very gradual, being largely dependent on competitors’ pricing, new developments in the cocoa market, and consumers’ demand elasticity going forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hershey’s Valuation Has a Fair Margin of Safety</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I updated my discounted cash flow (DCF) model for Hershey. I very slightly raised my revenue estimates, now implying a 2024-2034 CAGR of 2.7%. I now estimate the EBIT margin to stabilize at 21% from 2029 forward, suggesting a margin recovery in the 2026-2028 period due to cocoa deflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hershey’s cash flow conversion should stay healthy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1076\" data-height=\"338\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"fair value estimate hershey stock\" width=\"640\" height=\"201\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">DCF Model <span>(Author's Calculation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The estimates put Hershey’s fair value at $210.9, 23% above the stock price at the time of writing.

I again assume quite a modest 15% long-term debt-to-equity ratio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For cost of equity, I use the 10-year bond <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y?s=us10y\">yield of 4.09%</a> as the risk-free rate. The equity risk premium of 4.62% is Professor Aswath Damodaran’s most recent July <a href=\"https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/\" rel=\"nofollow\">estimate</a> for the US. I have kept the beta estimate at 0.45. With a liquidity premium of 0.2%, the cost of equity stands at 6.37% and the WACC at 5.91%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hershey reported strong sales in Q3 as consumer demand stayed surprisingly resilient amid significant cocoa inflation. The company’s main brands are performing strongly. Yet, the quarter also underlines the industry’s struggles; margins were again a compromise to protect sales as Hershey’s earnings plummeted. Recent months’ cocoa deflation should start to rebound earnings, but at an uncertain timeframe.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">HSY stock has a fair margin of safety in its valuation, and I remain at a Hold rating.</p>",

Growth was primarily driven by higher average revenue per user (ARPU) in the former and stronger demand from the largest customers in the latter.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618228853852515_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"693\" data-height=\"316\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618228853852515_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Microsoft revenue growth by segment\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"292\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618228853852515_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618228853852515_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618228853852515_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618228853852515_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618228853852515_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618228853852515_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618228853852515_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618228853852515_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Prepared by the author, using data from earnings releases</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The outlook for the second quarter of FY 2026 was roughly in line with expectations, with revenue expected to be in the 14% to 16% range. At present, the forward revenue growth estimate by sell-side analysts is almost 15%, which is exactly the mid-point of the range. Gross margin, on the other hand, is expected to drop, but economies of scale would allow MSFT to retain its operating margin flat—something that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4823670-amazon-2-reasons-why-its-not-a-good-ai-play\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4823670-amazon-2-reasons-why-its-not-a-good-ai-play\" target=\"_blank\">other peers</a> in the cloud infrastructure space might have a hard time achieving.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>(...) we expect revenue of USD 79.5 billion to USD 80.6 billion or growth of 14% to 16%. We expect COGS of USD 26.35 billion to USD 26.55 billion or growth of 21% to 22%. And operating expense of USD 17.3 billion to USD 17.4 billion, growth of 7% to 8%. Operating margins should be relatively flat year-over-year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality.</p> <p>Source: MSFT Q1 2026 Earnings Transcript</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the Q1 report falls in the category of better-than-anticipated, and the initial negative share price reaction is likely linked to one of the issues that was highlighted a few months ago, namely the beginning of the market to price-in flat operating margins going forward. In spite of all the good news around MSFT in recent months, this is also the reason why the share price remained flat over the past three months as the Nasdaq Composite Index skyrocketed by 16%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Big Picture</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nothing has changed over the past few months, and I retain my Hold rating on MSFT due to the issues mentioned in my last analysis. Although the Q1 report was quite good, I anticipate a muted share price reaction to other such earnings releases in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, long-term investors who are willing to forego short-term underperformance and retain a long position in the company should do their best not to miss the forest for the trees. In other words, quarterly numbers could go in either direction in relation to the short-term analysts' estimates, but what truly matters for MSFT now is to remain positioned as a leader in generative AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, the section about OpenAI in each earnings release is becoming increasingly important. In the latest report, it was the details given about the new agreement with OpenAI as it undergoes a very important restructuring process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the AI landscape evolves, OpenAI and Microsoft needed to alter their existing relationship in order for each one of them to achieve more freedom in certain areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a nutshell, there are two entities: a non-profit one called OpenAI Foundation and a for-profit organization called OpenAI Group PBC. MSFT holds a stake in the latter, which is <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/next-chapter-of-microsoft-openai-partnership/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://openai.com/index/next-chapter-of-microsoft-openai-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\">valued</a> at $135bn. According to MSFT management, the company has already 10x-ed their investments made in the company since 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the value of MSFT's stake is bound to continue increasing, there have been a number of announcements made regarding the relationship.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Firstly, MSFT would continue to have exclusive IP rights and Azure exclusivity on API (Application Programming Interface) products, and OpenAI has committed to an incremental $250bn investment in Azure services. The new structure also gives MSFT rights to OpenAI's IP and models through 2032 or once an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is declared and verified by an expert panel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Secondly, MSFT can now pursue AGI on its own or with third parties, and the same goes for some products developed by OpenAI. For non-API products, OpenAI will be free to use any other cloud provider as it sees fit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, this new organization gives OpenAI some freedom to more easily raise capital and pursue an IPO in the coming years.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w640\" alt=\"OpenAI upcoming IPO\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"619\" height=\"148\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although ChatGPT is still leading by a very wide margin in terms of market share, the competition within the AI-powered products will intensify significantly in the coming years, with all major players announcing significant <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510958-alphabet-signals-91b-93b-2025-capex-amid-ai-driven-growth-surge\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510958-alphabet-signals-91b-93b-2025-capex-amid-ai-driven-growth-surge\" target=\"_blank\">increases</a> in investments. Thus, the deal with OpenAI could give MSFT a much-needed freedom in further developing its own frontier models. It also opens up the space for other cloud infrastructure vendors to contract workloads from OpenAI.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Microsoft remains one of my favorite picks within the cloud and software sector, alongside my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821698-oracle-blockbuster-earnings-separating-the-business-from-the-stock-price\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821698-oracle-blockbuster-earnings-separating-the-business-from-the-stock-price\" target=\"_blank\">long-time favorite</a>—Oracle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>). Having said that, recent events confirm my fears that the share price does not offer much upside in the near term as investor expectations have already priced-in much of the business momentum. More importantly, however, the latest earnings release shows that quarterly figures are far less relevant for Microsoft's future than the company's strategic positioning in generative AI.</p>",
