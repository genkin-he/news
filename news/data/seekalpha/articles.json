The fund commands a 5% dividend yield, as the market environment in recent years has been quite favorable to the fund’s investors, where the yield<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> picked up significantly due to the elevated interest rate environment. The yield is also enhanced by the option trading strategy on the SPX index, which generates additional income to the underlying ultra-short T-bill exposure. As a result, the fund delivers superior returns in its segment and appears as an attractive tool for income investors amid the ongoing macro uncertainty. I am bullish on CSHI ETF shares, as my calculations indicate that the fund could deliver up to a 5% return over the next 12-month horizon.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NEOS Enhanced Income 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF is <a href=\"https://neosfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/CSHI-Summary-Prospectus.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://neosfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/CSHI-Summary-Prospectus.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">established</a> to invests in a portfolio of very short-term US Treasury bonds with maturities between 1 and 3 months.

CSHI generates a high dividend yield for its investors, which conforms to the elevated benchmark interest rate environment in recent years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund distributed $2.50 per share over the last 12-month period, which indicates a 5% dividend yield. The fund also provides the highest dividend yield among the ultra-short-term ETFs, where iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SGOV\" title=\"iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF\">SGOV</a>) and State Street SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIL\" title=\"State Street SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF\">BIL</a>) generate 4% yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, the option strategy is delivering prominent benefits, which makes CSHI an attractive position compared to other ETFs. The option strategy is designed to enhance the return that the fund earns from T-bills by trading put credit spreads (or bull put spreads). The strategy generates positive returns in rising and flat equity markets and may generate a positive return in equity markets that are modestly declining, assuming the net premium collected from the options sold and purchased exceeds the net cost to close the positions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the fund’s portfolio, the total assets amount to $928 million, with 99% of it allocated to treasury bills. The fund also holds eight option positions with maturity on 03/05/2026 with strike prices ranging between 5875 and 6250 for the long put options and 6150 to 6425 for the short put options.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179278356473_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"945\" data-height=\"502\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179278356473_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Portfolio holdings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179278356473_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179278356473_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179278356473_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179278356473_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Portfolio holdings <span>(fund manager)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that the S&amp;P 500 value is around 6890 points, the options are well out of the money. Note that the bull put spread builds upon a bullish narrative by initiating a short put option on a higher strike to maximize the received premium and a long put option on a lower strike to protect from adverse movement in the S&amp;P 500 index. Hence, the maximum profit of the strategy is the net premium received, achieved when options expire OTM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking into the above table, we can notice that the fund received $16.36 per unit in the contract (paid $11.04 and received $27.40). This brings the total net premium proceeds to $553k, given that there are 338 contracts for each position and 100 units per contract. Compared to the total AUM of close to $1 billion, it doesn’t seem like a big gain from the option strategy, but keep in mind that the option contracts are with a weekly expiration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, the main part of the dividend distribution is generated through the T-bills portfolio. So forecasting the future return requires an assumption about the level and the dynamics of the benchmark dollar interest rate over the investment horizon. During the January meeting, the Federal Reserve kept its interest rate unchanged for the first time since September of last year, or in the range of 3.50%-3.75%. The central bank officials seem hesitant to rush with further rate cuts. However, the futures suggest that the main scenario remains further rate cuts. In particular, CME futures currently imply a rate cut of approximately 50 basis points from the current level down to 3.00-3.25% over the next 12-month horizon. However, it should be noted that the change in the Fed chair has increased the uncertainty surrounding the rate outlook. The <a href=\"https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2026-2-24-the-warsh-shock-nomination-of-kevin-warsh-as-fed-chair-signals-aggressive-balance-sheet-pivot-and-2026-rate-normalization\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2026-2-24-the-warsh-shock-nomination-of-kevin-warsh-as-fed-chair-signals-aggressive-balance-sheet-pivot-and-2026-rate-normalization\" target=\"_blank\">nomination</a> of Kevin Warsh marks a definitive end to the \"Powell Era\" and ushers in a new doctrine of monetary discipline characterized by an aggressive reduction of the central bank's multi-trillion-dollar balance sheet. This creates additional macroeconomic uncertainty, where the quantitative tightening would be combined with interest rate cuts.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179600802166_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"945\" data-height=\"410\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179600802166_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Target rate probabilities for March 2027\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"278\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179600802166_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179600802166_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179600802166_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179600802166_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Target rate probabilities for March 2027 <span>(cmegroup)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's assume that the fund generates a 3.5% return over the next 12 months. Given inflation expectations, such an investment should generate a positive real return. Let's note another important point. CSHI returns are driven predominantly by interest rates and are virtually independent of their movements. The average duration of the securities in its portfolio is close to zero due to the ultra-short T-bills. This essentially excludes interest rate risk, meaning the fund provides an excellent hedge against market volatility.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk factors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund gives exposure to T-bills, which are deemed to be reasonably safe assets. However, due to the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and in case of a recession, the US central bank could resort to sharper interest rate cuts, which could decrease the investment return of the fund’s investors. In addition, the negative macro development and bearish sentiment could disrupt the fund’s option strategy, which is not effective during stock market downturns.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taking the current market expectation regarding the interest rates over the next 12-month horizon, the average rate is still around 3.50%. In addition, the fund could generate good profits from the option strategy. However, it’s hard to make any assumptions regarding the strategy return, but if we annualize the current net premium income, the option overlay could deliver up to a 2.86% return. As a result, I will initiate a Buy recommendation on CSHI, which has the potential to deliver up to a 5% return over the next one-year investment horizon. I find the NEOS Enhanced Income 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF as an attractive investment opportunity, as the fund provides virtually risk-free returns to its holders generated from investing in a portfolio of ultra-short T-bills and enhanced by a low-risk profile put option strategy. As a result, CHSI provides a good opportunity to earn up to a 5% return and hedge market volatility caused by macro and geopolitical uncertainty, an unclear monetary policy path, and record tech valuation. In addition, the fund could be a valuable tool for income investors trying to hedge the purchase of long-term bonds, which are the main beneficiaries of monetary policy normalization, by opening a position in securities with low interest rate risk.</p>",

While retail investors were panicking due to the collapse in the price of gold, COMEX data indicates that investors are accumulating gold options with strike prices of $15,000 and $20,000, and what is most interesting is that this occurred while prices plummeted from $5,600 to less than $5,000. There are more than 11,000 contracts.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59387725-17720423078542852_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"886\" data-height=\"549\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59387725-17720423078542852_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Open Interest\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"397\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59387725-17720423078542852_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59387725-17720423078542852_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59387725-17720423078542852_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59387725-17720423078542852_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Open Interest <span>(Comex, CME, Bloomberg)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In parallel, gold stocks on the Shanghai exchange soared to a record 104 tons.

On a reported basis, sales were down by 40 basis points. This was mainly due to negative FX. The group's EBIT margin, excluding the energy impact, rose by 80 basis points to 20.7%. There was an EBIT acceleration in H2 compared to H1 results. There is evidence of operating leverage, given that on a comparable basis, operating profit growth exceeded sales growth (+7.6% vs. +2%). These results are due to 1) IM pricing that was up by 3.2% in Q4 and translates to ~1.5% yearly sales at the group level, 2) acquisition, and 3) efficiencies. Related to the latest position, the company achieved €631 million in savings, exceeding the €400 million annual target. Looking at the P&amp;L results, Air Liquide's net profit increased by 6.4% and by 9.7% (excluding the negative FX impact).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720090201524806_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"669\" data-height=\"371\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720090201524806_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\" Air Liquide 2025 results\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720090201524806_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720090201524806_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720090201524806_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720090201524806_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span> Air Liquide 2025 results</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.airliquide.com/sites/airliquide.com/files/2026-02/air-liquide-pr-fy-2025-with-record-performance-and-confident-in-its-transformation-dynamic-air-liquide-confirms-its-growth-outlook.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Air Liquide Q4 results press release</a>—Fig. 2</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why are we positive?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Starting with the noteworthy update, the company maintained its 2026 outlook for a 100-basis-point increase in margins.

This was due to higher profits and lower working capital requirements. The company is also on track with its ADVANCE strategic plan, and management has proposed a DPS of €3.70 (Fig. 4), up 12% year over year. There is limited use of the buyback, so a DPS acceleration is a key positive on the company's equity story.

Looking at the 2026 management outlook, two of the three updates are met (i.e., points 2 and 3). Going to the sales evolution estimates, we are lowering the Air Liquide turnover projection to €28 billion. We include in our analysis: FX drag of 2.5% and DIG Gases' latest acquisition. The South Korean company <a href=\"https://www.chemicalprocessing.com/industrynews/news/55311795/air-liquide-acquires-dig-airgas-for-31b?utm\" rel=\"nofollow\">generated</a> €510 million in sales in 2024. Given the core operating profit outlook with a +100 basis points increase in 2026 (Fig. 3), we maintained an EBIT margin of 22% and arrived at €6.16 billion. Lowering interest expenses (€200 million) and with no change to the corporate tax rate (25%), our profits are set at €4.7 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the limited buyback, we used the <a href=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=AI:PAR\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">current share numbers</a>; our EPS is €8.1. With no change to our 25x P/E target, which is below peers', we increase our target price from €195 to €202 per share ($47.2 in ADR—this is calculated based on the fact that one ADR is equal to 1/5 of a Paris share). For US investors, AIQUF is typically a less-liquid foreign ordinary share OTC quote, not the main ADR, so we <a href=\"https://stockanalysis.com/quote/otc/AIQUY/?utm\" rel=\"nofollow\">suggest</a> investing in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AIQUY\" title=\"L'Air Liquide S.A.\">AIQUY</a>. For EU investors, Air Liquide’s primary listing trades on Euronext Paris, with an <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AI-FR?utm\" rel=\"nofollow\">average</a> daily volume of ~600k. Our valuation <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AIQUY/valuation/metrics#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">aligns</a> with Air Liquide's 5-year historical average and matches an FWD EV/EBITDA of 15.5x.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We have long covered Air Liquide, so we <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4854250-lair-liquide-solid-q3-execution-and-valuation-upside\">report</a> the following downside risks: FX headwinds, as seen in 2025; execution risks in the company's backlog; and higher CAPEX. Key risks to gas companies include lower global industrial production and regional oversupply. In our previous analysis, we reported that Air Liquide is sensitive to valuation changes due to its high P/E target.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With sales and 2027 margin visibility, a solid backlog, and lower net debt, we remain buyers. We already reported how Air Liquide is an execution growth story, and the company is already ahead of its ADVANCE strategic plan. The latest results confirmed our equity investment story. With a higher price target, Air Liquide offers a 14% potential capital upside and a 2% dividend yield.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Outside of the organic growth, acquisition contribution from the Saela deal helped push overall revenue growth with the acquisition exceeding expectations by contributing roughly $16 million in quarterly revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving down the income statement, gross margins contracted slightly by 30 bps to 51.0% due to an 80 bps headwind from higher fleet costs, but this was partially offset by improvements in insurance claims and material and supplies. SG&amp;A as a percentage of revenue increased by 50 bps as Rollins ramped up some growth initiatives. That combined led to EBITDA coming in at $194 million for the quarter at a 21.2% margin, with FY’25 EBITDA growing 10.8% to $854 million. Altogether, EPS for the quarter was $0.25, which was 2 cents above sell-side estimates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617252129_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1182\" data-height=\"390\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617252129_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Company Filings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"211\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617252129_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617252129_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617252129_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617252129_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Company Filings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With quarterly estimates falling short of expectations due to the erratic weather conditions this winter, the Winter Storm Ferm has created a tough start to the year, with more branch location closures in January 2026 than in January 2025. On the conference call, management noted that on the positive side, while the company continues to see increasing digital lead costs, it does plan to remain within their committed budget.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the balance sheet, Rollins carries minimal leverage that keeps its cost of capital very low. At a net leverage ratio of just 0.9x, well below the company’s target of 2.0x, the company maintains an investment-grade profile with a credit rating of BBB+ by Fitch and a BBB rating by S&amp;P (source: Bloomberg). With the $500 million bond issue below trading at par with a coupon of 5.25%, the company maintains an exceptionally low cost of debt just 134 bps above treasuries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617265462_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"674\" data-height=\"189\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617265462_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bloomberg\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"179\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617265462_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617265462_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617265462_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617265462_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816172767882_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1167\" data-height=\"201\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816172767882_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Company Filings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"110\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816172767882_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816172767882_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816172767882_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816172767882_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Company Filings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With low leverage, Rollins has ample free cash flow; however, it doesn’t have great reinvestment opportunities to grow organically.

As I’ll discuss later, given where the company’s valuation sits, I don’t view this to be a good use of capital since the company’s shares are expensive by any measure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816177111268_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"958\" data-height=\"719\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816177111268_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Investor Presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816177111268_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816177111268_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816177111268_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816177111268_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Investor Presentation </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the dividend, with a payout ratio of 60.5% on earnings, Rollins’ 73-cent annual dividend is good for a 1.21% yield, which is quite low.

This guidance reflects a pretty solid underlying business, where recurring revenues (excluding ancillary) actually strengthened slightly from Q3 to Q4, which suggests that momentum might carry into the new year despite some short-term weather issues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stable customer retention and low sensitivity to rollbacks both point to healthy consumer demand that hasn't fundamentally shifted. So structurally, I like the industry backdrop a lot. Pest control is driven by population density, urbanization, food safety and health regulation, and rising tolerance for pests approaching zero, which creates a fairly resilient demand pattern through cycles. Rollins sits as the number‑two global player behind Rentokil, with nearly a quarter market share in North America with strong brands that give it pricing power. The fact that over 80% of revenue now comes from recurring and ancillary services (growing north of 7% organically) reinforces my view that this is much closer to a utility‑like annuity stream than a transactional contractor business. As shown below, it’s quite difficult to find a business that has the steady growth financial profile that a company like Rollins has.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178791869_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"957\" data-height=\"719\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178791869_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Investor Presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"481\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178791869_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178791869_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178791869_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178791869_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Investor Presentation </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I view the longer-term story as likely to hinge on a few key levers: continued M&amp;A, operating modernization, and international expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the conference call post-quarter, management signaled a healthy pipeline and underwriting 2–3% annual growth from acquisitions, which seems achievable given how fragmented local pest markets remain. That said, I got the sense from their <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871687-rollins-inc-rol-presents-at-barclays-43rd-annual-industrial-select-conference-transcript\">commentary</a> at the Barclays conference last week that a more sizable deal might be more difficult to come by. For example, when asked whether the recent debt raise was “gearing up” for a transformation acquisition, Rollins talked about “getting better before getting bigger.” So it sounds as if Rollins <em>wants </em>to participate in large deals in the future, but only after internal capabilities are fully upgraded.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With sub-1x leverage, Rollins has the balance sheet to do deals without putting stress on their cap stack. At the same time, they are investing in technology (e.g., with AI‑assisted route optimization, better scheduling, standardized systems, and centralized procurement) to gradually compress unit costs and improve incremental margins, which they’ve pegged in the 25–30% range on forward revenue. If they execute, there’s margin expansion as a meaningful second leg of the equity story, not just a byproduct of scale.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks and Valuation </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I do have some reservations that temper my enthusiasm that sit mainly around valuation and execution risk. As I’ll discuss in this section, this is already a well‑owned “quality compounder” with a premium multiple. In the chart below, we can see that sell-side consensus is looking for low‑teens EPS growth off an earnings base that is not obviously depressed, and the market is effectively assuming that high‑single‑digit organic growth plus steady margin progress is the base case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816177858422_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"864\" data-height=\"480\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816177858422_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bloomberg\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"356\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816177858422_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816177858422_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816177858422_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816177858422_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In that context, disruptions (whether from weather events like in this quarter that hit one‑time work) can create noise in quarterly numbers. At some point, that might start to matter for a richly valued stock. And despite other analysts’ optimism around it, I also think international remains more of a long‑dated option rather than a material growth driver, given that international is still a single‑digit share of revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where I think the risks will come from for investors is on valuation. While Rollins has always been an expensive stock, it’s rarely been this expensive. As illustrated in the graph below, the forward EV/EBITDA valuation (not the share price) has gone up and to the right in the last three years. This was a business that was trading at sub-20x EBITDA all day long during the pandemic, but investors have unjustly bid shares much higher, now at a 10-turn premium to its historical average (source: Bloomberg).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816174100485_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"380\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816174100485_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Bloomberg\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"304\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816174100485_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816174100485_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816174100485_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816174100485_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to being expensive relative to its own historical valuation, Rollins is expensive relative to comparable companies within its industry.

For example, using the company’s P/E ratio, the business is expected to grow its earnings at a low-teens rate. If we assume an even higher figure of 15% over a five-year period, which would roughly double the company’s earnings from 2025 to the end of the decade, Rollins would still trade at a 24x earnings multiple on earnings that are half a decade away. For that reason, I find the stock. Analysts would seem to agree, given that their average target price of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROL/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">$63.66</a> implies just 5.2% upside from today’s levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178417304_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"440\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178417304_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"235\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178417304_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178417304_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178417304_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178417304_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816173487153_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"846\" data-height=\"260\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816173487153_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"197\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816173487153_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816173487153_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816173487153_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816173487153_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion </strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, Rollins is a business that I’d like to own, but it’s just too expensive today.

TRIN had total investments at fair value of $2.42 billion as of the end of its fourth quarter. This had a 9.2% exposure to SaaS, with its largest individual sector allocation to Finance and Insurance companies at 15.1% of its investments, and with Medical Devices its second largest allocation at 10%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/41871776-17720467086479616_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2498\" data-height=\"1166\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/41871776-17720467086479616_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trinity Capital Fiscal 2025 Fourth Quarter Portfolio Diversification\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"299\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/41871776-17720467086479616_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/41871776-17720467086479616_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/41871776-17720467086479616_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/41871776-17720467086479616_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Trinity Capital Fiscal 2025 Fourth Quarter Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/41871776-17720495145212562_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2510\" data-height=\"1242\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/41871776-17720495145212562_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trinity Capital Fiscal 2025 Fourth Quarter Portfolio\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"317\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/41871776-17720495145212562_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/41871776-17720495145212562_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/41871776-17720495145212562_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/41871776-17720495145212562_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Trinity Capital Fiscal 2025 Fourth Quarter Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Credit Quality, Originations Growth, and NAV Per Share</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TRIN's is also diversified across different investment types, with loans forming 77.1% of its portfolio, equipment financings at 13.9%, and high-upside equity and warrants forming a prudent 9% as of the end of the fourth quarter. This places the SaaSpocalypse dip into context, with the market fear coalescing around the potential disruption to the moats of software companies from vibe coding and a possible commodification of some enterprise SaaS. This would drive down the typically high profit margin of software companies and could drive the type of deterioration in profitability that would lead to elevated credit stress and a rise in nonaccruals for software-focused lenders.

Critically, this was down 30 basis points versus its prior quarter to signal an improvement in credit quality even as the BDC ramps up originations to counter what's been a more competitive lending market, beset by falling Fed funds rates. Total gross investment commitments came in at $543.1 million during the fourth quarter, with $434.8 million of this funded. This was set against exits and repayments of $218.8 million to continue the ramp seen in the BDC's total investment portfolio.

Stock selection within IT and Financials contributed positively to performance during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\">SSNLF</a>) (South Korea, IT sector), a consumer and industrial electronic manufacturer, including products such as semiconductors, was the top contributor during the quarter after rising memory prices amid tight supply-demand conditions for memory products supported performance. We anticipate this environment to continue into 2026, with ongoing data center expansion contributing to sustained demand for memory products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nintendo Co. Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTDOY\" title=\"Nintendo Co., Ltd.\">NTDOY</a>) (Japan, Communication Services sector), a videogame hardware and software manufacturer, was the top detractor during the period. We believe shares traded lower following a recent period of strong console launches, with additional downward pressure attributed to concerns over rising memory prices, which may affect margins, and a temporary gap in new title releases. Component supply for the company is expected to be well managed in the near term, and incremental announcements for new games are anticipated to begin as early as February, which we believe will support growth for the business moving into the new year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Fund added a position in Erste Group Bank AG (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EBKDY\" title=\"Erste Group Bank AG\">EBKDY</a>) (Austria, Financials sector), an Austrian and Central Eastern European bank, as we believe the market is underappreciating the company's outsized loan growth, improving profitability prospects, and increasing capital generation potential. The strategy also initiated a position in Rolls-Royce Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RYCEY\" title=\"Rolls-Royce Holdings plc\">RYCEY</a>) (United Kingdom, Industrials sector), one of few engine manufacturers and servicers for the commercial aerospace industry. We believe the company has strong competitive positions in power generation equipment, defense, and small modular nuclear reactors. In our view, the current management team has demonstrated success with improving engine performance on their primary aerospace platforms while the air travel market recovers, leading to higher earnings and cash flow improvement. Further, emerging tailwinds such as robust data center spending, power grid constraints, and increasing defense spending should accelerate growth in their non-aerospace segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Fund exited its position in BNP Paribas S.A. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BNPQY\" title=\"BNP Paribas SA\">BNPQY</a>) (France, Financials sector), a French bank, following a U.S. jury verdict that we believe opens the way for the company to be required to pay compensation demands which we view will be an overhang on stock performance into 2026. The Fund also exited its position in Sony Financial Group Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SFGYY\" title=\"Sony Financial Group Inc.\">SFGYY</a>) (Japan, Financials sector), after the business was spun out into a separate unit away from the consumer products and gaming company. We remain invested in the part of the business that focuses on the consumer discretionary and gaming segments.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <h4>A Word About Risk</h4> <p>The Fund invests in equities which are subject to market volatility and loss. The Fund invests in stocks of large-cap companies which may be unable to respond quickly to new competitive challenges. The Fund invests in stocks of small- and mid-cap companies, which may be subject to more erratic market movements than stocks of larger, more established companies. The Fund invests in preferred stocks which are relegated below bonds for payment should the issuer be liquidated. If interest rates rise, the fixed dividend on preferred stocks may be less attractive, causing their price to decline. The Fund invests in foreign, emerging and frontier markets securities, and depositary receipts, such as American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts, and European Depositary Receipts, which carry the associated risks of economic and political instability, market liquidity, currency volatility and accounting standards that differ from those of U.S. markets and may offer less protection to investors. The risks associated with investing in foreign markets are magnified in emerging markets, and in frontier markets due to their smaller and less developed economies. The sub-advisor considers ESG factors that it deems relevant or additive along with other material factors. The ESG criteria may cause the Fund to forgo opportunities to buy certain securities and/or gain exposure to certain industries, sectors, regions and countries. The Fund may be required to sell a security when it could be disadvantageous to do so. Events in the U.S. and global financial markets, including actions taken to stimulate or stabilize economic growth may at times result in unusually high market volatility, which could negatively impact Fund performance and cause it to experience illiquidity, shareholder redemptions, or other potentially adverse effects. Banks and financial services companies could suffer losses if interest rates rise or economic conditions deteriorate. The Advisor engages a sub-advisor to make investment decisions for the Fund's portfolio; it may be unable to identify and retain a sub-advisor who achieves superior investment returns relative to other similar sub-advisors. The Fund invests in convertible securities which are subject to the risks of both debt securities and equity securities. The Fund's investments in other investment companies will be subject to substantially the same risks as those associated with the direct ownership of the securities comprising the portfolios of such investment companies, and the value of the Fund's investment will fluctuate in response to the performance of such portfolios. In addition, if the Fund acquires shares of investment companies, shareholders of the Fund will bear their proportionate share of the fees and expenses of the Fund and, indirectly, the fees and expenses of the investment companies or ETFs. Current and future portfolio holdings are subject to change.</p> </td></tr></table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The year 2026 may see growth in wireless pricing and subsequent sales growth. BCE's focus on premium wireless and fiber clients may pay off as these high-value customers become growth partners into 2026 and beyond. We are looking at targeted pricing that is directly proportional to revenue increase, roll-out of add-ons, and higher subscription services. BCE's gross profit <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BCE/profitability\">margin</a> over the last 12 months trailing (TTM) fell 17.52% below the sector median's average of 53.52%, indicative of the company's need to grow its topline. In the same space, Verizon, while releasing its FY 2025, <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/about/sites/default/files/verizon-4Q25-earnings-press-release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">stated</a> that it was rising above the competition, supported by its premium clientele. Verizon registered 1 million net additions in 2026 in mobility and broadband, marking a significant shift in its portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then again, BCE attributed reduced market activity, such as in gross subscriber activations, that declined 9.7% (YoY) due to <a href=\"https://www.bce.ca/news-and-media/newsroom?article=bce-reports-2025-q4-and-full-year-results-announces-2026-financial-targets\" rel=\"nofollow\">immigration</a> policies by the Canadian government. The government recently <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/canada-revises-express-entry-immigration-rules-adds-military-roles-2026-02-18/\" rel=\"nofollow\">introduced</a> the immigration priority categories aimed at lowering the number of permanent residents while increasing skilled labor acquisition. Immigration pressures are seen to increase competition that forces the company to push down discounts. In Q4 2025, the average revenue from mobile phones declined 0.8% (YoY) per user to $56.72 (full-year 2025 decreased 0.9%, YoY), and BCE has had to align its focus towards premium wireless clients. For 2026, it remains to be seen if the company will grow its subscriber base, seeing that there was decreased outbound roaming revenue due to low Canada-US travel against high “Canada-US-Mexico international plans.”</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How Will BCE Navigate This Immigration Policy?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One important aspect to consider is the impact of the American pivot undertaken by BCE. So, BCE acquired Ziply Fiber for about $3.65 billion in August 2025 with the primary aim of dominating the US broadband service market. I believe that the growth of Ziply is commensurate with the cash flow and is part of the reason FCF was down 74.3% (YoY) in Q4 2025. In its recent press release, BCE stated that it had injected $260 million in capital investments tied to the “expansion of Ziply Fiber’s fiber-to-the-premise (FTTP) network.” For the 2026 forecast, BCE limited its FCF growth strategy to the range of 4% to 10%, and here the balance sheet pressure is clearly evident. It is likely that over the next 3 years (from 2026 to 2028), BCE’s annual revenue growth will rise from 2% to 4%, according to its previous guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main query here is how BCE’s profitability compares with its debt status, or is the business mix sustainable? For FY 2026, BCE is <a href=\"https://www.bce.ca/news-and-media/newsroom?page=4&amp;article=%2FBCE-outlines-strategic-plan-to-drive-sustainable-free-cash-flow-growth-and-long-term-shareholder-value\" rel=\"nofollow\">expected</a> to lower its capital intensity below 15% (the level it was back in 2025). Total CapEx in FY 2025 was C$3.7 billion, with BCE aiming to lock in a capital intensity of about 14% by 2028 to support a net debt leverage ratio of 3.0X by 2030. With the operating revenue for 2025 at C$24.47 billion and a guidance of +3% YoY (midpoint), BCE is likely to see its revenue reach about $25.20 billion by the end of FY 2025. To get the projected CapEx for FY 2026, I will multiply the forward revenue of C$25.20 billion by the capital intensity ratio of 14%, equaling C$3.53 billion, down almost 5% (YoY) from C$3.7 billion recorded in 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BCE recorded an EBITDA of C$10.66 billion in FY 2025 and is projecting a growth range of 0% to 4% (a midpoint of 2%), resulting in a guidance of $10.87 billion for FY 2026. To calculate the forward return on total capital invested, I will divide the projected EBITDA (C$10.87 billion) by the projected CapEx (C$3.53 billion), giving us a possible return of 3.08X. With the projected net debt leverage ratio at 3.0X, almost similar to a projected ROTC of 3.08X, it shows that BCE’s operating returns or profits will be sufficient to cover the company’s debt load, giving it a neutral risk profile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the dividend part, BCE is set to proceed with the 126% dividend rate cut in 2026 at a quarterly rate of $0.4375 against the earlier set rate of $0.99. I believe the company is now focusing on expanding its US profile, which may use up most of its resources. In its press <a href=\"https://www.bce.ca/news-and-media/newsroom?page=4&amp;article=%2FBCE-outlines-strategic-plan-to-drive-sustainable-free-cash-flow-growth-and-long-term-shareholder-value\" rel=\"nofollow\">release</a>, the company stated that it is working towards,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Strategic partnership with PSP Investments for the formation of Network FiberCo enables a long-term future potential fibre expansion of up to 8 million U.S. locations, increasing BCE's potential total fibre reach to up to 16+ million locations in North America.”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BCE stated that it will set aside C$5 billion from 2026 through 2028 (an annual figure of C$1.7 billion) for dividend payments to shareholders, down 135% from an annual payment of C$4 billion in 2024. At the current share price, BCE’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BCE/dividends/yield\">forward</a> dividend yield stands at 4.91% but is still 56% higher than the sector’s median of 3.12%. This dividend cut is in line with its 3-year investment <a href=\"https://www.bce.ca/news-and-media/newsroom?article=bce-reports-2025-q4-and-full-year-results-announces-2026-financial-targets\" rel=\"nofollow\">strategy,</a> and I believe we may witness an increase in the yield by 2028.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will use the enterprise value-to-EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) ratio in evaluating BCE, as it will compare the company’s market value and its profitability, including debt and cash levels. I believe this metric is appropriate for BCE, as it is capital-intensive and will provide the right picture of its cost against its power to generate cash.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BCE’s forward EV/EBITDA <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BCE/valuation/metrics\">metric</a> stands at 7.11X. To get the forward EV, I will multiply the EV/EBITDA metric (7.11) by the forward EBITDA (C$10.87 billion), giving us C$77.29 billion or about $56.35 billion. The market capitalization is calculated by subtracting the debt level ($29.914 billion) and adding the cash balance ($233.1 million), then dividing the result by the total shares outstanding, 932.5 million shares, resulting in $28.60. As of this writing, BCE’s share price was trading at $26.07, giving a difference of +9.7% (YoY). It shows that BCE is trading at its fair valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will compare the performance of BCE with some of its peers.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>Fwd.

BCE is trading at a fair valuation but may have an upside of almost 10% (YoY), trading at a forward EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.11X.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Failure to realize the expected revenue growth rate of between 2% and 4% (or higher) by the end of 2026 will negatively affect BCE’s present valuation. The company’s annual revenue growth in 2025 was 0.2% (YoY), while its adjusted EBITDA rose by 0.7% (YoY). These numbers are way below the valuation targets as seen in the analysis above.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have rated BCE Inc. as a hold in view of its modest guidance range for FY 2026, and from my analysis, which shows that it is trading at a fair valuation. My estimations show that the company has a possible upside of about 10%, and at this level, the upcycle, including higher profitability, may treat BCE better in the long run. However, I believe the projected discount may not suffice if the company's forecast revenue is not attained, as BCE is already working with very low projections, as shown in the analysis. CapEx may also be trimmed to C$3.53 billion in 2026 (according to my calculations), with the return on total capital almost at par with the net debt leverage ratio that is forecast at 3.0X, showing a sustainable business mix able to cater to the debt costs.</p>",

It has a new look today. In 2023, Fulcrum’s was evaluating losmapimod in a registrational-enabling study in Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy. I was not very<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> confident ahead of the readout given the drug’s past performance and recommended a \"</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4634235-fulcrum-therapeutics-balance-between-promise-uncertainty\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hold</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">.\". In 2024, Fulcrum announced that losmapimod </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4148936-fulcrum-stock-down-setback-gsk-partnered-drug\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">flunked</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the test and later suspended its development altogether. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, Fulcrum is heading another novel drug for another rare disease—pociredir in sickle cell. I see Fulcrum mentioned often when I am doomscrolling on social media. In my experience, sickle cell disease has always attracted retail biotechnology investors, as it exemplifies the high-risk/high-reward nature of the sector. Over the past couple of years, Fulcrum has trickled data from pociredir’s Phase 1 <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05169580?term=Pociredir&amp;rank=3\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">PIONEER</a> study. And, just recently, unveiled high dose data in 12 severe sickle cell disease patients that I believe merits a closer look.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sickle Cell Disease</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While functionally curative gene therapies are now available to patients, there is still an unmet need and plenty of room for innovation. When I come across sickle cell patients in practice, they are often admitted with a vasoocclusive pain crisis. Treatment compliance remains a <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jscd/article/2/1/yoaf038/8315152\" rel=\"nofollow\">major issue</a> as well and you can hardly blame the patients because the drugs that are available aren’t great.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hydroxyurea—the standard of care—is a prime example. In adults, the adherence rate has been cited between just 50%-60%. A contributor is likely hydroxyurea’s side effects, which can include diarrhea, bone marrow suppression, and hair loss. Despite its limitations, hydroxyurea is indispensable. Its cheap, convenient, prevents complications like stroke, and extends life expectancy. Still, there are a large subset of patients who either do not respond adequately to hydroxyurea or simply cannot tolerate it.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721104367317975_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"912\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721104367317975_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Author's Compilation\" width=\"640\" height=\"285\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721104367317975_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721104367317975_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721104367317975_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721104367317975_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Compilation</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pociredir</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like hydroxyruea, <a href=\"https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/146/Supplement%201/1157/554267/Pociredir-a-novel-oral-once-daily-fetal-hemoglobin\" rel=\"nofollow\">pociredir</a> induces expression of fetal hemoglobin (HbF). It achieves this by binding to the “embryonic ectoderm development (EED) subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), inhibiting trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), resulting in downregulation of BCL11A and MYB.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in February 2023, pociredir was hit with a full <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1680581/000095017023006834/fulc-ex99_1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">clinical hold</a>. According to Fulcrum,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>The Agency noted preclinical data previously submitted in April, October and December 2022, and non-clinical and clinical evidence of hematological malignancies observed with other inhibitors of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2).</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The clinical hold was quickly resolved after Fulcrum defined the “population where the potential benefit of continued treatment with FTX-6058 outweighs potential risk.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I bring this up not because a risk for malignancy is unusual in biopharma (e.g., hydroxyurea, itself, includes a <a href=\"https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/016295s054lbl.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">label warning</a> for malignancy development), but because pociredir lives in this shadow. In other words, its risk profile is such that it merits testing only in severe, treatment-refractory cases. PIONEER was designed with this in mind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last December, Fulcrum <a href=\"https://www.fulcrumtx.com/wp-content/uploads/251206-PIONEER-PHASE-1B-ASH-POSTER-vF.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">presented</a> interim data from the high-dose cohort.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721104367898607.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FULC\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Fulcrum</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So roughly half of the patients on 20mg reached the ≥20% threshold that is often regarded as “clinically significant.” But, follow-up was limited to 42 days in Cohort 4. So it was reasonable to believe that—with more time—patients could exceed a total HbF of ≥20%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fast forward to earlier this week, Fulcrum announced 12-week results from Cohort 4 (see <a href=\"https://ir.fulcrumtx.com/static-files/ad8b1e95-b4be-4100-9815-4a90e0b93327\" rel=\"nofollow\">deck</a>).</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721104367162468.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FULC\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Fulcrum</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The mean absolute HbF level of 19.3% fell just a bit short of the 20% threshold. That said, 7/12 patients did reach this goal. The immediate market reaction to this release was negative, as many may have hoped that the mean HbF would cross 20%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another thing that sticks out to me when reviewing the slides is that there doesn’t appear to be much difference in efficacy between the 12mg and 20mg cohorts. Of course, this is just me glancing at the slides, but when you look over Slides 15-18—which cover hemolysis markers, blood cell morphology, and hemoglobin, the lines often intersect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following the release, Fulcrum stated they intend to soon initiate an <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT07401823?term=Pociredir&amp;rank=2\" rel=\"nofollow\">open-label extension study</a> to the PIONEER study and have a word with the FDA regarding pociredir’s path forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874115-fulcrum-therapeutics-inc-fulc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">call</a>, management expressed hope that HbF could serve as a surrogate for accelerated approval—which would really lift the drug’s probability of success.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>Based on the strength and the consistency of the data that we've generated to date, with the robust induction of HbF and this progression towards a broader pancellular distribution along with the improvements of biomarkers of hemolysis and anemia, we really think that it's appropriate to advance into a study with the potential to be registration enabling. And that will certainly be a topic for our discussion with the FDA at the end of Phase meeting. Of course, there is substantial published literature that demonstrates an association between higher HbF levels and improved clinical outcomes in sickle cell disease. And that biological relationship is obviously a key part of the underlying rationale for our program.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As someone who has covered sickle cell plenty of times in the past, I can confirm that there is precedent for accelerated approval based on a biomarker endpoint. Pfizer’s OXBYRTA immediately comes to mind. This one was approved based on its effect on hemoglobin. Of course, Pfizer would later voluntarily <a href=\"https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-voluntarily-withdraws-all-lots-sickle-cell-disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">remove</a> OXBYRTA from the market after it became obvious that it can increase vasoocclusive crises.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps with this in mind—and the FDA’s everchanging stance depending on the day and its leader—Fulcrum was also careful to hedge this hope.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>And of course, whether HbF could play a role in an accelerated approval framework will ultimately be a regulatory determination, but we very much look forward to discussing the totality of the PIONEER data set with the FDA in order to understand their perspective on the appropriate path forward.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While very early, PIONEER data has been encouraging so far when it comes to more robust clinical endpoints like vasoocclusive crises (e.g., reductions in bilirubin, increases in hemoglobin). But as we witnessed with OXBRTA, improvements in hemolysis markers do not always translate to vasoocclusive crisis reduction.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pharma DCF Model</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, pociredir seems best positioned as a treatment option in severe sickle cell disease patients who—for one reason or another—cannot take HU. While the CDC cites ~100,000 sickle cell disease patients in the US, maybe 1 in 5 can be classified as “severe.” And about half of severe patients do not respond or cannot tolerate HU. Although its label may be inclusive of the entire sickle cell disease population, this subpopulation is pociredir’s actual TAM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I modeled for 33% peak share. This doesn’t sound like much, but it is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A probability of success of 26.3% is based on historical data for Phase 2-ready hematology drugs.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704449890115_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1336\" data-height=\"2048\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704449890115_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Author's Compilation\" width=\"640\" height=\"981\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704449890115_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704449890115_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704449890115_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704449890115_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Compilation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that Fulcrum’s remaining assets are in “discovery,” its valuation is overwhelmingly tied to pociredir in this one indication.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704448138947_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"685\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704448138947_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Author's Compilation\" width=\"640\" height=\"214\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704448138947_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704448138947_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704448138947_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48050289-17720704448138947_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Compilation</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Words</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FULC looks aggressively priced, but not ridiculously so. With $352.3 million in cash and investments, Fulcrum is in a good spot to get pociredir to the finish line. And it would not surprise me to see investor excitement should pociredir be hastened to the market (e.g., if Fulcrum announces it needs just one pivotal trial to serve as the basis for approval and that HbF could serve as the primary endpoint).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I can see the utility of FULC within a biotech-focused barbell portfolio, I don’t think the potential upside for pociredir (if everything goes perfect), given its actual TAM in sickle cell disease, justifies the risk. So I'm sticking with a \"Hold\" rating on FULC. </p>",

What is more, lower Fed interest rates should put further pressure on the U.S. dollar, providing a tailwind for non-U.S. issuers, as it will make servicing dollar-denominated debt easier.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A potential beneficiary of these developments may be the <strong>Invesco Global ex-US High Yield Corporate Bond ETF</strong> (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PGHY\" title=\"Invesco Global ex-US High Yield Corporate Bond ETF\">PGHY</a></span>). Indeed, PGHY invests exclusively in USD-denominated debt issued by corporates operating in countries outside the United States. I rank PGHY a Buy, as I believe it is an attractive income option for investors comfortable with some credit risk and potential drawdowns during economic downturns/financial market turmoil. My bullish outlook is underpinned by:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>A 6.50-7.00% total return outlook after accounting for the ETF's 0.35% expense ratio.</li> <li>A macroeconomic environment characterized by positive GDP growth in countries where PGHY invests, notwithstanding near-term pockets of weakness in 2026.</li> <li>Expectations for further U.S. dollar weakness in 2026-2027, allowing for easier servicing of USD debt by issuers operating in local currencies such as the Canadian dollar and Brazilian real.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio characteristics and credit risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.invesco.com/us/en/financial-products/etfs/invesco-global-ex-us-high-yield-corporate-bond-etf.html\" rel=\"noopener\">PGHY's portfolio currently offers a yield to maturity of 7.2%</a>, achieved with an average maturity of 5.18 years. For comparison, risk-free 5-year U.S. treasuries (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US5Y\" class=\"ticker-link\">US5Y</a>) currently offer a yield of about 3.62%, indicating that PGHY's portfolio trades at a spread of about 3.6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is somewhat justified as only 11.6% of the portfolio is rated investment-grade (credit rating of BBB), followed by a sizable 60.33% allocation to the first tier of the speculative/high-yield section of the bond market, namely issuers rated BB. Issuers with an eleven lower single B credit rating account for 24.05% of the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, we see that the extra 3.6% in yield offered by PGHY comes with a circa 88% allocation to non-investment grade securities, indicating an elevated probability of losses during economic downturns. The chance of loss is further highlighted when we look at PGHY's sector allocation, with roughly 75% of the portfolio invested in issuers operating in cyclical sectors such as industrials and financials.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As an investor in fixed-income instruments, you only get a fixed return when business is booming for cyclical companies, thus missing out on the upside. However, when things go sour, the risk of losses becomes apparent, as non-investment-grade credit ratings suggest limited scope to absorb adverse operating conditions for a prolonged period of time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Country allocation and macro outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While individual issuer credit risk largely stems from the company's capital structure and the prospects for the sector it is operating in, macroeconomic conditions can also impact company performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, examining the GDP growth outlook for countries where PGHY invests is helpful when we want to assess the probability of near-term losses associated with issuers experiencing difficulties making payments in full.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PGHY's largest country allocation is to Brazil (11.9% of the portfolio), followed by Canada at 10.90%. No other single country accounts for more than 7.5% of the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/countries/bra\" rel=\"noopener\">IMF projects Brazil's economy to expand at 1.6% in 2026</a>, a slowdown from the circa 2.5% growth in 2025, with <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/-/media/files/publications/weo/2026/january/english/text.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">an acceleration to 2.3% expected in 2027</a>. Canadian GDP growth dynamics should prove more resilient, with the IMF projecting 2026 GDP growth of 1.6%, in line with 2025, followed by acceleration to 1.9% in 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, notwithstanding the possibility for some near-term weakness in countries such as Brazil, from a macro standpoint, I see no immediate risk for a deterioration of credit quality. I should mention, however, that Mexico accounts for 3.85% of the portfolio, which <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20408255-mexican-army-kills-leader-of-powerful-jalisco-new-generation-cartel-during-operation-to\">could be a drag on returns if violence following the killing of El Mencho</a>, leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, continues.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rating and return potential</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In light of the outlook for somewhat lower USD rates, some loan prepayments to take advantage of refinancing possibilities cannot be ruled out. As such, a conservative approach would be to use PGHY's yield to worst (a metric assuming issuers take advantage of bond call options) of 6.88%. Coupled with the ETF's expense ratio of 0.35%, a return of around 6.5% is the baseline outlook investors can reasonably expect when investing in PGHY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">You will immediately notice that this is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PGHY/dividends/scorecard\">somewhat below the 7.12% dividend yield offered by PGHY</a>. Indeed the ETF has already cut dividends by 3.25% over the past year, reflecting prior Fed rate cuts. I expect this trend to continue in 2026 and 2027 as issuers take advantage of lower rates to refinance debt obligations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I should also mention the potential of capital gains on top of the attractive current income. Taking account of the 3.19 effective duration and my expectations for an incremental 0.1-0.15% decline in five-year risk-free interest rates, I would put the capital gain potential at below 0.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To conclude, I estimate PGHY should deliver a total return of about 6.5-7.00% over the next 12 months, making it an attractive income option for investors comfortable with credit risk and foreign market exposure. With these caveats in mind, I rate PGHY a Buy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Under baseline economic assumptions, I am quite comfortable with my 6.5-7.00% return outlook for PGHY. During periods of financial market turmoil and economic stress, however, PGHY will likely significantly underperform risk-free 5-year U.S. treasuries. This is exactly what happened in the first three months of 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, when PGHY lost roughly 13% of its value even as 5-year treasury yields declined by roughly 1.2% (from 1.59% at the end of 2019 to about 0.42% in March 2020).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, when investing in PGHY, you should be comfortable with the current 3.6% yield premium (relative to 5-year treasuries) expanding quite significantly during adverse market conditions, thus leading to near-term capital losses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other key risk to mention would be a reversal of recent U.S. dollar weakness. This may put pressure on corporate earnings for issuers operating in local currencies such as the Brazilian real or Canadian dollar, but having to pay interest and principal in U.S. dollars. As things stand, my baseline outlook remains for a somewhat weaker USD in 2026-2027, impacted by anticipated future Fed rate cuts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After slashing rates by 0.75% in late 2025, the Fed appears to be on pause, with markets pricing in the next 0.25% cut for July 2026. This should prove to be a tailwind for bond ETFs such as PGHY, which invest in securities issued by corporates outside the United States.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My baseline outlook is for PGHY to deliver a total return of 6.50-7.00% over the next year, making it an attractive income option for investors comfortable with bearing credit risk, which may principally materialize during periods of economic weakness and financial market turmoil.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A reversal of recent USD weakness may also weigh on PGHY as its issuers operating in non-USD currencies will find it harder to service debt issued in USD.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thank you for reading.</p>",

In the BNPL sector, we have ''Prime'' players like Affirm (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AFRM\" title=\"Affirm Holdings, Inc.\">AFRM</a>) and Klarna (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KLAR\" title=\"Klarna Group plc\">KLAR</a>), and the players in the ''Subprime'' vertical that serve<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the unbanked. Sezzle fits into this category. In this article, I will explore their business model, the successful pivot to subscription based revenue, and the trajectory of their credit losses. So far, I have watched Sezzle from the sidelines due to my concerns over rising credit losses as a percentage of GMV. But in the Q4 released February 25, 2026, we saw a significant YoY decline in provisions for credit losses, and consequently a rise in the stock price in the after hours trading. This data de-risks investing in the company, and therefore, I am initiating a Buy rating. In my opinion, this remains a high-risk, high-reward play due to the undeniable high growth, but subprime lending sector risk remains, although it seems management is successfully mitigating it.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business Model</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For those unfamiliar with Sezzle, they are a Buy-now-Pay-later provider that is specifically targeting the customer with the lowest credit score, who is unable to access traditional credit cards. The company’s primary differentiator is the Sezzle Up credit-building platform. This allows the user to slowly build up their credit score while using the platform, since Sezzle reports to all three major bureaus - TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Users link their bank accounts via Plaid and agree to credit reporting, which allows Sezzle visibility into a user's bank balance and their income streams. This direct access to cash-flow data allows Sezzle to better estimate a user’s ability to repay, allowing them to filter out liabilities before they default.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that this feature creates high retention rates. A user that is actively building their credit score from, say, 500 to 600 using Sezzle is less likely to churn than, for example, a user that is using BNPL simply for a one-off purchase. Yet this creates a risk that once a user builds a sufficient credit score needed to get approved for a credit card, they are likely to churn simply because Sezzle is just too expensive compared to the $0 monthly fees of prime credit products. Note that Sezzle charges <a href=\"https://legal.sezzle.com/fees/en-us\" rel=\"nofollow\">$19.99 per month</a> for the Sezzle Anywhere service. As the name says, the subscription plan allows the subscriber to use Sezzle anywhere, not only at direct partnered merchants.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other option is Sezzle Premium which costs between <a href=\"https://legal.sezzle.com/fees/en-us\" rel=\"nofollow\">$13.99</a> per month, depending on the tier, but has fewer merchants available. More details can be found on their website. In my opinion, a user trying to build a credit score needs to be able to use BNPL anywhere, and most importantly at major retailers like Walmart or Target, because that is where, I believe, the low-income subscribers spend the majority of their money. This subscription thesis was, in my opinion, validated in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20414069-sezzle-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025-results#source=section%3Aearnings_summary%7Csection_asset%3Aearnings_history%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3Apress-release\">Q4 earnings release</a>, as Monthly On-Demand &amp; Subscribers reached 918,000, with 134,000 new users being added in Q4. Such users will continue to provide predictable and stable revenue, as long as the company continues to keep provisions for credit losses low.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI Underwriting</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the Q3 2025 earnings call, CEO Charlie Youakim highlighted the use of AI as a tool for risk assessment and operational leverage. I believe this is an excellent choice; first, because of analyzing cash transactions in real time, which Sezzle has access to due to the Sezzle Up. As their AI gets better, the provisions for credit losses might go down as a percentage of GMV. Second is that Sezzle is growing fast. In Q3, Sezzle grew their revenues by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SEZL/income-statement\">approx. 66%</a> YoY. Normally, that would require hiring additional staff, but the CEO noted that its AI will likely allow them to keep the support team at the same size or that it could even shrink. In Q4 company reported that: ''Total Operating Expenses grew 10.8% YoY to $74.6 million, well below revenue growth of 32.2%.'' I regard this margin expansion as evidence that the AI strategy is working, and operating expenses as part of revenue should continue to decrease.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Provisions for Credit Losses</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One thing that worried me prior to initiating coverage were the rising provisions for credit losses as a % of GMV, as is evident from the Table 1. Until Q4 such losses kept increasing both YoY and QoQ, which was the main reason I avoided the company. Below is the table showing provisions for credit losses data for the last 8 quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/6455341-17721029402480273_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"847\" data-height=\"411\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/6455341-17721029402480273_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Provisions for credit losses\" width=\"640\" height=\"311\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/6455341-17721029402480273_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/6455341-17721029402480273_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/6455341-17721029402480273_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/6455341-17721029402480273_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Table 1 <span>(Author's work)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q4, we can clearly see a reversal of the metric that worried me most. Provisions for credit losses declined by 80 basis points to 2% of GMV. Management stated that this is due to ''Favorable repayment performance and conservative holiday season underwriting.'' I view this as a sign that management successfully tightened underwriting standards while maintaining high growth, which is the reason I turned bullish.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The improvement in this metric also impacted the bottom line, with adjusted EBITDA increasing 79.1% YoY to $58.3 million, and net income reaching $42.7 million, advancing 68.3% YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An investor must continue to watch this metric closely. Management guided for provisions for credit losses to stay between 2.5% and 3% in FY2026. Note that this is still higher than in FY2025, as according to my calculations, they were at 2.27%, which is the main reason I am issuing a ''Bullish'' and not a ''Very Bullish'' rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management guided FY2026 adjusted EPS to be $4.70 with revenue growth between 25% and 30%. At the current price of $72, the forward (adjusted) PE ratio would be approx. 15x. For a company with a projected growth of 27.5% at the midpoint, this is cheap, especially considering stable SaaS revenue. I believe the main reason that it is trading at this price is the past increase in the provisions for credit losses metric. Peers like Enova International (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENVA\" title=\"Enova International, Inc.\">ENVA</a>) and Credit Acceptance (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CACC\" title=\"Credit Acceptance Corporation\">CACC</a>) are both trading at a 13x PE multiple. Both Enova and Credit Acceptance are in the subprime lending business, but are growing much more slowly. Affirm (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AFRM\" title=\"Affirm Holdings, Inc.\">AFRM</a>) is trading at a GAAP 61x PE multiple (although the forward PE multiple is around 29x).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see two scenarios that can happen here; the first is that management executes well and keeps credit losses between 2.5% and 3%. In such a case, we should see the PE multiple expand. For a company with a SaaS revenue model, although exposed to subprime lending, growing at 27.5%, I believe a fair PE multiple should be between 20 and 25x. This represents significant upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, if we see weakness in the economy, it is possible that provisions for credit losses to deteriorate. In such a case, I believe that the stock will decline to reach a valuation similar to the slow-growing subprime lenders like Enova and Credit Acceptance, which I mentioned earlier.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plan</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 earnings results significantly de-risked investing in the company. I am issuing a ''Buy'' rating, and I plan to open an initial position. I will also closely monitor provisions for credit losses in Q1 2026 and potential changes in guidance for FY2026.</p>",
