However, I was bullish because its Falcon product was not to blame, and also due to the trust factor, arguing that customers were unlikely to switch to the competition just because of one glitch in the company’s long track record.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For this thesis, I employ the same trust argument, this time to alleviate AI disruption fears, implying it warrants a rerating. For this purpose, looking through the lenses of relationship psychology, I first use Rusbult’s \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_model_of_commitment\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Investment Model of Commitment</a>\" to show that investors are likely to remain committed to the cybersecurity provider after Anthropic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>) recently unveiled a new AI feature called Claude Code Security.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Relationship Psychology Shows Customers Are Likely to Remain Committed to CrowdStrike</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a social psychologist, Caryl Rusbult conceived her commitment model to explain why people stay in relationships for years, even when it appears to others (the family or society) that it is not worth staying together. In this particular context, “investment” means the time and effort (including financial) that each person has committed to their relationship.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Making a parallel with cybersecurity, corporations that choose CrowdStrike not only invest capital to purchase its endpoint security but also train their support teams (engineers and technicians) on the associated products, highlighting a partnership relationship rather than a buyer-seller approach.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to investment, Rusbult also emphasizes satisfaction (how good the relationship feels) and alternatives (like the implications of getting separated). In other words, if someone has made a big investment in a relationship and is satisfied while not having valid alternatives, she will continue to be committed (to her partner), even if there are intermittent problems (quarrels).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the same way, even when the glitch impacted 8.5 million devices due to a malfunction in CrowdStrike's security updates in 2024, the company continues to remain <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\">trusted</a>, as shown below, because customers obtain satisfaction from its Falcon platform to safeguard their data and comply with the strictest regulations, especially when facing AI-driven <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">cyberattacks</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720005541649184_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1463\" data-height=\"645\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720005541649184_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"s\" width=\"640\" height=\"282\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720005541649184_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720005541649184_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720005541649184_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720005541649184_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>www.crowdstrike.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In consequence, CrowdStrike did not face an erosion of its customer base, but, on the contrary, its total sales progressed from <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD/income-statement\">$3.05 billion</a> in fiscal year 2024 (FY-24 ending in January 2024) to $3.95 billion in FY 2025. Also, revenues of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD/earnings/estimates\">$4.80 billion</a> are expected for FY-26, which would represent a 21.5% YoY increase if achieved.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Instead of Being Disrupted, CrowdStrike Has Rapidly Integrated GenAI</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using the same logic, that is, a trust relationship is not easily broken, even if a new competitor comes up with a much cheaper endpoint protection tool as a result of employing AI agents (virtual software entities that work on behalf of a human developer) instead of human developers, it is unlikely for enterprises with critical data valued at billions of dollars to entrust them with their IT security needs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is especially so since, to reduce the chances of it being disrupted, CrowdStrike has rapidly integrated Gen AI in its product line, namely with <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/charlotte-ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charlotte AI,</a> as shown below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/49663886-17717389438881798_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"709\" data-height=\"358\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/49663886-17717389438881798_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"s\" width=\"640\" height=\"323\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/49663886-17717389438881798_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/49663886-17717389438881798_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/49663886-17717389438881798_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/49663886-17717389438881798_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>www.crowdstrike.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The approach here consists of assisting users, such as security analysts working in SOCs (Security Operations Centers), in identifying potential threats before they translate into issues. For investors, large enterprises rely on these centers, which are manned by security analysts on a 24/7 basis and which act as the first line of defense against viruses and cyberattacks. The problem is that this includes tedious and resource-intensive tasks that consume significant man-hours, given the sheer number of alerts. To address this issue, CrowdStrike automates or partially automates (depending on the corporate goals) through AI agents deployed through the Falcon <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Agentic</a> Security Platform, an augmented version of its Falcon product.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The aim is to make the SOCs more autonomous, an approach essential to avoid staff manning them drowning in alerts as these rise <a href=\"https://www.vikingcloud.com/blog/cybersecurity-statistics#:~:text=The%20Outlook%20on%20Cyberattacks%20is,%E2%80%A2\" rel=\"nofollow\">exponentially</a>. Moreover, with the Charlotte AI platform, another innovation consists of the alert database being queried in natural language (plain English) instead of complex jargon understandable only by highly trained professionals. With such an approach, junior analysts can do the job, thus economizing support dollars for CrowdStrike's customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, against the daunting backdrop consisting of the <a href=\"https://onlineprograms.ecu.edu/blog/ai-cyber-attacks/#:~:text=The%20advancement%20and%20increasing%20accessibility,2023%2C%20according%20to%20a%20report\" rel=\"nofollow\">astronomical</a> rise of AI-driven attacks, whereas the hacker enhances his capabilities using AI agents, CrowdStrike has not stayed idle. It has rapidly embedded innovation in its cybersecurity portfolio. However, in sharp contrast, the stock has suffered and lost around <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD\">8%</a> on February 20 after the Anthropic announcement, hinting that investors are overlooking how the cybersecurity provider has augmented its products using AI and the trust factor. This is why I believe the stock deserves better.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuing CrowdStrike Based on the Trust Factor and Competitive Positioning</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, to quantify \"human trust\" in a stock like CrowdStrike involves assessing how customer loyalty fared in the period following the major outage. Now, in addition to revenue growth mentioned earlier, its fiscal third quarter 2025 (which ended in October 2024) gross retention rate, or the percentage of recurring revenue retained from existing customers, of over <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740521-crowdstrike-holdings-inc-crwd-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">97%,</a> shows resiliency three months after the outage, due to customers sticking to Falcon. Also, net retention rate, which measures whether customers have purchased more from the company, was <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740521-crowdstrike-holdings-inc-crwd-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">115%</a>, showing a strengthened commitment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next step is to assess how brand perception has evolved as AI has taken center stage over the last two years. In this case, its Net Promoter Score of <a href=\"https://www.comparably.com/brands/crowdstrike\" rel=\"nofollow\">42</a> (on a scale of -100 to 100) indicates that its reputation remains positive, with 63% promoters (satisfied users) and 21% detractors (dissatisfied users).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, loyalty and a strong brand both support product adoption and sales, but only if the technology has kept up amid the competition. In this connection, as shown <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\">below</a>, the company has been named a <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/crowdstrike-leader-2025-idc-marketscape-exposure-management/#:~:text=AI%20agents%20and%20automated%20remediation,addresses%20risk%20in%20real%20time.\" rel=\"nofollow\">leader</a> in IDC MarketScape for Exposure Management in August 2025, ahead of Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), which has been categorized as a major player. Additionally, the cybersecurity pure play was named as a leader in managed (threat) detection and response by <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/crowdstrike-named-leader-forrester-wave-managed-detection-response-services-europe-q3-2025/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forrester</a> last year, after being named as a leader for endpoint protection alongside some other big names by <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/why-crowdstrike/crowdstrike-industry-validation/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gartner</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49663886-17720922492986019_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1226\" data-height=\"698\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49663886-17720922492986019_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"s\" width=\"640\" height=\"364\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49663886-17720922492986019_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49663886-17720922492986019_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49663886-17720922492986019_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49663886-17720922492986019_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>www.crowdstrike.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notably, specifically related to cost, its endpoint security was stated to deliver <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/press-releases/crowdstrike-endpoint-security-delivers-high-roi-forrester-study/\" rel=\"nofollow\">273%</a> ROI over three years with a payback period of under six months, which, according to me, sets up a very high bar that emerging players have to beat. Thus, in view of the strength of its brand, ability to maintain customer loyalty, its competitive positioning, and its undervaluation (trading at a trailing P/S of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD/valuation/metrics\">21x</a>, which is around 23% below its five-year average), it appears to have been punished too hard.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, applying a premium of 23% to its current share price of $350, I have a target of $430 (350 x 1.23). This still represents a moderate position given its above 40% slide since November last year, but there are risks mainly related to AI startups.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <span>There Are Risks, But Paradoxically, AI Implies More Business for</span> <span>CrowdStrike</span> </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What’s great about the recently launched Anthropic's security feature, Claude <a href=\"https://snyk.io/articles/anthropic-launches-claude-code-security/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Code</a> Security, is that it automatically scans code for security weaknesses, even suggesting fixes. Its launch on February 20 spelled havoc for cybersecurity stocks, with CrowdStrike sliding by around <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD\">8%</a>, which is considerable. There could be other similar episodes triggered by AI-led innovation, given that cybersecurity startups have garnered more than<a href=\"https://softwarestrategiesblog.com/2025/10/28/top-ten-cybersecurity-startups-2025-investor-funding/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> $3 billion</a> in venture capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, in addition to AI bubble fears, which were amplified since November last year (introductory chart), the stock has also been volatile because of “SaaS is <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/blogs/saas-as-we-know-it-is-dead-how-to-survive-the-saas-pocalypse/\" rel=\"nofollow\">dead</a>” fears. This centers around the emergence of new competitors (disruptors) offering cheaper products as a result of carrying out software development using AI agents instead of the human programmers employed by incumbents.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I believe these fears are largely unjustified for the following reasons.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, while Claude Security has potential, it is currently available in limited research preview mode, meaning for testing and refinement for production environments through a select group of users, not for general, unrestricted commercial use. Second, the fact that it can spot serious new vulnerabilities can also potentially be used by attackers to augment their attacks, something known as the <a href=\"https://www.trendingtopics.eu/anthropic-claude-code-security-flash-crash-stocks/\" rel=\"nofollow\">dual-use</a> aspect of technology, or be used for good or bad. One example is hackers using Anthropic AI to commit <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr24eqnnq9o\" rel=\"nofollow\">theft.</a> Thus, organizations have to be very careful when using Claude Security.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the company is not immune to volatility related to the AI bubble bursting or a new startup developing a revolutionary IT protection solution, I believe that paradoxically, its business could benefit from AI, potentially amplifying the number of cyberattacks. In this connection, when talking about AI agents during the most recent earnings call, CrowdStrike's CEO emphasized their \"rapidly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4527899-crowdstrike-outlines-23-percent-arr-growth-target-for-fy26-as-ai-driven-demand-accelerates\">expanding</a> risk profile\" and how these represented a \"major driver for the business\". This implies more sales and supports the bullish position, as cybersecurity annual spending is expected to exceed <a href=\"https://cybersecurityventures.com/official-2026-cybersecurity-market-report-predictions-and-statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">$500 billion</a> as of this year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the Age of AI Agents, Human-Based Trust and CrowdStrike Integrated Platform Are Essential</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In conclusion, this thesis has shown the importance of human-based trust, a key element that, according to me, is being overlooked as investors' focus on AI’s prowess during product demos, not what they are actually capable of in a corporate setup. In the same vein, AI startups cannot replicate CrowdStrike's highly integrated Falcon platform, which combines endpoint, identity protection, data protection, threat intelligence, etc., as shown <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\">below</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720462947305083_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1256\" data-height=\"455\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720462947305083_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"s\" width=\"640\" height=\"232\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720462947305083_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720462947305083_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720462947305083_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720462947305083_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>www.crowdstrike.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of that, CrowdStrike's technology is deeply integrated within customers' security operations and corporate process flows (established procedures) in a trustworthy manner for years. This all means that there are high switching costs for those thinking of dumping CrowdStrike products.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last, as the IT security landscape becomes more perilous, it is unlikely for companies to entrust the protection of their critical infrastructure to AI startups using agents. The reason is that one of the good agents may go rogue (possibly as a result of being hacked by a bad actor), leading to a breach, just like in the movie <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_%282007_film%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Breach</a> (2007), where Robert Hanssen, an FBI agent, leaked top-secret information to the Soviet Union and betrayed his country. In these conditions, organizations are more likely to continue trusting CrowdStrike's cybersecurity approach, where human capabilities are augmented by AI, instead of an AI-driven competitor with no track record.</p>",

The company reported fiscal Q4 revenue<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> of $68.1 billion, up 73% y/y and exceeding the </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">average</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> consensus estimate of about $66.2 billion. This supported a better-than-expected fiscal Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.62, up 82% y/y and exceeding the average consensus estimate of about $1.54.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More importantly, data center sales remain in the spotlight. The segment grew fiscal Q4 revenue by 75% y/y towards $62.3 billion, besting the average consensus estimate of $60.4 billion by more than 3%. Robust demand signals have also increased management’s confidence that Nvidia is well-positioned to exceed the $500 billion revenue opportunity previously predicted for the current Blackwell roadmap and next-generation Rubin products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A key standout during the latest earnings update was management’s increased emphasis on scaling and optimizing “tokenomics,” diversifying from its historical focus on its best-selling GPUs. The commentary specifically alludes to intensifying power and memory constraints that have bottlenecked new data center infrastructure deployments required for scaling AI advancements. This includes the recent inflection observed in “frontier agentic systems” like Anthropic’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>) <a href=\"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">Claude Code</a> and <a href=\"https://openclaw.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenClaw</a>, which is expected to accelerate token demand. Yet because of the fixed power budget in data center deployments, increasing tokens per watt has become a key function of revenue and ROI optimization for both Nvidia and its customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This shift in AI compute dynamics is expected to reinforce long-term demand for Nvidia’s platform. Specifically, management has disclosed that Nvidia-based data centers currently “generate the highest revenues.” And this assertion likely implies superior unit economics as well, given management’s claims that Nvidia products currently deliver industry’s “lowest cost per token” as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, it’s evident that Nvidia’s impending upside will not just be driven by industry demand for high-performance GPUs, but also turnkey, rack-scale compute infrastructure that can help overcome inevitable bottlenecks – like power constraints. This will be essential for optimizing tokens per watt and, ultimately, AI revenue and investment returns. And Nvidia remains well-positioned to address this demand dynamic, anchored by its expanding leadership in networking for scaling AI factories, its advancing CPU roadmap focused on post-training workflows, and its CUDA software stack. This remains a competitive combination for unlocking incremental tokenomic gains critical in next-generation AI infrastructure deployments, underscoring sustained growth and valuation upside for Nvidia from current levels.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Tokenomics Explained</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tokenomics and tokens per watt were repeated themes in Nvidia’s latest earnings update.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Accelerating compute demand from generative AI and model training, now increasingly reinforced by an agentic inflection as observed in recent momentum behind Claude Code, is raising utilization across the infrastructure stack. Yet power availability – a key prerequisite for AI compute – remains a binding constraint. This dynamic has been unanimously echoed by hyperscalers in recent earnings calls, as power constraints emerge as a key bottleneck to converting end-market demand into realizable growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The dynamic has accordingly increased demand for tokens per watt optimization – or facilitating more model work out of each unit of fixed power capacity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tokens essentially refer to the units of work a model processes. For instance, when a query is submitted on ChatGPT, the prompt is broken into a “token stream” ingested by the model behind the platform. This is then transformed using compute into an output token stream that becomes the generated response. The increasing use of generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT, alongside the rapid adoption of AI agents like Claude Code and OpenClaw, is expected to accelerate the rate of token generation growth, further bringing the power bottleneck to light.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, increasing tokens per watt or performance per watt has become a critical consideration in AI unit economics. This is because tokens are the primary monetizable output that justifies AI investment spend. Because power availability is an inherent limiting factor within a data center, the ability to process more tokens per watt will essentially translate to higher revenue generated per watt. Not only so, but higher tokens per watt also effectively reduce operating costs, resulting in margin expansion and, inevitably, enhanced AI infrastructure investment returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Scaling compute-intensive AI data center builds has also become a key lever in optimizing tokens per watt. This includes “scaling up” – increasing compute density by packing more GPUs and memory bandwidth within a single server – and “scaling out” – expanding total cluster compute by enabling efficient cross-server and cross-datacenter GPU communication.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, networking is becoming increasingly mission-critical in scaling new AI infrastructure builds. Networking is essentially one of the key determinants of whether GPUs can communicate effectively and efficiently at low latency as AI clusters scale out. It also ensures optimized uptime across the infrastructure to ensure expensive GPU capacity is being fully utilized and not idled. Any networking shortfall could translate into lower utilization, higher cost per token, and weaker ROI on compute spend. (I’ve done a deep dive on scaling AI clusters and the role of networking solutions in a recent coverage <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4873570-applied-optoelectronics-the-ai-networking-dark-horse-wall-street-underestimates\">here</a> if you’re interested.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, Nvidia continues to lead across three mission-critical components, in addition to GPUs, that have become increasingly central pillars to scaling compute and improving token spend efficiency: 1) networking, 2) CUDA, and 3) CPUs. As power, space, and “AI fabric” (or AI data center networking) performance become binding constraints, these capabilities could represent additional catalysts for data center growth alongside GPU accelerator sales. It also positions Nvidia to expand its share of AI infrastructure budgets beyond GPU capex and into the broader rack-scale buildout required to convert compute into tokens and monetizable AI returns.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>1. Networking</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia’s networking revenues are primarily generated from NVLink – its scale-up solution – as well as Spectrum-X Ethernet and InfiniBand – its scale-out solutions.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>NVLink</em></strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-nvidia-nvlink/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NVLink</a> is Nvidia’s proprietary scale-up networking technology used as a “high-speed interconnect for GPU and CPU processors in accelerated systems.” Today, the technology has evolved to its fourth generation, enabling up to 18 links per GPU and aggregate bandwidth – or communication speed – at up to 900GB/s. This has accelerated the number of processors that can \"send and receive data from a shared pool of memory at lightning speed,\" enabling a competitive scale-up advantage for Nvidia’s systems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVLink 72 is currently Nvidia’s best-selling networking product, which was first launched in 2024 with the Blackwell-based <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb200-nvl72/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GB200 NVL72</a> system. Specifically, Blackwell-based GB200 and GB300 are not just GPUs but instead a coherent compute system. The GB200 NVL72 consists of 36 Grace CPUs and 72 Blackwell GPUs under an “<a href=\"https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/vera-rubin-extreme-co-design-an-evolution\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oberon rack</a>” structure, with NVLink being the critical scale-up networking solution that connects each Grace CPU with two Blackwell GPUs. Blackwell Ultra <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb300-nvl72/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GB300 NVL72</a> also follows a similar architecture, with NVLink unlocking up to 50x better performance per watt and 35x lower cost per token compared with the previous Hopper generation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The increasingly mission-critical role of NVLink is evidenced in its growing share of Nvidia’s data center revenues. Specifically, Nvidia’s networking sales have grown by more than 3.5x y/y to $11 billion Q4 – or about 18% of total data center sales in the period. NVLink was the primary driver, as the Grace Blackwell systems accounted for “roughly 2/3 of data center revenue in the quarter.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And Nvidia’s next-generation GPU accelerator roadmap will continue to imitate the system-based architecture like Grace Blackwell, underscoring the increasing importance of NVLink scale-up. Specifically, the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/vera-rubin-nvl72/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vera Rubin NVL72</a> will also scale 36 Vera CPUs and 72 Rubin GPUs in an Oberon rack structure. This was previously named the “<a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-unveils-rubin-cpx-a-new-class-of-gpu-designed-for-massive-context-inference\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX</a>,” as each GPU consists of two compute dies, resulting in 144 compute dies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next-generation Vera Rubin NVL72, which ships in the second half of the year, is estimated to provide “7.5x more AI performance” than its predecessor, the GB300 NVL72, while delivering “up to <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/vera-rubin-nvl72/\" rel=\"nofollow\">10x reduction</a> in inference token cost.” Nvidia estimates the next-generation Vera Rubin platform to enable monetization at $5 billion in token revenue for every $100 million invested – a critical consideration as power constraints remain the primary roadblock to hyperscaler AI deployments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The mission-critical role of NVLink scale-up technology is further evidenced in Nvidia’s enhanced Vera Rubin roadmap, which includes the <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-shows-off-rubin-ultra-with-600-000-watt-kyber-racks-and-infrastructure-coming-in-2027\" rel=\"nofollow\">NVL576</a> potentially shipping in 2H27. The system requires a “<a href=\"https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/nvidia-gtc-2025-built-for-reasoning-vera-rubin-kyber-cpo-dynamo-inference-jensen-math-feynman?open=false#%C2%A7jensen-math-changes-every-year\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kyber rack</a>” structure that’ll feature NVLink technology to scale up 288 GPU packages – or 576 compute dies. Amazon Web Services (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) is also expected to become the first external user of NVLink for scaling its in-house Trainium 4, Graviton, and AWS Nitro Systems.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>Spectrum-X Ethernet and InfiniBand</em></strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to NVLink scale-up technology, Nvidia also sells scale-out networking solutions that include its proprietary <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/spectrumx/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spectrum-X Ethernet</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/products/infiniband/\" rel=\"nofollow\">InfiniBand</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Spectrum-X was first introduced in 2023 as an optimized Ethernet solution for scaling AI clusters. It’s essentially a scale-out “package” that includes the Spectrum-X Ethernet switch for connecting racks and servers, endpoint Spectrum-X Ethernet SuperNIC adapters within the servers to facilitate low-latency cross-server communication, and supporting software to ensure smooth traffic flow and reduce network congestion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia also offers InfiniBand, which is another scale-out technology stack optimized for high-performance computing (“HPC”) applications. Unlike Ethernet, which is the most common scale-out networking standard observed in general-purpose data centers, InfiniBand was purpose-built for “ultra-fast processing.” This makes it another relevant scale-out networking solution in AI factories. Nvidia’s InfiniBand tech stack currently includes the <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/infiniband-adapters/\" rel=\"nofollow\">InfiniBand Adapters</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/infiniband-switching/\" rel=\"nofollow\">InfiniBand Switches</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/products/data-processing-unit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BlueField DPUs</a>, InfiniBand Routers, and InfiniBand-to-Ethernet <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/infiniband/gateway-systems/\" rel=\"nofollow\">gateway systems</a> to enable “ultra-low latency, extreme throughput” in processing increasingly complex and demanding workloads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, Nvidia’s Spectrum-X Ethernet and InfiniBand solutions represent mission-critical solutions for overcoming the scale-out bottleneck, ensuring optimized uptime in AI clusters that consist of increasingly powerful GPU accelerators, and enabling conversion of compute into monetizable tokens at scale.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>2. CUDA</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As discussed in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4788603-do-you-really-understand-huaweis-threat-to-nvidia-rating-downgrade\">previous coverage</a>, CUDA’s dominant adoption across developers remains a key moat for Nvidia, effectively reinforcing stickiness across its platform offerings. However, the software stack is also rapidly emerging as a critical pillar in enabling token spend optimization, further reinforcing adoption across the Nvidia ecosystem.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, CUDA software has been improving tokens per watt on older-generation platforms, enabling “up to 5x better performance on GB200 NVL72” within four months of GB300 NVL72’s launch. This proves that Nvidia’s efficiency gains are not restricted to hardware advancements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CUDA’s advantage also compounds over time; all of Nvidia’s GPUs are “architecturally compatible.” This means that a model that’s optimized on Blackwell today can also be deployed on prior-generation chips like Hopper or Ampere. This effectively optimizes the ROI trajectory on existing installed capacity, further supporting token spend optimization demands from customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is further corroborated by CUDA’s widespread adoption. According to management, there are currently more than 1.5 million AI models on Hugging Face that run on Nvidia CUDA, underscoring the platform’s fungibility, which is critical for reducing deployment friction and, effectively, lowering costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, CUDA’s advantage is clear in keeping demand resilient within Nvidia’s ecosystem. Not only does it reinforce developer adoption and platform standardization by making workloads highly portable across Nvidia’s installed base, but it also demonstrates the capability to overcome power constraints by unlocking incremental performance and tokens per watt. This effectively helps lower cost per token and improve ROI visibility, which Nvidia’s customers increasingly demand as AI infrastructure deployments scale.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>3. CPUs</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia’s upcoming <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/vera-cpu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vera CPU</a> shipments will represent its first standalone server processor. This compares to its predecessor, the <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-cpu-superchip/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grace CPU’s</a> debut in 2023, which was primarily deployed in rack-scale systems such as the Hopper-based <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GH200</a> and Blackwell-based GB200 and GB300.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Vera CPU debuts at an opportune time, as server processors gain relevance in post-training workloads. A key driver is the increasing adoption of AI agents, as discussed earlier. Unlike the commonly known chatbots like ChatGPT, which respond to text prompts, AI agents can complete tasks by using “tools” like search and data retrieval systems, databases, APIs, and enterprise-specific applications (e.g., CRM, ERP systems). These “tools” are typically processed by CPUs because they’re low in complexity and less compute-intensive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For instance, CRM and ERP workloads are mostly defined by “serial” actions like sending a query and waiting for actions, which are logic-heavy and typically scale well on CPUs. This differs from complex workloads like AI training, where GPUs are needed to facilitate parallel calculations – or processing multiple tasks across multiple processors at the same time. The upcoming Vera CPUs were purpose-built for facilitating these post-training workloads, both as a standalone chip environment or in a GPU-accelerated environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The upcoming launch of Vera CPUs also coincides with increasing revenue diversification beyond hyperscaler applications. As I’ve discussed extensively in my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872936-intel-the-cpu-comeback-is-an-execution-reality-check\">recent coverage</a> on Intel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC\" title=\"Intel Corporation\">INTC</a>), CPUs are making a comeback in AI compute—especially in enterprise deployments. Specifically, enterprise end-markets are increasingly preferring upgrades of existing general-purpose data center infrastructure to accommodate AI workflows rather than engaging in costly AI factory builds. The diversification of AI workloads into high-volume inference also requires scalability, which CPUs can efficiently address. Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) currently predicts the server CPU TAM to grow in “strong double-digits in 2026” given their reprised role in supporting the ongoing AI ramp.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And Nvidia Vera’s imminent relevance in complementing the AI buildout is evident in the company’s latest data center revenue mix. Specifically, management’s disclosed that the top 5 cloud providers and hyperscalers now account for just “a little over 50%” of the company’s Q4 data center revenues. This suggests a broadening of demand to other verticals like enterprise and sovereign deployments, which the Vera CPU is a compelling solution for.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Fundamental Considerations</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Adjusting my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4844758-the-special-purpose-vehicle-spv-ecosystem-powering-nvidia-explained\">previous forecast</a> for Nvidia’s actual fiscal Q4 results and forward outlook, I expect FY 2027 revenue to grow 68% y/y to $361.7 billion. This will continue to be anchored by data center sales, which I forecast to sustain long-term growth at a four-year CAGR of 18.2% through FY 2031.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53884093-17721241156981785.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nvidia financial forecast\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"602\" height=\"166\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53884093-17721241156981785.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53884093-17721241156981785.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53884093-17721241156981785.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The assumption considers Nvidia’s pivoting focus towards optimizing tokens per watt at system-level sales rather than GPU-focused deployments alone. This strategy could reinforce long-term alignment with customers’ evolving priorities as the market moves from “build at all costs” to scalable compute monetization. The continued momentum in data center sales is also expected to bolster the durability of Nvidia’s long-term earnings accretion, supported by its industry-leading gross margins sustained in the mid-70% range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53884093-17721241157793899.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nvidia financial forecast\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"601\" height=\"186\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53884093-17721241157793899.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53884093-17721241157793899.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53884093-17721241157793899.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Price Considerations</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, I’m increasing my price target for the stock to<strong><em> $197 per share</em></strong>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53884093-17721241153098452.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nvidia price target valuation analysis\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"607\" height=\"177\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53884093-17721241153098452.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53884093-17721241153098452.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53884093-17721241153098452.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The price is determined by a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis on the above fundamental projections.

Total cash flow projections, including the terminal value, are discounted at a 9.9% WACC in line with Nvidia’s capital structure and risk profile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53884093-17721241160734248.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nvidia price target valuation analysis\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"602\" height=\"208\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53884093-17721241160734248.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53884093-17721241160734248.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53884093-17721241160734248.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the ongoing AI infrastructure buildout continues to be led by robust end-market demand for compute, the next phase is becoming increasingly defined by constraints in power and networking availability. This contrasts with previous roadblocks that were primarily driven by GPU supply constraints. As explained by Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) CEO Satya Nadella in a recent podcast interview, GPU deployment remains a function of limited power availability:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>…the biggest issue we are now having is not a compute glut, but it’s power — it’s sort of the ability to get the builds done fast enough close to power... So, if you can’t do that, you may actually have a bunch of chips sitting in inventory that I can’t plug in. In fact, that is my problem today. It’s not a supply issue of chips; it’s actually the fact that I don’t have warm shells to plug into.</p> <p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-ceo-says-the-company-doesnt-have-enough-electricity-to-install-all-the-ai-gpus-in-its-inventory-you-may-actually-have-a-bunch-of-chips-sitting-in-inventory-that-i-cant-plug-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">CEO Satya Nadella, Bg2 Podcast</a>.</em></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This accordingly brings into light the increasing importance of optimizing tokens per watt, which Nvidia continues to deliver not just through GPU advancements but also innovations in the adjacent networking, CUDA software, and CPU roadmaps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Admittedly, execution risks remain, with a headline overhang from lingering investors’ angst over the durability of AI capex and limited visibility into related investment returns. However, it’s likely Nvidia offers a solution to this concern, which remains underappreciated.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia’s latest selloff, despite the execution consistency observed in its latest earnings results, has potentially created an opportunity to participate in an impending re-rate as AI infrastructure priorities shift. As customers move from “build at all costs” toward tokens per watt optimization – not by choice, but due to fixed power availability – Nvidia’s full-stack positioning has again emerged as a competitive advantage. It’s likely that increasing system-level bottlenecks, particularly in power and networking, could emerge as a catalyst worth watching through the year, as it influences customer buying behavior and potentially skews demand further towards Nvidia’s full-stack data center solutions. This potential steepening of its forward revenue curve could support multiple expansions from current levels, underscoring further upside potential ahead.</p>",

This has caused Geron to shift their focus from expanding RYTELO’s marketing team to a “strategic restructuring” that included laying off a large chunk of its employees. And, unfortunately, there isn’t much for investors to chew on outside of RYTELO in myelodysplastic syndrome. While RYTELO is also being evaluated in myelofibrosis—with interim results expected later this year—management has stated its base case is waiting for the final Overall Survival analysis in the second half of 2028. That’s still over a couple of years away for those who’ve lost track of time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the paragraphs that follow, I take a closer look at Geron’s Q4 performance and try to get an idea of what the stock is priced for.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">GERN Q4 Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">RYTELO generated $48 million in net product revenue in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721216367009902_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"824\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721216367009902_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" width=\"640\" height=\"258\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721216367009902_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721216367009902_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721216367009902_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48050289-17721216367009902_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Compilation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">RYTELO’s Q4 performance was essentially flat QoQ and YoY—which is not ordinarily a good sign for a drug that just recently launched.

It does sound less expensive, and the goal of marketing is to maximize ROI, so we'll see what comes of it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors may have also been spooked by an impending shelf registration and at-the-market filing. But management framed it as “<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874680-geron-corporation-gern-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">corporate housekeeping</a>.” While the company is flush with ~$400 million in cash, it is <em>still</em> burning through capital. So it wouldn’t be totally unexpected for them to raise cash at the expense of shareholders (dilution). But I think this is unlikely unless Geron has other plans up its sleeve (e.g., M&amp;A activity).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside of the US market, things are looking tricky. Despite achieving <a href=\"https://s201.q4cdn.com/710325604/files/doc_news/Geron-Announces-European-Commission-Approval-of-RYTELO-imetelstat-a-First-in-Class-Telomerase-Inhibitor-for-the-Treatment-of-Adults-W-QCEM9.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">European approval</a> in March 2025, Geron is not “gung ho” on shipping RYTELO overseas just yet:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>Well, so we do have a European approval, right? So that's one thing which is actually derisked, which is a great thing. But of course, European approval without funding is a much more limited positive outside.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From reading the transcript, it seems that EU payers are unwilling to meet their price expectations. So RYTELO’s ex-US opportunity may be passed on to “<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874680-geron-corporation-gern-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">like-minded partners</a>.” Of course, developments on the partnership front would be welcome, but I don’t think Geron is going to get a great deal on any ex-US RYTELO partnership given its stagnant US performance so far.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04576156\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">IMpactMF</a> trial interim results are still pegged for 2H 2026, and management is still…managing expectations ahead of the interim readout.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>Overall survival is the primary endpoint, and our confidence in this endpoint is supported by encouraging survival outcomes observed in the Phase II EMBARK trial, which informed the design of the IMpactMF trial. While our base case from a planning perspective remains progression to the final analysis in second half of 2028, reaching the interim analysis represents an <em>important</em> milestone as we continue to advance imetelstat's potential beyond lower-risk MDS. An earlier positive outcome would represent an upside scenario without planning.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So investors shouldn’t bank on an early stop for efficacy—which implies that a myelofibrosis launch remains years away.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pharma DCF Model</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ll admit that I am a nerd, but I am excited to formally model RYTELO in both myelodysplastic syndrome and myelofibrosis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For myelodysplastic syndrome, Geron cited an 8k 2L US population. I went with a 15% peak share given that the majority of RYTELO’s scripts are for 3L+. The big kicker here is launch opex—which is unusually high for Geron.

It assumes that opex suddenly drops to 50% in 2027 and beyond, which may not be realistic. It also assumes that RYTELO’s revenue peaks at $400 million. But if you reference the first table earlier in the article, it is totally possible that RYTELO is peaking much earlier than usual. So the market could very well be discounting RYTELO for these reasons, and one cannot blame it for doing so.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Words</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While it’s hard to be bearish on a stock that appears undervalued, I think GERN is undervalued for good reason (maintain \"Sell\").</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">RYTELO’s market performance (e.g., flat revenues YoY) suggests that it is largely viewed as a salvage therapy in myelodysplastic syndrome. Progress in myelofibrosis remains years off, and I’m not entirely sold on IMpactMF’s prospects. Imetelstat is up against “best available therapy,” and Overall Survival is not an easy endpoint.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I am bearish on GERN, there are some things that could feasibly happen that could change my mind: improved RYTELO uptake in myelodysplastic syndrome, a clinically meaningful win in IMpactMF, encouraging pipeline developments, ex-US partnerships, and a sooner-than-expected pivot to profitability.</p>",

I had given the stock a \"Buy\" rating on this potential, along with sales of LINZESS [linaclotide] increasing. Today, I'm downgrading this stock from a \"Buy\" rating to a \"Sell.\" There are several reasons for doing so at this present time, which I'm about to go over now. The first reason is because the hope was that once Ironwood saw the data of CNP-104 treating patients with PBC, it would like what it saw.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, it would choose to exercise its option to exclusively license CNP-104 for the treatment of these liver disease patients. Unfortunately, that's not what happened at all. Upon observing the topline data from COUR Pharmaceutical Development Company, Inc. [COUR], Ironwood notified it on September 27, 2024 [<strong><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1446847/000110465924115052/tm2427582d1_ex99-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1446847/000110465924115052/tm2427582d1_ex99-1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Pipeline Update subsection note under CNP-104</a></strong>] that it would not exercise its option to acquire an exclusive license to CNP-104. This pipeline setback is the first reason for the downgrade rating. The second reason is because the hope is that LINZESS sales would continue to increase, but something bad happened with earnings the other day. It was noted that sales decreased by 6% to $864.5 million in 2025 compared to that of 2024, with sales of $916.3 million. It believes that LINZESS had fallen short because of the phasing of gross-to-net rebate reserves and pricing headwinds for Medicare Part D.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is bullish, with a projection of a 30% increase in full-year 2026 LINZESS U.S. sales to be between $1.125 and $1.175 billion. Despite this, it remains to be seen if it can actually execute such an expected increase. What is bullish is that it met with the FDA in Q4 of 2025 to advance apraglutide as a once-weekly, long-acting synthetic glucagon-like peptide-2 [GLP-2] analog to treat patients with short bowel syndrome with intestinal failure [SBS-IF]. A phase 3 study, known as STARS-2 for this program, is expected to initiate in Q2 of 2026. The major downside is that while this program is encouraging, a regulatory application for approval is not expected to happen until maybe around 2028/2029. Plus, that is only to happen if the primary endpoint of the study is met in a statistically significant manner.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Phase 3 Study Initiation Is Bullish But Could Take Several Years For Catalyst Or Meaningful Impact</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I want to go over is a potential way that Ironwood Pharmaceuticals might be able to redeem itself and boost shareholder value. As I stated above, it believes that full-year 2026 LINZESS sales are going to increase by 30%, with a projection of sales between $1.125 and $1.175 billion. However, what it does have going for it is that it already met with the FDA in Q4 of 2025. This meeting was set in place to discuss the potential of moving apraglutide forward for the treatment of patients with short bowel syndrome with intestinal failure [SBS-IF]. As a matter of fact, there was alignment on a confirmatory phase 3 study that would be required to potentially obtain FDA approval of this drug for the treatment of these patients, to be known as STARS-2. The truth is that the company already established efficacy in a large phase 3 trial known as STARS. Before going over the clinical data released from this specific late-stage study, plus any catalysts to come from it for investors to look forward to, I believe it is first important to go over what this disorder is and what the market opportunity for the company could end up being.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.shortbowelsyndrome.com/sbs-management?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=UB+%7C+SBS+%7C+hydration/diet+%7C+GOOG+%7C+DSE+%7C+FY25&amp;utm_content=Hydration&amp;utm_term=short+gut+dehydration&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21784653015&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA9cSBmH31xuYSt4-lj_11JA3oL76H&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2dDuvbn3kgMVt7haBR2ppyqLEAMYASAAEgIwPfD_BwE#SBSdiet\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.shortbowelsyndrome.com/sbs-management?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=UB+%7C+SBS+%7C+hydration/diet+%7C+GOOG+%7C+DSE+%7C+FY25&amp;utm_content=Hydration&amp;utm_term=short+gut+dehydration&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21784653015&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA9cSBmH31xuYSt4-lj_11JA3oL76H&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2dDuvbn3kgMVt7haBR2ppyqLEAMYASAAEgIwPfD_BwE#SBSdiet\" target=\"_blank\">Short Bowel Syndrome [SBS]</a></strong> is a type of disorder where the small intestine is surgically removed. Either that or it is damaged and dysfunctional. The problem with these items is that if the small intestine is missing or can't perform its function, then it can't adequately absorb nutrients from food. This causes malabsorption for the patient, which in turn causes a host of symptoms that these patients have to deal with, such as the following :</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em><strong>Food sensitivity</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Bloating </strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Heartburn </strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Dehydration </strong></em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of the need for surgical removal of the small intestine, this can be caused by several reasons as well, which are :</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em><strong>Crohn's Disease </strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Blood clots of arteries to the small intestine </strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Cancer </strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Injury of some sort </strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Birth defect </strong></em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Short Bowel Syndrome with intestinal failure [SBS-IF] is just; that with a missing or ineffective intestine, nutrients can't be absorbed at all. Such patients are in desperate need of parenteral support [PS], where intravenous nutrients and fluids are given to patients. Especially when oral intake isn't even an option at all. The market opportunity in the United States alone is sufficient for the company to tackle. It is expected that the U.S. short bowel syndrome market is <strong><a href=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/short-bowel-syndrome-market-107071#:~:text=The%20global%20short%20bowel%20syndrome,such%20as%20higher%20diagnosis%20rates.\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/short-bowel-syndrome-market-107071#:~:text=The%20global%20short%20bowel%20syndrome,such%20as%20higher%20diagnosis%20rates.\" target=\"_blank\">expected to reach $1.93 billion by 2032</a></strong>. The thing is that it remains to be seen whether the company is going to be able to achieve a successful outcome from its confirmatory phase 3 STARS-2 study using its GLP-2 analog apraglutide to treat these SBS-IF patients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The thing is that the company can go after an unmet medical need for sure. There is one major reason why I believe this is the case. The main reason is that these patients are dependent on parenteral support [PS]. Why is this a bad thing? That's because the cost for such support is outrageous. Consider that the range for such PS is estimated to be <strong><a href=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/short-bowel-syndrome-market-107071#:~:text=The%20global%20short%20bowel%20syndrome,such%20as%20higher%20diagnosis%20rates.\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/short-bowel-syndrome-market-107071#:~:text=The%20global%20short%20bowel%20syndrome,such%20as%20higher%20diagnosis%20rates.\" target=\"_blank\">between $65,000 and $320,000 annually</a></strong>. Furthermore, it is not ideal to be dependent upon long-term care with PS. The reason why is because long-term use is associated with several problems like catheter sepsis, liver dysfunction, and more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is only one drug approved right now for SBS, and it is GLP-2 <strong><a href=\"https://www.gattexhcp.com/moa/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=BR+%7C+gattex+%7C+moa+%7C+GOOG+%7C+HCP+%7C+FY25&amp;utm_content=GATTEX+Core&amp;utm_term=GATTEX&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21797896036&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA9cSAXTeS1Reieo2W147vjZ5t0FH4&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlIz40Lz3kgMViKNaBR1oJS2iEAAYASAAEgJ5S_D_BwE\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.gattexhcp.com/moa/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=BR+%7C+gattex+%7C+moa+%7C+GOOG+%7C+HCP+%7C+FY25&amp;utm_content=GATTEX+Core&amp;utm_term=GATTEX&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21797896036&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA9cSAXTeS1Reieo2W147vjZ5t0FH4&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlIz40Lz3kgMViKNaBR1oJS2iEAAYASAAEgJ5S_D_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">GATTEX [teduglutide]</a></strong> from <strong>Takeda Pharmaceuticals</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TAK\" title=\"Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited\">TAK</a>). The downside, from what I see, is that this must be taken once daily as a subcutaneous [SC] injection. There is once- or twice-weekly glepaglutide from Zealand Pharma, which succeeded in phase 3 testing treating patients with SBS. However, in late 2024, it <strong><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/19/3000220/0/en/U-S-Food-and-Drug-Administration-issues-Complete-Response-Letter-for-the-glepaglutide-New-Drug-Application-for-the-treatment-of-short-bowel-syndrome.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/19/3000220/0/en/U-S-Food-and-Drug-Administration-issues-Complete-Response-Letter-for-the-glepaglutide-New-Drug-Application-for-the-treatment-of-short-bowel-syndrome.html\" target=\"_blank\">was given a Complete Response Letter [CRL]</a></strong> citing that more data would be needed to obtain regulatory approval. From what it appears with this CRL, one phase 3 study doesn't appear to be enough to confirm benefit. That's why when Ironwood met with the FDA in April of 2025, it was notified that it must run the phase 3 confirmatory STARS-2 study in order to be able to file an NDA of apraglutide for the treatment of patients with SBS-IF.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To this end, Ironwood is preparing to initiate the confirmatory phase 3 STARS-2 trial in Q2 of 2026. The hope is that apraglutide is going to achieve statistical significance yet again with respect to the intended primary efficacy endpoint of relative change from baseline of weekly PS volume over a 24-week period. The thing is that this program appears to be a good one, but the problem is that such a study could take a few years to run. Plus, there is no way of knowing at this point if the primary efficacy endpoint is going to be met in a statistically significant manner. There is a good chance of it happening, since the company proved to achieve this very endpoint from the prior <strong><a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04627025?term=STARS%20SBS&amp;rank=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04627025?term=STARS%20SBS&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\">STARS study</a></strong>, which I'm about to go over now. The thing to note first is that there were a total of 164 patients with SBS-IF that were recruited. They were first split into two different categories in 50/50 fashion :</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em><strong>Stoma - colon lead out to create a pouch for waste to come from </strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Colon-in-continuity - normal or near-normal bowel movements still possible </strong></em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After patients were divided in this fashion, they were then randomized 2:1 to receive either of the following treatments :</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em><strong>Once-weekly apragrlutide </strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Placebo comparator </strong></em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The primary endpoint for this STARS study is the same as that which has been established for the soon-to-be-initiated STARS-2 study.

Another way to look at this is in terms of drop in PS volume, which is as follows :</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em><strong>-25.5 PS drop for patients who took apraglutide </strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>-12.5 PS drop for patients on placebo </strong></em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The notion here is that what was achieved for STARS must now again be replicated in STARS-2. The problem again with this is that this study has not yet been initiated and will not be done so until Q2 of 2026. Plus, it is going to be a few years before data is even released from this trial. Of course, if the primary endpoint is met, then I would expect an NDA filing of apraglutide for the treatment of patients with SBS-IF shortly thereafter. What about the competition? If the company can get data right, then it might be able to fend them off with one competitive advantage, which is dosing. Apraglutide is the only long-acting, once-weekly GLP-2 that is known to treat these patients.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financials</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ironwood Pharmaceuticals <strong><a href=\"https://investor.ironwoodpharma.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2026/Ironwood-Pharmaceuticals-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results-Achieves-2025-Financial-Guidance-and-Reiterates-Strong-2026-Outlook/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investor.ironwoodpharma.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2026/Ironwood-Pharmaceuticals-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results-Achieves-2025-Financial-Guidance-and-Reiterates-Strong-2026-Outlook/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">ended Q4 of 2025 with $215.5 million in cash</a></strong>, compared to the same time period in 2024, where it only ended with $88.6 million. Financially, the company does have debt on its books to mention. This would be in terms of the $200 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes, which are due in June of 2026. On the flip side, it also has about $385 million in the aggregate principal amount of a Revolving Credit Facility that it can tap into. It entered into this credit facility back in 2023, and it was done to partially fund the VectivBio acquisition. Despite cash inflows from the revenues to be generated by LINZESS, plus the Revolving Credit Facility I just went over above, it believes that this will only be enough to fund its operations for at least the next 12 months. It burns roughly $41.15 million of cash per quarter. This is broken down into $21.86 million in R&amp;D expenses and then $19.29 million in SG&amp;A expenses.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks To Business</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are several risks that investors should be aware of before investing in Ironwood Pharmaceuticals. The first risk to consider is in terms of the recent guidance given, which is that it expects full-year 2026 U.S. revenues of LINZESS to increase by 30% to a range of $1.125 and $1.175 billion. The risk here is that there is no assurance that the initial headwinds observed in Q4 of 2025 won't be carried over in 2026. Nor that the company is going to be able to meet its guidance of LINZESS sales as expected for full-year 2026. Especially when you consider that from 2024 to 2025, it saw a decline in full-year sales of this drug. In 2024, it posted U.S. sales of LINZESS to be $916.3 million. However, in 2025, full-year sales decreased by 6% to $864.5 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second risk to consider would be in terms of its development of its GLP-2 analog apraglutide for the treatment of patients with SBS-IF. It gained alignment with the FDA that a confirmatory phase 3 study is going to be necessary for it to be in a future position for it to file an NDA of this drug for the treatment of these patients. The risk here is that upon the release of data from the soon-to-be initiated phase 3 STARS-2 study, there is no guarantee that the final primary endpoint of relative change from baseline of actual weekly PS volume is going to be met in a statistically significant manner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The third and final risk to consider would be that of the competition I went over above. As I mentioned beforehand, Takeda Pharmaceutical has the only GLP-2 drug approved for the treatment of patients with SBS-IF, known as GATTEX. Plus, there is the competition that could come about if Zealand Pharma can eventually obtain FDA approval of its drug glepaglutide for these patients. Where Ironwood could possibly gain a competitive edge is in terms of dosing. Its long-acting, once-weekly dosing of apraglutide could be crucial over these other therapies, which require additional dosing throughout the week. The risk here is that there is no guarantee that the final outcome from the phase 3 STARS-2 study is going to establish such a competitive advantage. Nor that apraglutide from Ironwood will be approved to treat these SBS-IF patients that it will be able to produce sufficient revenues from it.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The hope was that the company would be able to execute on several measures to continue to warrant a \"Buy\" rating from me. However, the company failed to move forward with exercising its option to exclusively license CNP-104 for the treatment of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]. This was a major setback for its pipeline and the first reason for my downgrade. The second reason, again, is because U.S. sales just posted for LINZESS in Q4 of 2025 decreased. It remains to be seen if it is going to be able to meet its full-year 2026 U.S. sales expectation guided to be in that range of $1.125 and $1.175 billion. Apraglutide appears to be going well, but it is going to be a few years before data is known for this candidate. Plus, even if the primary endpoint is met for the STARS-2 study, Ironwood would still need to be able to obtain U.S. marketing approval for it. With everything listed above, I think that this stock should be downgraded to a \"Sell\" rating.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The company has a strong AI exposure because of the strengthening foothold of its Networking Platforms<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> segment, which offers high-performance connectivity solutions for AI infrastructure. Ciena demonstrates everything that I appreciate as a value investors: accelerating revenue growth, operating leverage, a healthy balance sheet, and a stable outstanding shares count. Valuation might be a notable area of concern, but I think that highly probable positive earnings revisions after the upcoming earnings release will help mitigate this risk. Moreover, I believe that at least over the next few quarters, the power of momentum will outshine CIEN's high multiples. All in all, I assign a Buy rating to CIEN.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fundamentals and earnings preview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/77319676\">latest 10-K report</a>, Ciena is described as a network technology company that provides hardware, software, and services to a wide range of network operators. The company's major segment is Networking Platforms, which generated 77% of Ciena's consolidated sales in FQ4 2025.

However, I like the fact that it demonstrates proactiveness and flexibility, as the share of non-telco revenues has increased significantly over the last few years. As of FQ4 2025, the proportion of non-telco revenue increased to 55%, and the lion's portion of this non-telco revenue is represented by contracts with direct cloud providers. Moreover, the share of sales generated from direct cloud providers is consistently expanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721043362904837_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1297\" data-height=\"662\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721043362904837_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Ciena's latest earnings presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"327\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721043362904837_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721043362904837_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721043362904837_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721043362904837_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ciena's latest earnings presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ciena released its latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20336340-ciena-reports-fiscal-fourth-quarter-2025-and-year-end-financial-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">quarterly earnings</a> on December 11, delivering a third <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4530430-ciena-non-gaap-eps-of-0_91-beats-by-0_14-revenue-of-1_35b-beats-by-60m\">dual beat</a> in a row. Revenue increased by 20% on a YoY basis, while the EPS increased much faster, from $0.54 to $0.91. It was a high-quality EPS growth as it was powered by increased profitability ratios. Ciena's adjusted operating margin increased from 9.7% to 11.2% YoY in Q4.

For the fiscal year 2026, the management expects the adjusted operating margin to expand by almost six percentage points, to 17%. Moreover, the $5.9 billion midpoint of the revenue guidance range means that full-year revenue growth is poised to accelerate to almost 24% from the 18% increase recorded in FY2025. Therefore, Ciena's already extremely strong <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIEN/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a> with very low leverage and ample liquidity is poised to strengthen further and expand the company's financial flexibility. This is another big positive fundamental factor because Ciena invests quite aggressively in R&amp;D; <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIEN/income-statement\">~18% of sales</a> were reinvested in R&amp;D during FY2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-1772105816055346.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"424\" height=\"433\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-1772105816055346.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-1772105816055346.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ciena's FQ1 2026 earnings are around the corner as the company is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIEN/earnings\">set to report</a> on March 5. Wall Street analysts expect CIEN to deliver accelerated revenue growth compared to Q4 2025, with a projected 30% increase. The company's unit economics is expected to improve substantially as Wall Street analysts expect a staggering 81.5% adjusted EPS growth. The fact that there have been only positive <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIEN/earnings/revisions\">EPS revisions</a> over the last 90 days indicates that Wall Street analysts are extremely optimistic about CIEN's ability to deliver a solid earnings surprise next week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721060187595189.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"590\" height=\"207\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721060187595189.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721060187595189.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721060187595189.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is difficult not to agree with Wall Street's optimism because Ciena has a proven record of capitalizing on the global AI data center spending spree. The calendar Q4 earnings season of the largest investors in AI infrastructure revealed their accelerated investments in capex during the last three months of 2025. Moreover, all giants confirmed that they plan to increase investments in AI-related capex in 2026 as well. Therefore, the increasing demand for connectivity from hyperscalers creates a substantial structural tailwind for Ciena.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, during the fresh earnings release, Nvidia's management provided the public with several bullish insights regarding the longevity of AI tailwinds. According to CEO <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875147-nvidia-corporation-2026-q4-results-earnings-call-presentation\">Jensen Huang and his colleagues</a>, \"frontier agentic systems have reached an inflection point\" meaning that tokens are becoming profitable. It is a crucial development that demonstrates that the market's fears regarding uncertainty of returns from increasing AI capex were highly likely overblown.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, Nvidia's management also said during their earnings call that the next generation of its AI accelerators, the Rubin platform, will reduce inference token costs by up to 10 times compared to Blackwell. It implies that profitability per token will significantly improve further, making new investments more and more justified from an economic perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With all that being said, I expect an extremely bullish tone from Ciena's management during the next week's earnings call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721085751798923_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"867\" data-height=\"272\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721085751798923_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha\" width=\"640\" height=\"201\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721085751798923_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721085751798923_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721085751798923_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721085751798923_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the power of momentum should not be underestimated, especially when we speak about a company with expanding margins and a strong balance sheet like Ciena. The stock is gaining more attention from investors, which drives the demand and pushes the share price further. Since CIEN boasts a strong balance sheet and expanding FCF-generating capacity, shareholders are extremely unlikely to suffer from a potential dilution of equity investors via new share issues. Despite the sharp share price increase over the last twelve months, the number of outstanding shares <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIEN/balance-sheet\">was stable in 2025</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation as a major risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When any stock soars by over 300% within a year, there always will be discussions about the fairness of the company's valuation. Looking at the company's multiples, it will not be an exaggeration to say that CIEN is priced to perfection. The company's current <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIEN/valuation/metrics\">valuation ratios</a> are higher than the sector median and its own historical averages by hundreds of percent across the board.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721091528565342_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"873\" data-height=\"713\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721091528565342_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha\" width=\"640\" height=\"523\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721091528565342_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721091528565342_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721091528565342_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721091528565342_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The only ratio that looks reasonable is the forward-adjusted PEG ratio of 1.51, which is just above the sector median. The market currently prices extremely aggressive growth for years ahead, and before the AI revolution, I could have said that it is a big red flag. However, we are witnessing an unprecedented secular shift to AI, which requires vast amounts of compute power. Hyperscalers are ready to further boost aggressive investments in AI infrastructure because they already see that AI capabilities help them to unlock new revenue growth and profitability expansion drivers. With that being said, I think that CIEN is extremely likely to see many more new upward earnings revisions, which will mitigate the overvaluation risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721164579322176_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"822\" data-height=\"728\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721164579322176_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha\" width=\"640\" height=\"567\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721164579322176_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721164579322176_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721164579322176_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721164579322176_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, CIEN's massive share price momentum is actually a two-edged sword. While a soaring share price attracts more new investors, it also urges current investors to take fat gains earned over the last twelve months. Moreover, quite aggressive insider selling in January and February might set the tone for external equity holders to sell as well. Finally, the fact that the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIEN/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">consensus target price is lower than the last close by 30%</a> might also undermine investors' desire to keep CIEN in their portfolios for longer.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To conclude, I think that CIEN is a Buy. Yes, the stock is priced to perfection. However, in the current environment of rapidly accelerating AI tailwinds, I think that we will see several additional significant upward earnings revisions. New revisions and earnings surprises will mean compression of the P/E ratio, which will inevitably improve attractiveness of CIEN for investors.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's fundamentals are solid, with a fortress balance sheet and rapidly expanding margins. Moreover, let's not forget about the power of momentum, which usually attracts additional investors and drives the demand for the stock. Since CIEN is not aggressive in issuing new shares, the highly probable increase in the demand for the company's stock will inevitably push the share price further.</p>",

Overall, the ETF does its job on a standalone basis but underperforms its peer group.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Composition - Slightly Higher Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let us see what the ETF is currently holding:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48943276-17720197984257364.png?io=w640\" alt=\"facts\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"221\" height=\"256\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Current Holdings <span>(Fund Fact Sheet)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund has a 37% allocation to high yield, a 31% investment-grade corporate allocation, a 3.3% EM allocation, and roughly 20% in securitized products (overweight CMBS). The ETF presents a further refinement in each subclass, parsing each group by rating. The general allocation, though, is summarized as such:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>HY Corp: 37%</li> <li>IG Corp: 31%</li> <li>Securitized: 20%</li> <li>EM: 3.3%</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a ratings standpoint, the current parsing is as follows:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48943276-17720200079733825.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ratings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"223\" height=\"212\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Ratings <span>(Fund Fact Sheet)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Roughly 50% of the fund holdings are investment grade, while the rest are composed of high-yield exposures. On the high-yield side, the fund is overweight higher quality BB names, which make up 24% of the fund. The ETF only has a 3.4% bucket for 'CCC' issuers. Since our article last year, the fund has increased its high-yield exposure <span>slightly</span>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other analytics for the name are as follows:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>AUM: $4.4 billion</li> <li>Expense ratio: 0.39%</li> <li>SEC yield: 5.7%</li> <li>Payment period: monthly</li> <li>Duration: 4.2 years</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Please note the ETF also increased its duration slightly from 4 years to 4.2 years since the last time we reviewed it. Given the compression in spreads overall in the market, the name is taking more credit and duration risk to make up for some of the lost yield.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Spreads Have Compressed in the Market</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the ETF does not take significant risks via its composition, it is nonetheless affected by overall IG and HY spreads. If we get another risk-off period like in April 2025, investors should expect the name to post another significant drawdown. For every 100 bps in spread widening, the fund should go down by -4.2%. Let us take a look at overall credit spreads in the market:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48943276-17720210279281607_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"725\" data-height=\"502\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48943276-17720210279281607_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"443\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48943276-17720210279281607_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48943276-17720210279281607_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48943276-17720210279281607_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48943276-17720210279281607_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IG &amp; HY spreads <span>(YCharts)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We have graphed two indices in the above, namely the US High Yield Master OAS as a proxy for high-yield spreads and the US Corporate BBB OAS as a proxy for IG spreads (namely BBB spreads). As we can see from the YChart above, both net figures are at historic lows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While high yield spreads went as high as 9% during Covid, they were as wide as 6% during 2022, while they are now at only 2.95%. Similarly, IG spreads were close to 2% during 2022 now only half. The point to be taken from the graphs above is that spreads are very, very low, and the next natural move is up (i.e., wider spreads). As we saw from the analytics section, 100 bps in widening means a -4.2% drawdown.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rating downgrade warranted</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We are looking at an ETF that has increased its risk profile<span> slightly</span>, all while spreads are very tight. We like this name, and it has performed robustly; however, the next move here will likely see a -4% to -5% drawdown, similarly to April 2025. As an investor, one can consider CGMS a low risk fund, but you want to buy when there is a dislocation in spreads, not when they are tight.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also to note, the ETF has underperformed its cohort; thus, investors have more conservative choices currently when it comes to the same type of risk. We are downgrading this ETF to 'Hold' based on the above factors. This purely means today's price is not a good entry point from a macro standpoint, all while the fund is still expected to deliver as per its analytics.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CGMS is a fixed income exchange traded fund. The name is an active take on intermediate fixed income, with allocations to IG, HY, and securitized products. The name has a low standard deviation but did produce a -4% drawdown in April 2025. Expect a similar price action for a 100 bps widening in spreads from here. We find the fund to be a robust long-term holding but do not consider today's price a good entry point.</p>",

EPS performance of -$0.20 and the consensus FY2028 adj. EPS estimates of $0.02.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These perhaps explain the stock's excellent support at the established trading floor of the $7.50s over the past few months, despite the dilutive capital raise effect on the long-term shareholders' equity to shares outstanding of 222.34M (+18.7% YoY).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>NVTS Presents Swing Trade Opportunity - Hold Reiterated</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/54998043-1771982585907941_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1814\" data-height=\"887\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/54998043-1771982585907941_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NVTS 5Y Stock Price\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"313\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/54998043-1771982585907941_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/54998043-1771982585907941_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/54998043-1771982585907941_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/54998043-1771982585907941_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">NVTS 5Y Stock Price <span>(<span></span></span>TradingView<span>)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, NVTS has remained well supported along the $7.50s/$8s since October 2025, with the stock notably growing into its premium valuations as it consolidates along the 50/100/200-day moving averages.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite their robust sampling cadence, I am of the opinion that the stock is likely to continue trading sideways in the intermediate term, attributed to the ongoing sampling process and the delayed high-voltage GaN monetization opportunities sometime in 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These reasons are also why NVTS presents a potential swing trade opportunity at an approximate four/five-week cycle, along the established floor at $7.50 ranges and the approximate exit points at the resistance levels of $10 ranges.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The historical trading cycle since October 2025 offers traders an excellent way to ride the intermediate-term volatility, especially since the stock still reports an elevated short interest ratio of 17.50% by the time of writing.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Otherwise, pending their design/contract wins, the materialization of their growth roadmap, and the narrower net losses, I am of the opinion that NVTS remains rather speculative at current premium levels - resulting in my reiterated Hold rating here.</p>",

At least here we have a clear example of AI increasing revenues and therefore demand.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The “White-Collar Collapse” Requires a Hiring Freeze That Isn’t There</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Citrini assumes displaced workers won’t be reabsorbed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This flies in the face of what we have seen throughout history. Money is being spent in different places, perhaps, but someone has to carry out this infrastructure rollout, and the money is being spread out.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We added $11B in Data Center revenue across a diverse and expanding set of customers including cloud providers, hyperscalers, AI model makers, enterprises, and sovereign nations.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: Nvidia Earnings Call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If anything, we could argue that money is moving away from being concentrated in a few large companies, which tend to accumulate it in their fortress balance sheets, and getting closer to the real economy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Agentic AI Is Not Destroying SaaS</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Citrini’s SaaS reflexivity argument is interesting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In essence, the argument is that AI doesn’t need to fully replace software to damage it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Agentic coding tools are enough of a threat that they shift the balance of power and force SaaS to cut prices and costs and themselves double down on AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But Nvidia addressed what comes next during the call:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Demand… continues to strengthen as inference deployments grow in addition to training.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Tokens are profitable… driving extreme urgency to scale up compute.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see it as a Jevons paradox. Making SaaS cheaper and better, through Agentic AI, actually increases the demand and TAM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The system does not shrink, though it does become more compute-heavy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Margin Story Doesn’t Look Like a Commodity Collapse</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Citrini’s scenario assumes compute becomes commoditized, which would lead to a collapse in margins for Nvidia, but this does not fit the reality at this time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As stated during the call, Nvidia is guiding:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>75% gross margins</p></li> <li><p>Sustained mid-70s full-year outlook</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The single most important lever of our gross margins is actually delivering generational leads to our customers.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If performance per watt drives revenue per rack, and Nvidia maintains generational leads, then pricing power will persist.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Intelligence Premium May Compress, But Revenue Density Explodes</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Citrini’s most compelling argument is the philosophical one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Human intelligence will lose scarcity. That may be true, but the same can be said of human physical prowess.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What’s the issue here?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Machine intelligence is massively revenue-generative.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Coding agents increase output</p></li> <li><p>Physical AI expands robotics</p></li> <li><p>Autonomous fleets scale exponentially.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a sector-wide disruption that will inevitably make us much, much wealthier, just like the invention of the steam engine did back in the day.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Are There Any Real Threats?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, there is merit to the bear thesis, and we have to acknowledge some of its good points as mentioned during the call:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The platform will train MoE models with one-fourth the number of GPUs and reduce inference token costs by up to 10x compared to Blackwell.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A lot of the increased demand that AI is generating right now comes from the literal creation and deployment of hardware.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As AI advances, hardware needs will decrease. Yes, this would be a shock in the short term, but again, very bullish long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not only will we have AI agents that are more efficient than humans, but they will also become cheaper over time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Citrini’s 2028 memo is a useful thought experiment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But it assumes that AI is primarily labor substitution and that AI revenue does not scale with compute.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557159-nvidia-non-gaap-eps-of-1_62-beats-by-0_08-revenue-of-68_13b-beats-by-1_9b\">Nvidia’s earnings</a> prove the opposite.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As Jensen said, “Compute equals revenues.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The world is changing, but I still believe it’s for the better.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And if there is going to be some turbulence on the way, the current data does not seem to support this.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a></span>), delivered a solid, upbeat Q4, with strong sales growth across both data center and client &amp; gaming segments. AMD should continue to see<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> solid double-digit growth across its consolidated top line through FY26, with sustained hyperscalers' spending on AI infrastructure expansion and healthy enterprise adoption, which should continue to benefit demand for its GPUs over the coming quarters. But margin prospects, on the other hand, still look uncertain, primarily due to high R&amp;D spending and elevated risk from high inventory levels, which could impact gross margins negatively if there's any demand slowdown.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4854964-advanced-micro-devices-still-not-a-compelling-bet\">previous AMD article</a>, the stock has moved sideways and is down by low single-digit percentages. Although the company's outlook appears good in the near term, its competitive landscape remains challenging, particularly in the AI data center end market. In my view, this may significantly impact the company's ability to gain share in the discrete GPU market, capping its longer-term growth, particularly in the data center end market. While the stock valuation also remains expensive against its close peers, I think risk-reward remains balanced, given a challenging long-term outlook. Hence, I would like to maintain a neutral stance on the AMD stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AMD’s Q4 2025 Highlights</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earlier this month, AMD reported its final quarter results for 2025, delivering a solid <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4546637-amd-non-gaap-eps-of-1_53-beats-by-0_21-revenue-of-10_3b-beats-by-630m\">double beat in Q4</a> with healthy momentum across its key businesses. In the fourth quarter, AMD’s consolidated top line increased approximately 34.1%, reaching a record $10.27 billion. While the company’s client and gaming segment yet again reported strong double-digit growth during Q4, its data center revenue also climbed approximately 39% on solid core demand, benefitting consolidated results during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, AMD’s embedded segment was up only 3% during the quarter, as industrial and communication markets remain soft. For the full year 2025, the company’s consolidated top line reached $34.6 billion, up about 34.3% versus the prior year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720220932938101_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1564\" data-height=\"958\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720220932938101_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMD's quarterly sales\" width=\"640\" height=\"392\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720220932938101_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720220932938101_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720220932938101_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720220932938101_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AMD's quarterly sales <span>(Research Wise)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While overall volumes remain robust during the last quarter, the company’s gross margins primarily benefited from nearly $400 million in MI308 revenue from <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865498-advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">China</a>, which was previously written down. As a result, the company’s gross margins jumped approximately 290 bps to 57% in Q4. Excluding this impact, the GM would have been around 55%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, due to continued pressure from high operational expenses related to R&amp;D investments, despite strong gross margin improvement, the company’s adjusted EBITDA margin grew by just 100 bps to 29.7% in the last quarter. EBITDA growth also benefited the company’s bottom line performance, as its adjusted EPS <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD/earnings#:~:text=%241.53%20%28Beat%20by%20%240.21%29\">jumped to $1.53</a> from $1.09 a year ago, beating the consensus estimate by $0.21 in Q4 FY25.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720223107588384_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"746\" data-height=\"273\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720223107588384_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMD's Q4 2025 earnings performance versus consensus estimates\" width=\"640\" height=\"234\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720223107588384_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720223107588384_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720223107588384_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720223107588384_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AMD's Q4 2025 earnings performance <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Comments On Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Throughout FY25, AMD delivered strong double-digit growth and wrapped up the year, reporting another standout <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20386861-amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-financial-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">quarter in Q4</a> with over 34% growth across its top line, thanks to continued strength across its data center and client segments. While certain businesses remain cyclical, continued demand for AMD’s accelerator portfolio across AI infrastructure and cloud deployments should continue to support the strong momentum moving into FY26.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Data Center segment, which contributes about a 52% share in total revenue, continues to see strong demand as hyperscalers continue to expand AI infrastructure to support growing cloud and AI workloads, particularly in North America. Exiting FY25, adoption of AMD’s instinct accelerator continued to grow with increasing deployments of its MI300 GPUs across cloud and enterprise AI customers, which should continue to drive segment revenue in the quarters ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Adoption of 5th-gen EPYC processors also remains strong, continuing to drive server share gains for the company in the server CPU space. While the 5th gen now accounts for over half of total server revenue, demand for 4th gen processors also remains healthy. Hyperscaler demand across the cloud also remains solid, with over <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865498-advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">500 AMD-based instances</a> launched by AWS, Google, and others in 2025, driving the total EPYC cloud instances count to nearly 1600. While I expect this count to increase further with expanding deployment, enterprise adoption also continues to see broader penetration across large enterprises, which should further support AMD’s data center momentum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the AI software front, the company continues to expand its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865498-advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">ROCm ecosystem</a>. AMD has also introduced its enterprise suite to deliver a full-stack software platform for large-scale deployments. In my view, AMD's focus on the expansion of its software capabilities should gradually help it reduce adoption barriers over time in a market that remains dominated by Nvidia’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) CUDA ecosystem and supports higher deployments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now moving to the company’s Client &amp; Gaming segment, which contributes roughly 43% to total revenue as of Q4 (up from 35% in FY24) and has been a key growth driver for AMD revenue in 2025. Within Client, overall demand remains solid with robust demand for the company’s multiple generations of Ryzen desktop and mobile CPUs. While momentum across the commercial PC is also expected to remain healthy with growing enterprise adoption of Ryzen processors, the introduction of AMD’s<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865498-advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\"> Ryzen AI-400 mobile</a> series should further support demand in the client segment into 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The gaming business is also showing healthy momentum as demand for the company’s Radeon RX 9000 series remains robust. In my view, with competitive performance in gaming, productivity, and content creation, demand for AMD’s Ryzen portfolio should remain robust. With the integration of AI capabilities, the company should also continue to gain share in the premium PC markets. Overall, I believe, while the data center segment remains a key growth driver for AMD, contributing more than half of total revenue, the strong ongoing recovery on the client &amp; gaming side should further contribute to the consolidated growth in FY26.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the company's growth prospects remain favorable in the short term, its long-term outlook, mainly in the AI accelerator market, remains tied to its market competitiveness, particularly against Nvidia, which remains the dominant player in this space. Although AMD has significantly expanded its accelerator roadmap with higher customer engagement and its new offerings, including the MI400 series and Helio rack-scale AI platform, Nvidia remains far ahead due to its mature CUDA ecosystem and entrenched customer ties. Therefore, to sustain the current growth momentum beyond FY26, I believe strong execution, continued product competitiveness, and ecosystem depth will remain critical factors for AMD moving ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, AMD has strengthened its strategic positioning with recent collaborations, including a partnership with <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865498-advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Tata Consulting Services</a>, a global IT and consulting powerhouse, to co-develop AI solutions. This strategic collaboration is expected to meaningfully broaden AMD’s reach into enterprise AI workloads across different sectors. This partnership is expected to drive incremental adoption over the long term, supporting the company’s top line over the coming years. Additionally, the multi-year 6 GW infrastructure <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4501935-amd-surges-25-after-ai-infrastructure-deal-with-openai\">deal with OpenAI</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>) remains in place and is set to drive meaningful long-term accelerator demand, which should further benefit the company’s consolidated top line in the longer term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To sum up, near-term demand trends remain favorable, which are likely to help the company sustain double-digit top line growth through 2026. However, I think AMD's long-term outlook remains uncertain, given a highly competitive AI landscape and Nvidia’s massive scale, which doesn't look easy to get close to in the near future. Although AMD is positioned to benefit from structural AI tailwinds over the coming years, I believe sustaining accelerated growth in the long term will depend upon the company's software ecosystem development, strong execution, and, most importantly, continued competitiveness of AMD’s offerings, particularly in the data center end market.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Update: Still Unreasonable</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I initially <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4836749-amd-strong-momentum-but-risk-reward-looks-weak-ahead-of-q3\">covered the AMD stock</a> in November 2025, ahead of the company's Q3 earnings. I suggested staying on the sidelines and gave the stock a Hold rating, as its valuation appeared expensive. Since then, despite <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4514963-amd-non-gaap-eps-of-120-beats-by-003-revenue-of-925b-beats-by-500m\">double-beat results</a> in Q3 and Q4, AMD stock has remained largely sideways, significantly underperforming the market by declining approximately 17% versus a nearly 1% rise in the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>) during the same period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the stock has corrected nearly 20% since its highs near Q3 earnings, it still appears stretched. Currently, the company's stock is trading at a forward non-GAAP P/E of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD/valuation/metrics#:~:text=C%2D-,32.15,-22.41\">32.21</a>, based on its FY26 (ending Dec. 2026) consensus earnings <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD/earnings/estimates#:~:text=Dec%202026-,6.64,-59.20%25\">estimate of $6.64</a>. While the valuation still appears undervalued against its historical average multiple in the high 30s, it remains meaningfully overvalued against its closest peer, Nvidia, which is currently trading at a much lower multiple at <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/earnings/estimates#:~:text=67.33%25-,24.54,-6.17\">around 24x</a>, based on its FY27 (ending Jan. 2027) earnings estimate of $7.86, with a notably higher forward growth expectation, as can be seen in the comparison table below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720205264656432_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"783\" data-height=\"395\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720205264656432_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMD's growth comparison with NVDA\" width=\"640\" height=\"323\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720205264656432_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720205264656432_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720205264656432_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720205264656432_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AMD's growth comparison with NVDA <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going ahead, AMD's top line is expected to continue to expand in double digits, as the demand environment remains robust across its core segments. However, the company's margin trajectory remains relatively uncertain. Although the company reported solid margin growth in Q4, most of the improvement was driven by the release of MI300 series accelerators' inventory to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865498-advanced-micro-devices-inc-amd-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">China</a> during the quarter, which was previously written off and may not be present in subsequent quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, as of Q4, AMD's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20386861-amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-financial-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A10\">inventory levels</a> are at around $7.9 billion (77% of Q4 sales). While demand visibility appears strong, current inventory levels appear overbuilt, which might increase the risk for potential write-downs in the short term if there's any setback with slowing hyperscalers or slipping ramps. This is notable when compared with Nvidia, which is operating with a significantly more linear inventory profile. Although Q4 benefited from certain reversals, the present inventory levels also introduce downside risk to gross margins in the coming quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720213951410801.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMD's inventory levels\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"600\" height=\"371\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720213951410801.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720213951410801.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59815527-17720213951410801.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AMD's inventory levels <span>(Q4 2025 earnings release)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apart from these, AMD also continues to invest significantly in R&amp;D to expand and enhance its portfolio. While these investments are important to stay competitive in the evolving AI landscape, they are likely to remain a headwind for the company's operating margins in FY26, further limiting the pace of the company's bottom line expansion despite robust top line growth. With continued margin uncertainty and intense competition, I believe AMD's premium valuation is difficult to justify, limiting the upside in the near term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Verdict And Rating</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As discussed above, the company's stock is still trading at a slight premium despite the recent correction. While the company's topline outlook looks favorable with a robust demand environment, margins should be under pressure in the short term, primarily due to high R&amp;D investments. At present, AMD's valuation still appears to embed high expectations for share gains and margin growth. While the company may continue to deliver steady growth over the coming quarter, given the intense competitive dynamics and margin uncertainty, I think the risk-reward stays unattractive, and the stock may continue to underperform. Therefore, I am maintaining a Hold rating on AMD stock for now.</p>",

With monthly paying funds (and even some weekly paying ETFs<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> these days), that isn't too difficult. However, there are a lot of choices that can be quite aggressive in terms of risk, either by adding leverage or going into relatively riskier investments.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that, we want to highlight a couple of opportunities that provide monthly distributions to their investors. However, funds that are also relatively more conservative in their investment strategies have more defensive underlying exposure.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">#1 BlackRock Health Sciences Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BME\" title=\"BlackRock Health Sciences Trust\">BME</a>)</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>1-Year Z-score: 3.03</li> <li>Discount/Premium: -4.36%</li> <li>Distribution Yield: 7.50%</li> <li>Expense Ratio: 1.11%</li> <li>Leverage: N/A</li> <li>Managed Assets: $566 million</li> <li>Structure: Perpetual</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>BlackRock had announced <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/literature/press-release/9-10-2025-pr-fe-cef-inv-obj-and-options-update.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener noopener\">in late 2025</a> that several funds would be removing their options writing focus, no longer being call writing funds, and BME was one of those. With that, there has been a slight tweak in the wording of its investment objective.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund's <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/240227/blackrock-health-sciences-trust-usd-fund\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener noopener\">investment objective</a> is now \"to provide total return and income primarily through long-term capital appreciation.\" In an attempt to achieve that, they will \"invest, under normal market conditions, at least 80% of its assets in equity securities of companies engaged in the health sciences and related industries and equity derivatives with exposure to the health sciences industry.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BME has been a name we've liked for a long time, after the healthcare sector has been out of favor, and the fund has seen itself drop to a deep discount. Well, the healthcare space has been finding its footing and starting to rebound—as has BME's discount started to narrow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that, it may not be the best deal that it was a year ago or even several months ago, but it still gets a 'Buy' rating from us. In the short term, it is looking relatively extended in terms of valuation, but on the other hand, it still remains trading below its longer-term average discount level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/saupload_235f1b9feb5112926f4cc49fdc72d8f6.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"424\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/saupload_235f1b9feb5112926f4cc49fdc72d8f6.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/saupload_235f1b9feb5112926f4cc49fdc72d8f6.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/saupload_235f1b9feb5112926f4cc49fdc72d8f6.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ycharts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In general, the combination of no leverage and healthcare exposure makes this fund an overall more defensive one in the closed-end fund space. While there is some risk in individual names within the healthcare space, as there can be with any specific sector, diversification with investments spread across ~160 holdings helps to limit its overall negative impact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, UnitedHealth Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNH\" title=\"UnitedHealth Group Incorporated\">UNH</a>) is a name that can't seem to avoid negative news for the last year, and it has been tumbling as it is down nearly 50%. This is a position for BME, but it hasn't completely derailed the CEF, and the fund has delivered ~9% total NAV returns over the last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/1058901-17709002477680619_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BME Top Ten Holdings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"206\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/1058901-17709002477680619_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/1058901-17709002477680619_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/1058901-17709002477680619_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/1058901-17709002477680619_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">BME Top Ten Holdings <span>(BlackRock)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">#2 NEOS Gold High Income ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IAUI\" title=\"NEOS Gold High Income ETF\">IAUI</a>)</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Dividend Frequency: Monthly</li> <li>Dividend Yield: 1.88% SEC yield, 12.25% Distribution Yield</li> <li>Expense Ratio: 0.78%</li> <li>Leverage: N/A</li> <li>Managed Assets: $367.7 million</li> <li>Structure: Active ETF</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IAUI's<a href=\"https://neosfunds.com/iaui/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> investment objective</a> is to \"generate high monthly income with the potential for appreciation based on exposure to exchange-traded products (\"ETPs\") that have direct exposure to gold.\" To achieve this, the fund will utilize a \"data-driven call option strategy on gold ETPs.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund has seen considerable interest since launching. When we initially covered the name in August 2025, it was at less than $30 million AUM. Today, that has pushed close to almost $368 million. NEOS Investments launched only in mid-2022. However, the fund sponsor has quickly made a name for itself in the ETF space for launching funds that income investors can rely on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund's strategy is fairly simple, and that is sometimes a good thing. Complexity for the sake of complexity can sometimes simply cause higher risk. For IAUI, they invest in gold ETFs and create synthetic long positions through options; this is then hedged with U.S. Treasury Bill holdings. The more active part is using a laddered approach to partially overwrite to generate option premiums.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/1058901-17709008845338397_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IAUI Holdings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"286\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/1058901-17709008845338397_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/1058901-17709008845338397_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/1058901-17709008845338397_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/1058901-17709008845338397_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IAUI Holdings <span>(NEOS)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I know options can be fairly complex for some investors, but the type of options we are talking about here are some of the most straightforward vanilla types. At present, the fund is roughly ~51% overwritten from the 2/12/2026 holdings. This partial overwrite and laddered approach benefits the fund in that it can participate in a lot of upside if gold continues to run higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By generating option premiums through writing calls, this provides the 'income' component to pay out a monthly distribution to investors. The big difference between the SEC yield and the distribution rate is that the yield component only reflects the U.S. Treasury Bill interest being earned minus the expenses. Since the fund is using capital gains from the options writing strategy or appreciation from gold rising, the actual distribution rate is significantly higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/1058901-17709013100749304_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IAUI Distribution History\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"222\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/1058901-17709013100749304_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/1058901-17709013100749304_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/1058901-17709013100749304_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/1058901-17709013100749304_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IAUI Distribution History <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">No doubt, gold has been on a monster run, and an investor could have a right to be skeptical about investing here, at least aggressively. However, I think that IAUI can still be a solid investment choice over the long term, as gold is likely never to stop having value. It is something tangible that can be used and/or often hoarded as a store of value. A true safe haven asset during periods of significant uncertainty and volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, as we were looking at another fund recently, the Strategy Shares Gold Enhanced Yield ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOLY\" title=\"Strategy Shares Gold Enhanced Yield ETF\">GOLY</a>), we noted that during the latest pullback for gold, IAUI held up relatively well. Albeit in a relatively short period of time, it still resulted in losses during that period, but it was about a quarter of what the iShares Gold Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IAU\" title=\"iShares Gold Trust ETF\">IAU</a>) actually dropped.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at it now since gold's peak on Jan. 29, 2026, it is the only fund that has posted positive returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/saupload_e5640a9224f9a7983b69ce5fd463c176.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"524\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/saupload_e5640a9224f9a7983b69ce5fd463c176.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/saupload_e5640a9224f9a7983b69ce5fd463c176.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/saupload_e5640a9224f9a7983b69ce5fd463c176.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCharts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, this is a relatively short period, but it helps to at least start to show a track record of relative defensiveness compared to its peers and IAU itself. There is no guarantee that it can continue to be so defensive, but given the underlying safe haven exposure to gold and slightly defensive strategy of call writing, it is safe to say that this fund fits the category of a relatively conservative investment for the long term.</p>",
