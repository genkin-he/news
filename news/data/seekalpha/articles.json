We'll note that longer-term performance comparisons favor the fund over the benchmark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">U.S. small-cap stocks posted a gain in the fourth quarter, according to the benchmark, extending a rebound that began in early April, but at a slower pace. The advance was supported by strong corporate fundamentals, a resilient economy, an ongoing boom in spending on artificial intelligence and the Federal Reserve's first interest-rate reductions since December 2024. Within the Russell 2000® Index, small-cap value stocks (+3.26%) modestly outpaced small-cap growth (+1.22%) in Q4. Large-caps, as represented by the Russell Top 200 Index (+2.99%), had a slight advantage over small-caps in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Only three of 11 sectors outpaced the small-cap-oriented Russell 2000® Index. Health care (+19%) had the strongest outcome and particularly shined in November. Materials (+5%) also posted a solid gain, while the growth-oriented communication services sector rose about 4%, benefiting from the transformative potential of generative AI. Conversely, the defensive-oriented consumer staples sector (-5%) lagged, as did information technology (-5%) consumer discretionary (-4%) and industrials (-2%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Industry positioning detracted from the fund's performance versus the benchmark, especially in health care. A non-benchmark position in industrial technology company Crane NXT (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CXT\" title=\"Crane NXT, Co.\">CXT</a>) (-30%) was the largest individual relative detractor. Shares of Crane NXT hit an all-time high in October. However, as the Trump administration threatened to levy steep trade tariffs on Chinese imports, reigniting fears of a trade war, shares of Crane NXT slid downward through year end. Aggressive U.S. trade policies threatened many companies exposed to the industrials sector, as costs become unpredictable and can disrupt manufacturing operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In contrast, a non-benchmark stake in micro-chip manufacturer Micron Technology (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU\" title=\"Micron Technology, Inc.\">MU</a>) (+72%) was the top individual relative contributor. Shares of the company have soared since hitting a low on April 4, 2025. The company is only one of three that specialize in high-bandwidth memory, which is increasingly in demand as technology driven by artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent. During the past year, Micron Technology's revenue, as well as its cash flow, have dramatically increased due in large part to brisk demand for its chips. As Micron Technology's stock approached our target valuation this quarter, we trimmed the fund's position to invest in other investment opportunities. </p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio Positioning and Market Outlook</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund's positioning among sectors remained largely unchanged the past three months, as we made only modest shifts based on where we found the best potential risk-adjusted returns and opportunistic ideas that fit our investment philosophy. Our investment process centers on being patient, taking a long-term view and comparing price to value with the hope of choosing undiscovered gems. When we evaluate a stock, we typically think about owning it for three to five years, looking past short-term noise and focusing on key fundamental drivers over a multiyear period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As 2026 begins, we continue to find many investments outside the U.S. to be attractive, given the valuation gap that exists following an extended period of significant U.S. equity outperformance. That said, in the U.S., we are finding some interesting opportunities in areas where prices have been dislocated due to revised tariffs and tariff policy uncertainty. We are focusing on companies that we believe will successfully adapt to a \"new normal,\" and where the market is pricing in a much more pessimistic outlook. In addition to identifying companies that don't trade at an excessive valuation, we seek those that consistently generate positive cash flow. When the market is narrow and favors only a few winners, we believe it helps us find compelling ideas that are overlooked, and thus provides opportunity for investment. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">References</h4> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Life of Fund ('LOF') if performance is less than 10 years.

It focuses mostly on small- and mid-cap companies, including overseas. Most holdings have share prices below $35 per share or an earnings yield at or above the median for the Russell 2000® Index. (The earnings yield is the inverse of the price-earnings (P/E) ratio; a high earnings yield means a low P/E ratio.)</p> <p>Our investment process is based on the belief that many low-priced stocks are mispriced. Mispricings are especially likely to occur in businesses that seem boring and out of favor or which require careful analysis.</p> <p>We seek to buy higher-quality companies with stable growth prospects that trade at a discount to our estimate of intrinsic (fair) value.</p> <p>Where the gap between price and value is especially compelling, we may invest in firms whose near-term prospects appear challenged. We cast a wide net, and many holdings are outside of the fund's benchmark.</p> <p>We invest with a long-term time horizon and global perspective, seeking to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns. To help manage risk, we look for understandable businesses that are resilient and growing, with honest and capable management, purchased at a modest price.</p> <p>Performance Summary</p> <div class=\"table-responsive\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead> <tr> <th></th> <th>Cumulative</th> <th>Annualized</th> </tr> <tr> <th>3 Month</th> <th>YTD</th> <th>1 Year</th> <th>3 Year</th> <th>5 Year</th> <th>10 Year/ LOF 1</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund</td> <td>1.64%</td> <td>14.77%</td> <td>14.77%</td> <td>12.02%</td> <td>10.52%</td> <td>10.25%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gross Expense Ratio: 0.87% 2</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Russell 2000 Index</td> <td>2.19%</td> <td>12.81%</td> <td>12.81%</td> <td>13.73%</td> <td>6.09%</td> <td>9.62%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Morningstar Fund Global Small/Mid Stock</td> <td>0.97%</td> <td>16.34%</td> <td>16.34%</td> <td>10.19%</td> <td>2.88%</td> <td>7.34%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>% Rank in Morningstar Category (1% = Best)</td> <td>--</td> <td>--</td> <td>47%</td> <td>42%</td> <td>12%</td> <td>8%</td> </tr> <tr> <td># of Funds in Morningstar Category</td> <td>--</td> <td>--</td> <td>177</td> <td>166</td> <td>150</td> <td>90</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p>1 Life of Fund ('LOF') if performance is less than 10 years.

A positive number represents an overweight, and a negative number is an underweight. The fund's benchmark is listed immediately under the fund name in the Performance Summary.</p> <p>3-Year Risk/return Statistics</p> <p>Beta is a measure of the volatility of a fund relative to its benchmark index. A beta greater (le<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/S\" title=\"SentinelOne, Inc.\">S</a>s) than 1 is more (le<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/S\" title=\"SentinelOne, Inc.\">S</a>s) volatile than the index.</p> <p>Information Ratio measures a fund's active return (fund's average monthly return minus the benchmark's average monthly return) in relation to the volatility of its active returns.</p> <p>R-Squared measures how a fund's performance correlates with a benchmark index's performance and shows what portion of it can be explained by the performance of the overall market/index. R-Squared ranges from 0, meaning no correlation, to 1, meaning perfect correlation. An R-Squared value of less than 0.5 indicates that annualized alpha and beta are not reliable performance statistics.</p> <p>Sharpe Ratio is a measure of historical risk-adjusted performance. It is calculated by dividing the fund's excess returns (the fund's average annual return for the period minus the 3-month \"risk free\" return rate) and dividing it by the standard deviation of the fund's returns. The higher the ratio, the better the fund's return per unit of risk. The three month \"risk free\" rate used is the 90-day Treasury Bill rate.</p> <p>Standard Deviation is a statistical measurement of the dispersion of a fund's return over a specified time period. Fidelity calculates standard deviations by comparing a fund's monthly returns to its average monthly return over a 36-month period, and then annualizes the number. Investors may examine historical standard deviation in conjunction with historical returns to decide whether a fund's volatility would have been acceptable given the returns it would have produced. A higher standard deviation indicates a wider dispersion of past returns and thus greater historical volatility. Standard deviation does not indicate how the fund actually performed, but merely indicates the volatility of its returns over time.</p> <p>Tracking Error is the divergence between the price behavior of a position or a portfolio and the price behavior of a benchmark, creating an unexpected profit or loss.</p> <p><em>Before investing in any mutual fund, please carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses.

The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) enacted two quarter-point interest rate cuts, bringing the total reduction for the year to three-quarters of a percentage point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, corporate earnings again outpaced market expectations. Although volatility was limited for the market, individual stocks saw significant divergence in performance, creating what we saw as a very favorable environment for security selection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We expect Q4 earnings to remain strong, especially given robust holiday spending, while equity valuations appear elevated. We also anticipate increased volatility in the coming year, particularly in light of ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, the upcoming U.S. midterm elections, and divergent central bank policies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We expect the Fed to maintain a cautious approach, and for fixed-income volatility to increase as investors navigate uncertainty regarding the future path of Fed policy. Although short-term yields declined in 2025, we believe that elevated longer-term yields could provide an attractive investment. In addition, credit fundamentals remain stable.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Contributors and detractors</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund's equity portfolio outperformed due to strong security selection, particularly in the communication services sector. Stock picking and sector allocation—the latter of which derived from the fund's bottom-up security selection process—in healthcare also contributed. Security selection in consumer staples and real estate modestly detracted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Individually, Eli Lilly &amp; Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY\" title=\"Eli Lilly and Company\">LLY</a>) contributed to relative performance. Shares of the pharmaceutical company rose amid continued growth in its GLP-1 drug franchise. Also contributing was Freeport-McMoRan, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCX\" title=\"Freeport-McMoRan Inc.\">FCX</a>), a mining company that benefited from rising copper and gold prices. Alphabet, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) further lifted the fund's relative performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In contrast, Zebra Technologies Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZBRA\" title=\"Zebra Technologies Corporation\">ZBRA</a>) detracted. The developer of bar-code technologies produced solid quarterly earnings that nevertheless appeared to lag investor expectations. Also hampering the fund's result was BellRing Brands, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRBR\" title=\"BellRing Brands, Inc.\">BRBR</a>), a maker of protein shakes. In Q4, its stock fell amid broadening concerns about heightened competition. Further detracting was the fund's lack of exposure to Apple, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), a large benchmark component that modestly outperformed the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the fixed-income portfolio, which outperformed, the main contributors were an underweight in U.S. Treasuries and an overweight in mortgage-backed securities. However, overweights in high-yield bonds and asset-backed securities detracted from performance.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio changes</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund's equity and fixed-income allocations finished 2025 at about 58% and 42%, respectively, little changed from September 30. Within the quarter, however, the fund's stock allocation rose with the market's outperformance, leading us to reduce the portfolio's equity allocation to maintain our desired underweight.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We established 7 new equity positions and sold 3 stocks from the fund. Turnover moderated but remained higher than usual, reflecting our active repositioning to take advantage of stock-level opportunities created by market volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the fixed-income portfolio, we added to the fund's securitized credit, primarily through purchases of non-agency residential MBS and non-traditional subsectors of the ABS market. In contrast, we reduced the fund's allocations to investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">References</h4> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>It is not possible to invest in an index.

Fixed-income investments are subject to interest-rate and credit risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise or if an issuer is unable or unwilling to make principal or interest payments. Investments in higher-yielding, lower-rated securities include a higher risk of default. Foreign investing, especially in emerging markets, has additional risks, such as currency and market volatility and political and social instability. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities may be sensitive to changes in interest rates, and may be subject to early repayment and the market's perception of issuer creditworthiness. Liquidity—the extent to which a security may be sold or a derivative position closed without negatively affecting its market value, if at all—may be impaired by reduced trading volume, heightened volatility, rising interest rates, and other market conditions. The use of hedging and derivatives could produce disproportionate gains or losses and may increase costs. Active and frequent trading of securities can increase transaction costs (lowering performance) and taxable distributions. Please see the fund's prospectus for additional risks.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 Index tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index tracks the performance of U.S. investment-grade bonds in government, asset-backed, and corporate debt markets.

For example, SCHD's Industrials weighting was recently 12.1%, while the S&amp;P 500's Industrials sector is only around 8.3%. Also, SCHD's focus on high-quality dividend payers often favors stable, established industrial and manufacturing firms (e.g., holdings like Lockheed Martin, Home Depot, and various machinery/transportation names), giving it a relative overweight in this area compared to the tech-heavy S&amp;P 500.</li> <li><p><strong>Domestic Revenues</strong>: SCHD also has higher <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SCHD/comments/1jsj5cq/73_of_revenue_comes_from_the_us_for_schd_vs_60/\" rel=\"nofollow\">exposure</a> to US (domestic) revenues in general as compared to the S&amp;P 500. This is because SCHD consists entirely of US-listed companies (screened for consistent dividend payments and quality), which tend to derive a larger portion of their revenues from the domestic US market due to its value-oriented, defensive, and industrials-heavy tilt. In contrast, the S&amp;P 500 has significant international revenue exposure, historically around 40%+, driven by its heavy weighting in global tech giants like Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), and Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) that generate substantial earnings abroad.</p></li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Macro Factor 2</strong>: The Fed’s Great Unwind is only just Beginning</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The decade-plus dominance of US growth stock performance has recently started to shift as value-oriented strategies (such as SCHD) are recently the leading performers (see chart below).

The balance sheet grew as part of extraordinarily stimulative monetary policies (which also included near-zero interest rates) designed to revive the economy from its near-death “Great Financial Crisis” in ‘08-’09 (and again following the covid shutdowns).

Specifically, the strength of the US dollar (or lack thereof) is another reason why US-domiciled global big-tech companies are underperforming recently and why non-US stocks have been a relative outperformer for US dollar-denominated investors. More specifically, growing concerns about the dollar since the US fully ditched the gold standard, have accelerated post-GFC (and even more post-COVID) as both fiscal and monetary stimulus, now combined with “trade wars,” are leading investors to question the dollar’s global-reserve-currency status (the US government lost its “AAA” credit rating) and pushing them to invest in alternatives such as gold. This slow-moving but accelerating megatrend shift (with lots of noise) is another factor that should be baked into investment decisions (more on this later).</p></li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_1.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Econovist\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"568\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_1.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_1.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_1.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Econovist</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>3 Easy-Alpha Strategies</strong>: To Win with SCHD</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So with those two macroeconomic megatrend factors brewing in the background (i.e. Trump’s “America First” economics and the broader US government’s disregard for the integrity of the US dollar), let’s consider their short- and long-term impacts on SCHD (in the risks section), as well as specific investment strategies to generate alpha and win big with SCHD in particular.</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p><strong>Qualified Dividends</strong>: Depending on your tax bracket, and whether you own SCHD in a taxable or non-taxable account, is one of the most straightforward ways to add alpha (defined as the excess return of an investment relative to a benchmark). Especially when you consider SCHD’s total return potential (price appreciation plus growing dividends reinvested) as compared to other popular \"higher yielding\" investments that often pay non-qualified dividends (sometimes more appropriately described as \"distributions\"), especially considering they frequently destroy their own share prices just to maintain those glittery big distributions that yield chasers love (I share a bunch of examples <a href=\"https://www.blueharbinger.com/cef\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>). For most investors (but certainly not all), qualified dividends are often taxed at 15%—lower than their marginal tax rate. And when you combine SCHD’s focus on qualified dividends with its focus on long-term capital appreciation (also often taxed at 15%—long-term capital gains tax rate for many investors and again lower than most investors marginal income tax rate), SCHD can be pretty darned attractive as compared to the unqualified, capital-destroying (often via return-of-capital-sourced distributions) sparkly high yields that often get way more attention than they’re worth. If peers are your benchmark—SCHD’s long-term alpha potential is attractive.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Owning SCHD in an IRA</strong>—Depending on your personal situation, it can make sense to own SCHD in an Individual Retirement Account (\"IRA\") whereby dividends are taxed at 0% (versus often at 15% if you own it in a taxable account). Of course, there is a whole science behind whether or not to own SCHD inside or outside of an IRA (the answer depends in large part on how aggressive SCHD is relative to your other investments). But if you want to outperform your peer benchmark, owning SCHD in a tax-advantaged IRA is a quick way to add alpha (it's called \"asset location\" and it can add up to 0.60% of alpha, according to this popular Vanguard <a href=\"https://advisors.vanguard.com/content/dam/fas/pdfs/IARCQAA.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a>).</p></li> <li><p><strong>A Quasi-Bond Substitute in your Risk Budget</strong>: A lot of investors long for the days of the early 1980s when a 10-year US treasury bond offered a 15%+ annual yield and the US government still had its AAA credit rating. Alas, today we’re stuck with lower yields and higher risks on treasuries, while the stock market is way too volatile for many investors’ tastes. But rather than allocating your investments to a traditional 60/40 strategy (i.e. 60% stocks and 40% bonds) you might consider SCHD as a quasi-bond substitute (it does yield 3.3%—almost as much as that massive Vanguard Bond strategy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BND\" title=\"Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund ETF\">BND</a>) that lands in almost every target date fund they sell), plus SCHD has more long-term price appreciation potential.</p></li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/42083106-17720552582891245_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1870\" data-height=\"1071\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/42083106-17720552582891245_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"JP Morgan\" width=\"640\" height=\"367\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/42083106-17720552582891245_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/42083106-17720552582891245_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/42083106-17720552582891245_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/42083106-17720552582891245_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Guide to the Markets <span>(JP Morgan)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like treasury bonds, SCHD can be a \"flight to quality\" investment during times of market distress, exhibiting lower beta and lower price drawdowns as compared to the S&amp;P 500 (thanks to the high-quality blue-chip businesses it owns). And some investors comfortably outperform a 60/40 benchmark strategy by increasing their stock allocation (perhaps to say 70%) but with SCHD—a strategy they view as more attractive than investing in the full S&amp;P 500 (which includes a massive allocation to volatile growth stocks). In this sense, SCHD can be a quasi-bond alpha-generating allocation strategy within their overall risk budget.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Risks</strong>:</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Macroeconomic Sensitivity</strong>: As described earlier, SCHD has benefited from recent macroeconomic factors (such as Trump’s tariff impacts and the fed’s monetary policies), but just as quickly as these factors have benefited SCHD recently, they can create headwinds if the economic environment changes significantly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Structural Underperformance vs. Growth-Oriented Investments</strong>: The <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/dividends-factors/dow-jones-us-dividend-100-index/#overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">index </a>upon which SCHD is based has strict rules (10-year dividend history + quality screens like cash flow to debt and ROE requirements) systematically excludes or underweights high-growth companies that don't pay dividends or have shorter histories. This has caused notable lagging vs. the S&amp;P 500 in growth-driven periods, especially since 2022 and in 2025. While SCHD can shine in value rotations (e.g. the strong start to 2026), it often misses big upside in tech/AI rallies. The opportunity cost of investing in SCHD has been very real. And if you want to pair it with a few growth stocks (for risk management reasons), consider my recent article: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4862619-alphabet-big-rally-ranking-the-magnificent-7\">Ranking the Mag 7</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Heavy Sector Concentration</strong> is another risk. For example, SCHD has a big overweight to energy stocks (see graphic below) as compared to the S&amp;P 500 (where energy is only 3.7%). And this concentration can cause the fund to underperform the market at various points in the market cycle. Also worth mentioning, SCHD has little direct exposure to real estate, as REITs for example, often don’t pay the pure qualified dividends that SCHD focuses on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/42083106-17719129989801726_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2000\" data-height=\"762\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/42083106-17719129989801726_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SCHD Fact Sheet\" width=\"640\" height=\"244\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/42083106-17719129989801726_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/42083106-17719129989801726_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/42083106-17719129989801726_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/42083106-17719129989801726_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SCHD Fact Sheet</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Interest Rate Sensitivity</strong>: High-dividend yield stocks often act like bond proxies whereby rising rates (or expectations thereof) can pressure valuations as investors shift to safer fixed-income alternatives.

In the below graph from the St. Louis Fed, you can see that rates are still near the top of their 5-year chart, and the administration has emphasized numerous times that they would like to continue seeing rates lowered.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673654268_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1333\" data-height=\"724\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673654268_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"30 year fixed mortgage rate\" width=\"640\" height=\"348\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673654268_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673654268_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673654268_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673654268_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FRED</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We believe that this ultimately will help to provide a boost for technology firms, as typically these companies thrive in low rate environments, where they can bring on debt to fund growth. This should be a bullish factor for technology companies, as long as they do not saddle on too much debt where their cash flows are unable to meet servicing requirements.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The US Government Remains Bullish on Technology</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current administration has stated numerous times that they are <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/eliminating-state-law-obstruction-of-national-artificial-intelligence-policy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">bullish</a> on AI in the future, and the administration has also emphasized that they desire the US to be the center of innovation and tech in the future. The government is also currently in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-eyes-pentagon-ai-program-trade-blocks-minerals-pricing-sources-say-2026-02-24/\" rel=\"nofollow\">conversations</a> about implementing large amounts of AI into their systems, and should continue to prove to be a tailwind for technology companies moving forward. This administration has also pushed for increased <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/24/trump-to-announce-data-center-energy-deals-during-state-of-the-union-00794834\" rel=\"nofollow\">energy output</a> to serve AI needs, and this should also help to serve as a floor for AI firms in general.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Strategy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund employs a synthetic covered call strategy on NDX. A standard covered call strategy would involve purchasing the underlying equity (in this case, NDX) and then selling call options against that equity. In this case, the fund uses a “synthetic” strategy, meaning that instead of buying NDX outright, they purchase options in a manner that yields similar returns to owning NDX. For the purposes of this analysis, we will assume that the fund just purchases NDX directly, as the returns generally work out to be the same.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below is a chart that compares the covered call strategy with a strategy where you just buy the underlying equity without selling covered calls. We used the following scenario for this chart:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Buy 100 shares of NDX at $100</p></li> <li><p>Sell a covered call at a $110 strike for a premium of $200</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673340995_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1730\" data-height=\"1000\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673340995_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Covered Call Strategy\" width=\"640\" height=\"370\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673340995_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673340995_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673340995_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673340995_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Doodad Capital</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We see that the covered call strategy (blue line) can be better if the price of NDX declines or only increases by a modest amount. If the price of NDX increases above a certain threshold, your gains from the covered call strategy are capped (hence why the blue line flattens out).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This means that generally, when you invest in a covered call strategy, you are predicting that the price of the underlying equity will decrease or only increase by a little. If you think the price of the equity will increase more dramatically, then the covered call strategy is not for you.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s look at the performance of QDTE vs QQQ over the last year. QQQ is a Nasdaq-100 index ETF so it will yield the same performance as NDX. We do not use NDX here, as it is just an index and not a purchasable equity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764672784817_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1300\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764672784817_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"QDTE vs QQQ\" width=\"640\" height=\"222\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764672784817_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764672784817_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764672784817_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764672784817_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We see that both options had a very similar return. Although QDTE had better returns by 10 basis points, for most of the period QQQ had higher returns than QDTE. This is not a good sign for QDTE at all. For all of the extra effort to trade synthetic options and covered calls, the fund has only returned 0.10% more than if you just bought QQQ. Additionally, QDTE has an expense ratio of 0.97%, which is 5.39x larger than QQQ’s expense ratio of 0.18%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the future, we may see QDTE outperform QQQ if the positive movement of QQQ slows down or possibly goes negative. However, if you are predicting that scenario to occur, you are probably better off not owning either QDTE or QQQ.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To recap, if you bought QQQ instead of QDTE:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>You would have 5.39x cost savings in expense ratios</p></li> <li><p>You have no risk of gains being capped by covered calls</p></li> <li><p>BUT historically you would have missed out on 0.10% in returns over the last year</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sounds like a good deal to us.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Tariff Conversations are Back at the Forefront</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6zn3ly22yo\" rel=\"nofollow\">new global tariffs of 10%</a> (with potential promises of 15%) being implemented, there could be an impact on the overall economy and returns for NDX. If NDX does indeed decline in value (or at least not increase significantly), then a covered call strategy could prove to be a better choice.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If this risk occurs, QDTE may slightly retreat a bit but will still pay out income to investors.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>AI Might Disrupt More Industries and Cause More Volatility</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we have seen with various AI announcements, such as <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4549697-wealth-management-and-tax-prep-stocks-sink-as-altruist-launches-new-ai-tool\">Altruist</a> launching a wealth management tool and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/23/cybersecurity-stocks-anthropic-ai-crowdstrike.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anthropic</a> launching a cybersecurity tool, there remain lots of disruption events in the field of technology. This can cause stocks to react negatively to the news, and this might cause near-term negative swings and volatility in the underlying index.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For short-term swings on AI risks, QDTE will experience less volatility than QQQ, for instance, and will still be able to pay distributions to investors for income.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Technology companies as an investment are facing an era where growth should be strong and investments across public and private sectors should be tremendous. There is significant innovation and development occurring in the AI and tech sectors, and the underlying companies of the Nasdaq 100 should benefit from these tailwinds. We believe tech companies are a fantastic place for growth capital for the long run.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, QDTE is simply the wrong path to go down. If you are bullish on NDX and big tech like we are, we recommend a non-covered call strategy (like QQQ) where your returns are not capped. We saw in the historical comparison that QDTE has provided no real marginal value to investors compared to a simple buy-and-hold strategy on NDX. We advise you to not burn any unnecessary calories nor pay any unnecessary fees and just buy a standard, cheap, big tech ETF.</p>",

The goal of these meetings is to settle long-term concerns over Iran's nuclear program and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to prevent the US from launching new military strikes. This is happening at a tense time, as the US has been significantly increasing its military presence in the Middle East.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On Thursday, the two sides met in Switzerland for two separate sessions (one in the morning and one in the afternoon). However, they didn't speak directly; instead, officials from Oman acted as go-betweens, passing messages back and forth between:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Iran's side:</strong> Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The U.S. side:</strong> Envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before the talks ended, a high-ranking Iranian official told Reuters that a basic deal is possible but only if the US stops mixing nuclear arguments with other, unrelated disagreements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We finally heard from the Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi a short while ago, who stated, \"Today was one of the best, most serious &amp; longest rounds of negotiations. We made good progress &amp; seriously engaged with elements of a deal regarding both #nuclear &amp; sanctions issues. We are close to an understanding on some issues, though differences remain on others.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The developments have also been having a massive impact on oil prices as well as haven demand, as it is another layer of uncertainty for market participants to consider.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What happens next?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Consultations:</strong> Officials from both countries are heading back to their capitals to discuss the progress.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Future Meetings:</strong> Formal negotiations will start again soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Technical Talks:</strong> Experts are scheduled to meet in Vienna next week to work on the specific details.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi shared the update on X (formerly Twitter) after the most recent round of talks in Switzerland ended.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall risk sentiment does not appear to have been affected that much, with AI still the dominant theme, especially for equity markets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why did oil prices jump then fall?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to the oil market, one that has been affected by the US military buildup in the Middle East, prices were largely flat after some whipsaw price action earlier in the day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Prices actually spiked by more than a dollar earlier in the day. This happened because reports suggested the talks had hit a wall. Specifically, the U.S. was reportedly demanding two things that Iran didn't like:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>That Iran stop all uranium enrichment.</li> <li>That Iran hand over all its highly enriched uranium to the U.S.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, once Oman announced that \"significant progress\" was actually being made, prices dropped back down and lost most of those gains. Market participants are laser-focused on these talks. Here are the basic rules they are likely following right now:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>If talks fail: </strong>Traders worry about war or supply problems in the Middle East, which makes oil more expensive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>If talks succeed:</strong> The risk of conflict goes down, which causes a sell-off and lowers prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, though, key support rests at the 62.66 handle (200-day MA) before the 61.67 and the 100-day MA 60.27 come into focus. A move higher from here in oil prices faces a test at the 66.15 handle before the 67.00 handle comes into play.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>WTI Crude Oil Daily Chart, February 26, 2026</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_USOIL_2026-02-26_20-18-40.width-1400.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1400\" data-height=\"814\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_USOIL_2026-02-26_20-18-40.width-1400.png?io=w640\" alt=\"WTI Crude Oil Daily Chart, February 26, 2026\" width=\"1280\" height=\"744\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_USOIL_2026-02-26_20-18-40.width-1400.png?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_USOIL_2026-02-26_20-18-40.width-1400.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_USOIL_2026-02-26_20-18-40.width-1400.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_USOIL_2026-02-26_20-18-40.width-1400.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_USOIL_2026-02-26_20-18-40.width-1400.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_USOIL_2026-02-26_20-18-40.width-1400.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_USOIL_2026-02-26_20-18-40.width-1400.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source:Tradingview</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><a href=\"https://www.marketpulse.com/markets/us-iran-talks-advance-iranian-fm-confirms-progress-on-nuclear-and-sanctions-issues-oil-prices-steady/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Original Post</a></em></p>",

Central banks are still buying</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Official sector demand remains the backbone of the gold market. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, central banks, particularly across emerging markets, have accelerated reserve diversification in response to sanctions risk, geopolitical fragmentation and a desire to reduce reliance on the US dollar. Crucially, this demand has proved steady and largely price insensitive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Poland, the world’s largest reported gold buyer last year, has signalled further purchases as it targets a higher absolute level of gold holdings rather than a fixed share of reserves. It is now targeting around 700 tonnes of gold, up from roughly 550 tonnes, rather than a fixed 30% share of reserves. This underscores that reserve accumulation remains strategic, not tactical.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China’s central bank also extended its gold buying to a fifteenth month in January. As long as geopolitical fragmentation persists, a meaningful reversal in central bank gold demand looks unlikely. This structural floor continues to underpin the market at elevated price levels.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Central bank demand remains resilient</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721528817873054_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"744\" data-height=\"343\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721528817873054_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Central bank demand remains resilient\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"295\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721528817873054_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721528817873054_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721528817873054_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721528817873054_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: World Gold Council, ING Research</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. Geopolitics back to the forefront</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Geopolitical risk has re-emerged as a dominant macro driver. From renewed Middle East tensions to trade frictions and tariff threats, investors are navigating a more uncertain global environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Policy unpredictability, particularly around trade, is increasing volatility across asset classes. Against this backdrop, safe-haven demand remains well supported. Gold’s role as a hedge against geopolitical and policy shocks is once again in focus.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. Fed easing could add a tailwind</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A shift in the US monetary policy backdrop could provide an additional tailwind for gold. While the Federal Reserve remains cautious, the balance of risks is gradually tilting towards easing as growth momentum cools and inflation continues to normalise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our US economist expects the Fed to begin cutting rates in the second quarter, with policy becoming incrementally less restrictive over the coming quarters. Even a modest easing cycle would be supportive for gold, lowering real yields and reducing the opportunity cost of holding non‑yielding assets.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">4. ETFs showing renewed appetite</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ETF positioning remains well below the 2020 peak, leaving room for further inflows. After a period of consolidation, gold ETFs are once again attracting investor interest. While central bank buying continues to anchor the market, ETFs have the capacity to amplify price moves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If rate‑cut expectations firm or geopolitical risks intensify, a renewed wave of ETF inflows could provide another leg higher for gold prices. Historically, ETF holdings tend to rise alongside prices and are closely linked to expectations for US monetary policy, reinforcing the case for stronger inflows as the Fed moves towards easier policy.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">ETF flows respond to shifts in Fed policy</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721529097852695_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"744\" data-height=\"343\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721529097852695_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ETF flows respond to shifts in Fed policy\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"295\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721529097852695_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721529097852695_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721529097852695_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/7176741-17721529097852695_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: US Fed, Refinitiv, ING Research</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">5. Digital dollars and reserve evolution</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reserve evolution is no longer confined to central banks. The rapid growth of US dollar-backed stablecoins has created a new institutional buyer of reserve assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stablecoin issuers, most notably <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-28/tether-is-shaking-up-the-gold-market-with-massive-metal-hoard\" rel=\"noopener\">Tether</a>, have become significant buyers of reserve assets, including US Treasuries and increasingly gold. Tether alone purchased over 70 tonnes of gold last year, second only to Poland among reported buyers, and now holds around 140 tonnes across its reserves and gold‑backed token.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If gold remains part of this reserve strategy, stablecoin growth could represent an additional structural source of demand, behaving more like central bank buying than retail flows. While still smaller in scale, this channel adds another layer of structural support.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Momentum may slow, but the case for gold remains</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The path higher is unlikely to be linear. At record price levels, physical demand is becoming more price sensitive, and periods of consolidation – or short-term corrections – should be expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the structural pillars of this rally – central bank diversification, geopolitical fragmentation, potential policy easing and renewed ETF interest – remain intact. For now, the broader environment continues to favour gold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

The thesis followed Michael Burry's disclosure of<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> short positions in Nvidia (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) and Palantir (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR\" title=\"Palantir Technologies Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">PLTR</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), labeling AI a \"bubble.\" PKW could hedge this risk by avoiding concentration risk in technology and focusing instead on shareholder return. This strategy proved successful, with PKW returning 6.34% and outperforming the S&amp;P 500 by nearly 4% </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content\">with less volatility</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">. The fund focuses on buyback yield, favoring companies that are repurchasing a minimum of 5% of their float.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My only concern was PKW's relatively high total expense ratio (0.62%). Recently, I began looking at other funds that could achieve the same objective and came across the iShares Core Dividend ETF (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIVB\" title=\"iShares Core Dividend ETF\">DIVB</a></span>). This fund aims to accomplish the same objective by maximizing the total capital returned to investors via divi<span class=\"highlighted_text\">dends <em>and</em> buyb</span>acks. In other words, it invests in companies with the highest total shareholder return (defined as the buyback yield, plus the dividend yield). It avoids high concentration risk in individual stocks, with Exxon Mobil (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>) being the largest holding. It also does not avoid technology, which is actually the highest-weighted sector. Instead, it favors \"old\" technology companies like Cisco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSCO\" title=\"Cisco Systems, Inc.\">CSCO</a>), Texas Instruments (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TXN\" title=\"Texas Instruments Incorporated\">TXN</a>), and Qualcomm (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QCOM\" title=\"QUALCOMM Incorporated\">QCOM</a>) that return massive capital flows to their investors. The fund has a lower beta than the overall market (0.88) and a total expense ratio of only 0.05%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, for similar reasons as PKW, I rate DIVB a Buy for investors looking to remove technology risk from their portfolios via a simple, diversified ETF.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>DIVB: The Diversification And Value Edge Vs. The S&amp;P 500</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A major difference between the S&amp;P 500 and DIVB lies not only in which stocks they hold but in why they hold them. As a market capitalization-weighted index, the S&amp;P 500 has become heavy in technology because these have been the best-performing stocks over the course of the current bull market. Information technology has reached around 35% because the more large technology stocks outperform, the higher the resulting weighting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DIVB, on the other hand, gravitates toward companies that return capital to shareholders; defined as the <em>net buyback yield plus dividend yield</em>. Interestingly, this leads to a portfolio composition that's not extremely different from the S&amp;P 500, except for the largest stocks in the index. Most notably, the fund is underweight information technology (24.05%), while it's overweight financials (19.72%) and energy (4.47%).

He believes that the huge spending on chips and data centers has led to understated depreciation. If he is correct, it will lead to pressure on the earnings of big tech in the coming years, pressuring the long-term earnings growth expected by analysts. As I have <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4870233-great-commoditization-how-to-invest-in-post-ai-world\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4870233-great-commoditization-how-to-invest-in-post-ai-world\" target=\"_blank\">previously written</a>, the sheer magnitude of big tech capex spending is breathtaking. It's roughly $700B this year and potentially $1T next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think there's some confusion among investors about the growth that big tech is currently pursuing. <em>Not all growth creates value.</em> There's no question that big tech will see phenomenal revenue growth in the coming years due to AI demand. The question is whether big tech is spending so much today that the discounted value of those cash flows will be insufficient to create value for shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To quote my favorite investor, <a href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2016620/warren-buffetts-letters-1992\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2016620/warren-buffetts-letters-1992\" target=\"_blank\">Warren Buffett</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Growth benefits investors only when the business in point can invest at incremental returns that are enticing—in other words, only when each dollar used to finance the growth creates over a dollar of long-term market value. In the case of a low-return business requiring incremental funds, grow<span class=\"highlighted_text\">th <em>hurts the investor.</em></span></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, there is substantial risk to investors in big tech. The risk is not that demand for AI will evaporate, and it's not that the companies are overvalued based on a reasonable forecast of cash flow. Rather, the risk is that the huge spending today will eventually generate multiple AI products that will become commoditized. Further, the capex required to fund this growth is extremely high, leading to a pincer attacking the value of cash flow from multiple angles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>), Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), Microsoft (via OpenAI and Copilot), and Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) (via Anthropic) all profit from AI, there are only two possibilities. One is they all reach roughly the same product, and that product is a commodity. The second is that only a few win, but the rest must lose. Thus, the eventual return on investment for AI is uncertain. It's even possible that the return will become so low that we look back years from now, acknowledging that Burry was correct in his \"bubble\" call.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The S&amp;P 500 has become concentrated in a few growth companies to a degree only witnessed in 1929. While the growth promised by AI and modern technology is undeniable, the spending to achieve that growth calls returns into question. Investors should remember Warren Buffett's advice: Growth only creates value when the return on invested capital is high; otherwise, it can ultimately destroy shareholder value. To be clear: I do not present this as a bear thesis for the S&amp;P 500, it's simply a risk that growth-oriented investors are taking. My primary concern about the S&amp;P 500 is that rather than being diversified, the largest companies in it are taking similar risks. This could end well or badly depending on the eventual returns from investment in AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By traditional DCF metrics, the largest companies in the S&amp;P 500 appear reasonably valued. However, these businesses are in transition, and investing in them today is a bet that AI will offer sufficient return on capital to create shareholder value. For investors who wish to diversify, the iShares Core Dividend ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIVB\" title=\"iShares Core Dividend ETF\">DIVB</a>) offers a highly efficient way to maintain exposure preferentially to companies that are returning capital to shareholders instead of spending it on AI.

Traditional <a href=\"https://www.breakthrought1d.org/daily-management/administering-insulin/#:~:text=There%20are%20four%20primary%20methods,to%20correct%20high%20blood%20sugars.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">insulin delivery systems</a> include subcutaneous methods (injections, pens) that require multiple daily self-administered injections (MDI), which enable both basal and bolus insulin release. Insulin pumps are small devices that contain a continuous supply of insulin through a tiny tube inserted under the skin to deliver both basal and bolus insulin. Finally, we have automated insulin delivery systems. This is the niche in which Insulet operates with its Omnipod products. These are devices that create one comprehensive system, including a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), an insulin pump, and algorithms that automatically manage and adjust insulin delivery in real time. Together, these minimize human error through manual calculations and increase convenience as they don’t need to be self-administered; the whole process is automated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://www.omnipod.com/simplify/omnipod-5?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=prso-aw&amp;utm_content=pmax-brnd&amp;ctoken=7012J000001gYaiQAE&amp;utm_id=21364100800&amp;ad_group_id=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21353736900&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADzvGq4OIHpEQOgCA0WUrjnhmDe9l&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA7-rMBhCFARIsAKnLKtBEwv7j3GQs4GUobHS9zS0FwvQw8Wr6XZQGEcO1ZsXlzWZSOegoNEwaAlpYEALw_wcB\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Omnipod</a> system is a tubeless, waterproof, wearable pod with a complementary app to administer bolus insulin. Similar automated insulin delivery (AID) devices still require patients to calculate carbohydrates in meals to administer bolus insulin before meals. Omnipod facilitates this through their SmartBolus calculator feature in the app, which recommends a dose level, after which patients click confirm, and the system delivers the amount. The pod contains their algorithm, which is paired with CGM systems to automatically adjust and regulate insulin delivery every 5 minutes. What’s unique about this device is its recurring revenue through its almost subscription-like elements. Each pod has a lifespan of 72 hours, creating the need to constantly replace them. The <a href=\"https://investors.insulet.com/news/news-details/2025/Insulet-Announces-FDA-510k-Clearance-of-Omnipod-5-Algorithm-Enhancements-that-Redefine-Insulin-Delivery-and-Simplify-the-Pod-Experience/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">FDA</a> cleared these pods in January 2022 for use in type 1 diabetics aged 2 years and above and type 2 diabetics aged 18 years and above.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PODD has 3 primary streams of revenue: US (71%), International (28%), and Drug Delivery (1%). Their US segment accounts for revenues from the sale of Omnipod products (the current Omnipod 5 and legacy Omnipod DASH). The international segment accounts for the sale of Omnipod products across the US border. Finally, their Drug Delivery segment refers to revenues from PODD partnering with other firms to use their tubeless pods to deliver non-insulin drugs. As per their <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001145197/c5bd9e29-b4db-468c-8cad-bb8d3f08960e.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">10K</a>, they primarily sell pods to Amgen here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings and Financials</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001145197/c5bd9e29-b4db-468c-8cad-bb8d3f08960e.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earnings</a> blew it out of the park! We saw revenues climb 31% year over year to 783 million. We saw an EPS surprise of over 4%. We saw international Omnipod revenue grow over 50% year over year, showing us how their international expansion represents a real long-term growth opportunity, as I’ll discuss later in this report. The main takeaways from the earnings were that it reflects the underpenetrated international market and the massive opportunity it represents, the exploding adoption of Omnipod 5 and its mass appeal as a leading tubeless AID insulin pump, and the authorization of a 300 million share repurchase program. The company generated a 24% increase in FCF on a year-on-year basis, and there’s a massive runway for further value creation to shareholders as demonstrated by this buyback program. Moreover, their current ratio, at 2.81, reflects high liquidity and more than solid coverage of short-term obligations. Their total debt level of $949 million, implying a d/e ratio of 0.63x, is well covered by $716 million in cash. Insulet boasts strong margin expansion driven by the success of Omnipod 5 and its launch in international markets. We’ve seen a +184 bps increase in gross margins from 2024 to 71.6%, well above their peers of Medtronic plc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDT\" title=\"Medtronic plc\">MDT</a>) (65%) and Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TNDM\" title=\"Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc.\">TNDM</a>) (54%). Furthermore, their operating margin has grown by +54 bps to 15.5%. The decline in net profit margin is driven by a one-time non-operating expense (loss on extinguishment of debt) and a normalized tax expense as opposed to the tax benefit received previously. The underlying business demonstrates great growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Industry and Competitive Dynamics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://diabetesatlas.org/resources/idf-diabetes-atlas-2025/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Currently</a>, the adult population (people aged 20-79 years) of diabetics has reached almost 600 million and is expected to grow by 45% to over 850 million by 2050.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642617981_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"722\" data-height=\"432\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642617981_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IDF Adult Population Diabetes Projected Growth (2050)\" width=\"640\" height=\"383\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642617981_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642617981_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642617981_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642617981_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IDF Adult Population Diabetes Projected Growth <span>(International Diabetes Federation (IDF)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of this, Type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounts for over <a href=\"https://idf.org/about-diabetes/diabetes-facts-figures/\" rel=\"nofollow\">90%</a> of all diabetes cases worldwide.

Medtronic is the largest company and has captured the majority of the market with its MiniMed 780G (released in 2023), having captured <a href=\"https://www.marketreportsworld.com/market-reports/insulin-pump-market-14716747#:~:text=Top%20Two%20Companies%20with%20Highest,contribute%20to%20its%20growing%20adoption.\" rel=\"nofollow\">36%</a> of the insulin pump market. However, PODD has positioned itself as the best all-encompassing product in the market with Omnipod 5’s tubeless nature, CGM, automated insulin adjustment algorithm, and app-based control and deployment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insulet’s market share of the insulin pump market exceeds 25%, and it continues to aggressively steal market share from the competition. The market is concerned with the future competitive landscape of the pump market, as in the near term (early 2026), Tandem is coming out with Tubeless Mobi, a tubeless AID device with a product lifespan of 7 days compared to Omnipod 5’s 3-day lifespan. After this, Tandem hopes to launch Sigi, a 7-day, tubeless AID device that seeks to differentiate itself and capture market share for its rechargeable capability. Moreover, Medtronic is set to submit its own tubeless model for FDA approval in late 2026. The threat here lies in Medtronic’s deep pockets, considering it is a much larger company with an almost $130 billion market cap, a massive installed base, and prior relationships, which would allow it to recapture market share if successful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insulet responds by developing Omnipod 6, currently enrolled in trial phases, and <a href=\"https://www.drugdeliverybusiness.com/insulet-investor-day-omnipod-6-2027/#:~:text=The%20company%20has%20fully%20enrolled,advanced%20technology%2C%E2%80%9D%20Benjamin%20said.\" rel=\"nofollow\">expected</a> to submit by the end of 2026 and launch in 2027. They release the results of their trials at the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2026 conference. Given Omnipod 5's strong clinical performance, boasting <a href=\"https://www.omnipod.com/hcp/c/outcomes\" rel=\"nofollow\">80%</a> Time in Range (TIR), I expect Omnipod 6 to reflect similarly strong trials given its adaptive AI learning algorithm. Furthermore, their fully closed-loop device is in the early clinical stage, set to launch in 2028. There are 3 primary pump types: open loop, fully user-controlled; hybrid closed loop, automated with the occasional need for user input; and closed loop, fully automated. Insulet and the majority of its competitors are hybrid-closed loop, in that they fully automate basal insulin doses based on glucose trends reflected in the CGM; however, they require users to manually program bolus insulin dose amounts based on the carb count of their meals. Insulet’s SmartBolus Calculator recommends a bolus dose amount based on user-input data to facilitate the process, and once accepted, it administers the dose.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Market is Overstating the Impact of GLP-1s</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/13901-glp-1-agonists\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glucagon Like Peptides (GLP-1)</a> drugs are a class of medication that help manage blood sugar (glucose) levels in people with type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 is a naturally occurring hormone that your small intestine produces: triggering insulin from the pancreas, blocking glucagon secretion, and satiating oneself. These drugs aren’t yet FDA-approved to treat type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is a chronic autoimmune condition that destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Once destroyed, these cells are not replaced. Conversely, type 2 diabetes still has insulin-producing cells that do so, but in fact, they become resistant to it. Therefore, GLP-1 drugs have no impact on treating type 1 diabetes, as they enhance insulin secretion, but type 1 diabetics suffer from the body destroying their own insulin-producing beta cells.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market <a href=\"https://www.medicaldevice-network.com/analyst-comment/glp-1-medications-diabetic-devices-market/\" rel=\"nofollow\">believes</a> that the emergence of GLP-1 and SGLT2 inhibitors poses a direct threat to insulin delivery devices, with shares in the past dropping almost 12% <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4698698-insulet-insulin-pump-provider-fighting-back-after-torrid-2023\">because of GLP-1 news</a>, but is overstating this impact. There is a fundamental misalignment between what it believes the relationship between GLP-1s and insulin delivery devices is and what the reality of the situation is. GLP-1s cannot effectively treat type 1 diabetes, and PODD serves a customer base of predominantly <a href=\"https://matrixbcg.com/blogs/target-market/insulet#:~:text=The%20primary%20customer%20segments%20for,Direct%2Dto%2DConsumer%20Model\" rel=\"nofollow\">type 1 diabetics</a>. Moreover, within their type 2 diabetes customer base, they target exclusively individuals placed on intensive insulin therapy. These patients require multiple daily injections (MDI) and are beyond the point where GLP-1s alone would be effective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273643477955_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"816\" data-height=\"558\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273643477955_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"T2D Patient Journey\" width=\"640\" height=\"438\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273643477955_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273643477955_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273643477955_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273643477955_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">PODD Targets T2D Patients Placed on Intensive Insulin Therapy <span>(Northern Light Health)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The emergence of GLP-1s doesn't place any direct threat to Insulet’s current customer base (T1D patients and T2D patients placed on intensive insulin therapy). One may think, “Ok, it doesn’t affect their current market, but won’t GLP-1s reduce the number of patients that reach the point where they need intensive insulin therapy, and therefore reduce the future market size?” I argue the contrary; industry experts such as <a href=\"https://www.drugdeliverybusiness.com/analysts-glp-1s-minor-impact-insulin-pump/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Dr. Osama Hamdy</a> have elucidated that GLP-1s complement the insulin delivery devices industry, increasing the need for constant glucose monitors (CGMs). With Omnipod being one of the best quality, all-encompassing tools on the market, integrated with CGM, bolus insulin administering app with their SmartBolus Calculator feature, and convenience (through a waterproof feature, being tubeless, and being small), it creates sticky demand as new customers will favor Omnipod 5 over others in the market.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insulet’s International Expansion Focus Represents Untapped Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PODD’s international segments currently account for almost <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001145197/c5bd9e29-b4db-468c-8cad-bb8d3f08960e.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">30%</a> of revenue. <a href=\"https://investors.insulet.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Historically</a>, this segment has had little to no revenue growth until <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001145197/722ce3e1-5363-4e81-8218-2556789ba894.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2023</a>. In <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001145197/32ac37c2-1597-473b-830c-4317b91b64e6.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2024</a>, we saw international revenue growth outpace US Omnipod revenue by over 7% (28% vs 21%), and it has upheld that trend in the following quarters. This reflects the existence of a time lag between when Omnipod 5 first launched in international markets and when the growth materialized into a contribution to top-line growth. Omnipod 5 has only just launched in European markets, arriving in <a href=\"https://investor.insulet.com/news/news-details/2023/Insulet-Announces-Full-Market-Release-of-Omnipod-5-Automated-Insulin-Delivery-System-in-Germany/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Germany</a> and the UK in 2023, and since then has expanded into <a href=\"https://investors.insulet.com/news/news-details/2025/Insulet-Launches-Revolutionary-Omnipod-5-in-Five-More-Countries-in-Europe/default.aspx#:~:text=The%20Omnipod%205%20Automated%20Insulin,Finland%2C%20Norway%2C%20and%20Sweden.\" rel=\"nofollow\">9 countries</a>. What I find interesting is that this is an active expansion; it’s ongoing, with them bringing Omnipod 5 to various other countries in 2026 and expanding focus into the <a href=\"https://www.drugdeliverybusiness.com/insulet-launches-omnipod-5-omnipod-discover-in-the-middle-east/#:~:text=Insulet%20launches%20Omnipod%205%2C%20Omnipod,it%20can%20pair%20with%20G7.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Middle East</a>. Having just entered many European nations as recently as March 2025, I expect to see great growth trends. My thesis lies in the opportunity that the Europe and Middle East expansion represents. As mentioned earlier, the majority of PODD’s revenue comes from type 1 diabetics, and Europe has the highest population of type 1 diabetics, and it's growing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642361078_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"764\" data-height=\"380\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642361078_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"T1D Population Around the World\" width=\"640\" height=\"318\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642361078_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642361078_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642361078_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642361078_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">T1D Population Around the World <span>(International Diabetes Federation (IDF)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, the MENA region, as portrayed by the graph earlier, represents the second-largest addressable market, with the diabetes population forecasted to grow 92% by 2050. This will drive further TAM expansion from their current $30 billion level.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">T2D Market is Underpenetrated</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global diabetes is expected to grow <a href=\"https://idf.org/about-diabetes/diabetes-facts-figures/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">46%</a> by 2050. 90% of the diabetic population are Type 2 diabetics. However, the T2D market is quite underpenetrated, with extremely low <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03007995.2023.2205795#d1e203\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener\">5%</a> adoption rates for insulin pumps. This 5% rate is projected to reach <a href=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/insulin-pump-market-102735\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">15%</a> by 2027. Insulet is set to see the largest gains from this based on two key factors: their structural moat as the best tubeless AID device on the market and their distribution channel strategy. Their moat lies in the fact that they're the most <a href=\"https://www.usmed.com/best-insulin-pumps/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">prominent</a> tubeless devices on the market, and their tubeless nature makes them less visible and more discreet. Moreover, most of their major competitors rely on traditional paths where insulin pumps are distributed through Durable Medical Equipment (DME) channels. This is often a <a href=\"https://www.breakthrought1d.org/t1d-resources/insurance/issues-around-insulin-pumps/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">complex</a> and heavily regulated path, which brings along a lot of paperwork, security, and insurance guidelines. Additionally, this model typically locks consumers into a large, long-term contract wherein they pay a high upfront cost to use the product. However, Insulet benefits from being the first in the market to establish the pay-as-you-go model in which consumers pay for pods as needed, rather than being fixed into long-term contracts. This makes Omnipod 5 a more affordable and more convenient option, setting Insulet to lead the T2D penetration. Insulet’s historically high FCF margins also demonstrate a wide runway for reinvestment into R&amp;D and developing their fully closed-loop devices aimed specifically at providing complete AID devices for people with T2D.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The largest risk the market remains cautious of is the competitive landscape. As mentioned earlier, Tandem is coming out with Tubeless Mobi, with a superior product lifespan of 7 days compared to Omnipod 5’s 3-day lifespan, as well as Sigi, unique for its rechargeable capability. Medtronic is set to submit its own tubeless model for FDA approval in late 2026, which, if approved, poses a major threat with its deeper pockets, massive installed base, and prior relationships, allowing MDT to recapture market share if successful. Furthermore, their success does require continued conversion of patients on MDI and competing pump systems. Delays in FDA approval, technical challenges, or slower-than-expected clinician adoption could also hinder revenue growth (regulatory clearance of enhancements to Omnipod 5 and the planned launch of Omnipod 6).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based solely on comparable company analysis, the stock seems to be trading at a higher relative valuation, which, at face value, may seem indicative of overvaluation. However, I argue that this represents the premium investors are willing to pay for the stock for the expected future growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-1771827364243484_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"922\" data-height=\"228\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-1771827364243484_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Comps Table of PODD\" width=\"640\" height=\"158\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-1771827364243484_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-1771827364243484_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-1771827364243484_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-1771827364243484_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Comps Table of PODD <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ve created a comprehensive financial model with revenue build, operating model, and supporting schedules, all of which plug into a DCF, which indicates an implied share price of $330, suggesting a +35% upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642435205_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"820\" data-height=\"164\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273642435205_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Sensitivity Table at 1.5%-3.5% PGR &amp;

Additionally, this thought process was based on the fact that there is strong competition in the US markets in the near future, with various firms, as discussed earlier, expanding their AID market footprint, which I believe would eventually lead to a slight decline in ASP in order to stay competitive and compete with the behemoth that is MDT. I did, however, forecast this to normalize eventually into a 70/30 US/International revenue mix. Moreover, my assumptions were driven by the idea that PODD’s future sales are a reflection of a stable, growing installed base rather than episodic sales. I forecast end-of-period (EOP) installed base to grow at an aggressive CAGR of almost 20%, driven by the broader market appeal Omnipod 5 generates as an all-encompassing tubeless AID device, T2D penetration, and international expansion. The output is based on an 8.92% WACC and a 2.5% PGR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273647724001_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"769\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273647724001_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PODD Revenue Build\" width=\"640\" height=\"308\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273647724001_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273647724001_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273647724001_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/60809231-17718273647724001_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">PODD Revenue Build <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on all that is discussed in this report, I believe Insulet is a buy with a 12-month price target of $330, representing 35% upside. GLP-1 concerns are exaggerated, with Insulet’s core customer base of T1D and T2D patients on intensive insulin therapy unaffected. International expansion and shifting focus into the Middle East represent strong growth prospects (with +50% YoY growth). The T2D market is still underpenetrated, giving PODD a large runway for growth, with pump adoption expected to triple to 15% by 2027. The 2026 ADA conference will be something to look out for as a near-term catalyst, as well as the continued success of international growth driven by active European market expansion. At an 8.92% WACC and 2.5% PGR, my DCF reflects a $330 implied share price backed by reasonable assumptions. The growth has only just begun.</p>",
