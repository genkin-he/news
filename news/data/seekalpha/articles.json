Among these, uniQure (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QURE\" title=\"uniQure N.V.\">QURE</a>) underperformed after regulatory expectations shifted, with U.S. Food and Drug Administration feedback challenging its proposed filing strategy for Huntington's disease, reducing visibility on the approval pathway. Mereo BioPharma Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MREO\" title=\"Mereo BioPharma Group plc\">MREO</a>) also detracted after its Phase III osteogenesis imperfecta trial failed to meet its primary endpoint, representing a material setback for the investment case. Precision BioSciences (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DTIL\" title=\"Precision BioSciences, Inc.\">DTIL</a>) further detracted as a capital raise heightened dilution concerns, weighing on sentiment towards early-stage gene-editing companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positive contributions were led by Abivax (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABVX\" title=\"ABIVAX Société Anonyme\">ABVX</a>), the Fund's strongest performer, as confidence built around obefazimod after robust Phase III induction data in ulcerative colitis. A broader re-rating of SMID-cap biotechnology also supported performance. AstraZeneca (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZN\" title=\"AstraZeneca PLC\">AZN</a>) contributed strongly as investors favored large-cap pharmaceutical companies with durable earnings and consistent execution, while Eli Lilly (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY\" title=\"Eli Lilly and Company\">LLY</a>) continued to perform well on sustained enthusiasm for its incretin franchise, supported by expanding indications and improving manufacturing visibility.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Market review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global healthcare performance in 2025 was shaped more by shifting investor tolerance for uncertainty than by any lack of innovation. The sector lagged broader equity markets for much of the year as investors focused on perceived \"safe\" growth themes, most notably artificial intelligence, while healthcare faced regulatory, policy, pricing, and trade-related uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This underperformance reflected sentiment and valuation rather than fundamentals. Healthcare entered 2025 trading at one of the widest valuation discounts to global equities in decades, a gap that widened further after new U.S. tariffs announced in April triggered a sharp sell-off, particularly in small- and mid-cap (SMID-cap) biotechnology. As tariff concerns eased, valuations rebounded, driven by company-specific execution, improving balance sheets and visible clinical or regulatory catalysts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fourth quarter marked a turning point as policy overhangs eased and interest rates declined. U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts supported research and development-intensive businesses, while accelerating mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) activity reinforced the strategic value of differentiated assets. Despite volatility linked to a U.S. government shutdown, healthcare's defensive characteristics proved resilient, with more constructive conditions also emerging outside the U.S.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Activity</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the quarter, activity focused on reallocating capital towards higher-upside opportunities, particularly within SMID-cap healthcare and globally differentiated assets that are less widely followed by U.S.-centric investors, while trimming exposure to heavily owned large-cap companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">New positions spanned therapeutics, diagnostics, and enabling technologies, including Ascendis (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASND\" title=\"Ascendis Pharma A/S\">ASND</a>), CareDx (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CDNA\" title=\"CareDx, Inc.\">CDNA</a>), Disc Medicine (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IRON\" title=\"Disc Medicine, Inc.\">IRON</a>), Praxis (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PRAX\" title=\"Praxis Precision Medicines, Inc.\">PRAX</a>), Structure Therapeutics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GPCR\" title=\"Structure Therapeutics Inc.\">GPCR</a>), Oxford Nanopore (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ONTTF\" title=\"Oxford Nanopore Technologies plc\">ONTTF</a>), GPCR-focused therapeutics, Quoin Pharma (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QNRX\" title=\"Quoin Pharmaceuticals, Ltd.\">QNRX</a>), and Ironwood (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IRWD\" title=\"Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\">IRWD</a>)-related innovation exposure. Additional exposure was added through Perceptive Capital Solutions aligned with Freenome, alongside the initiation of Veradermics as a venture investment to access early-stage innovation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the disposal side, positions were sold where conviction had diminished, including Johnson &amp; Johnson (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNJ\" title=\"Johnson &amp; Johnson\">JNJ</a>), Pfizer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>), ResMed (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RMD\" title=\"ResMed Inc.\">RMD</a>), Veradigm (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDRX\" title=\"Veradigm Inc.\">MDRX</a>), Exact Sciences (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXAS\" title=\"Exact Sciences Corporation\">EXAS</a>), Community Health Systems (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CYH\" title=\"Community Health Systems, Inc.\">CYH</a>), BioNTech (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BNTX\" title=\"BioNTech SE\">BNTX</a>), Prenetics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PRE\" title=\"Prenetics Global Limited\">PRE</a>), and Mereo BioPharma after its Phase III setback in osteogenesis imperfecta. Bond exposure was modestly reduced, with capital tilted towards equity opportunities while maintaining a meaningful fixed-income allocation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook &amp; strategy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead to 2026, we believe the global healthcare sector is entering a more constructive phase. After several years of relative underperformance, valuations across many parts of healthcare—particularly outside the most heavily owned U.S. mega-cap companies—remain attractive compared with the broader equity market. While macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty is unlikely to disappear, we view the balance of risks and opportunities as improving, especially as interest rates have begun to ease and policy-related headwinds appear less acute than earlier in 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Importantly, the long-term fundamentals underpinning healthcare remain firmly intact. Aging populations, rising prevalence of chronic disease, and continued innovation across oncology, rare disease, neurology, and enabling technologies continue to drive demand globally. At the same time, accelerating M&amp;A activity highlights the strategic value of differentiated assets and reinforces our view that high-quality innovation is scarce and increasingly sought after by large pharmaceutical and life sciences companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our strategy is designed to take advantage of this environment through a globally diversified, actively managed portfolio. We continue to emphasize SMID healthcare companies, where valuation dispersion is greatest and where company-specific execution can meaningfully drive returns. We are particularly focused on identifying non-U.S. opportunities that may be underappreciated by U.S.-centric investors, while maintaining exposure to select U.S. companies where we believe the risk-reward remains compelling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also complement public equity holdings with selective venture investments and maintain a diversified portfolio construction that includes fixed income, even after modest adjustments. This balanced approach allows us to participate in healthcare's innovation upside while managing volatility through different market environments. We remain optimistic about the opportunity set ahead and are committed to disciplined capital allocation as we seek to deliver long-term value for shareholders.</p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">References</h4> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>1.

Non-U.S. developed markets equities outperformed U.S. stocks. Large-cap equities outperformed small- and mid-cap stocks in the quarter, while value-oriented stocks<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> outperformed growth.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The U.S. economy continued expanding, but growth slowed somewhat as the quarter progressed. The U.S. government shutdown that began in October and dragged into early November did not dramatically deter investors, even as it delayed or eliminated key government economic data. The Federal Reserve, reacting to weakness in the U.S. labor market, reduced its benchmark interest rate twice during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bonds had a positive quarter across the board. Nearly all sectors of the bond market advanced. Treasuries slightly outperformed investment-grade corporates. Corporate bond returns were limited by the same economic uncertainty that weighed on U.S. equities during the period. Investment-grade U.S. bonds outperformed non-U.S. bonds on a currency-neutral basis.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Contributors</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">International holdings led the way. Top absolute performers in the applicable portfolios were International Value, Non-U.S. Intrinsic Value, Emerging Markets and Focused Dynamic Growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nearly all bond positions gained. Across fixed-income holdings, Emerging Markets Debt, High Income and Short Duration were top performers.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Detractors</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Few absolute detractors for the quarter. In a strong environment for both equities and bonds, only Heritage, Small Cap Value, Inflation-Adjusted Bond and Global Real Estate generated negative returns during the quarter.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook and Dynamic Risk Management Process</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We continue to see innovation and opportunity in equity markets. The financial markets delivered positive returns in 2025 despite the backdrop of geopolitical and policy uncertainties. Similarly, U.S. economic growth remains resilient.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Economic and market risks remain, however. On the one hand, interest rate and tax cuts are likely to be supportive of growth and equities. On the other hand, the U.S. stock market remains very expensive and highly concentrated. We expect volatility to be a constant companion in the new year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the fixed-income markets, sector and security selection will be crucial. The current environment of elevated government spending, growing fiscal debt and inflecting interest rates favors an active and nimble approach to fixed-income portfolio management.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Diversification and risk management remain central to successful approaches. Geopolitical, economic and market uncertainties put a premium on prudent risk management going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dynamic risk positioning reflects balance of risks. At the end of September, we maintained our long-term, neutral glide path positioning, which is intended to address the various competing risks investors face across their lifetime.

We believe that ultimately, this massive push to build out AI infrastructure will remain the leading investment angle for the foreseeable future, and this should help to provide a floor for many of the large technology companies that make up an <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/22/your-portfolio-may-be-more-tech-heavy-than-you-think.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">overweight</a> portion of S&amp;P 500 earnings.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Global Conflicts Remain a Presence Across Multiple Markets</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are still numerous conflicts that pose a risk to overall market stability that we should keep in mind as investors in 2026. Right now, the most imminent threat remains the possible conflict in Iran, as US warships and military might <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/us-military-iran-buildup-nuclear-program-5663a8b0d81c8439adfaa010c59a36f5\" rel=\"nofollow\">continue to grow</a> in the region. This is certainly not an ideal situation, but from an investment perspective, wars and conflicts require funding and aerospace and defense companies also make up a portion of the S&amp;P. A notable consideration is that across NATO allies, defense spending is increasing dramatically, and this should serve as another tailwind for investors to keep an eye on. View the following graph from the <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/commentary/trackers-and-data-visualizations/nato-defense-spending-tracker/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atlantic Council</a> that shows current NATO spending levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51119559-17721517500225143_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1169\" data-height=\"950\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51119559-17721517500225143_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NATO Defense Spending\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"520\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51119559-17721517500225143_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51119559-17721517500225143_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51119559-17721517500225143_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51119559-17721517500225143_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Atlantic Council</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the <a href=\"https://www.nato.int/en/what-we-do/introduction-to-nato/defence-expenditures-and-natos-5-commitment\" rel=\"nofollow\">new goal of 5% of GDP</a> for all members, you can clearly see that every single member of NATO has a ways to go before they reach this new bar. This push in increasing spending will serve as a strong tailwind for the sector and many firms in the S&amp;P.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Lower Interest Rates Will Help to Boost Spending</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As rates go lower, there will be more spending and investment as cheaper money rolls around.

With rates at their lowest in 3 years, we believe that there may be increased spending that results from this, in addition to savings from AI.

Note that we are looking at “total returns” here which also account for dividends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We see that VOO is clearly beating SPYI, by 20% across the last 3 years. In the beginning of the period, we see that the 2 had very similar performance, but over time VOO pulled out ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We see this as a bearish sign for SPYI. The fund is positioned to provide exposure to the S&amp;P 500 while also <a href=\"https://neosfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/SPYI-Prospectus.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">primarily focused on generating income.</a> Despite the net credit call strategy, its participation in the SP500's rallies is capped while exposure to the downside has no structural protection. As such, we see that investors would have been better off just buying and holding VOO. This is especially an issue when you compare VOO’s expense ratio of 0.03% to SPYI’s expense ratio of 0.68% (22.67x larger).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are sectors at risk, such as commercial real estate, that could alarm investors broadly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With $2 trillion of <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/commercial/lenders-to-commercial-real-estate-owners-pay-up-now-a4509562?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqcVPATMM3tX78ZJxfdihj0Jy3fgS-BYG0Wcnpdqn_cTwfQ8dofxQ7w6SgH7KHA%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69a0e551&amp;gaa_sig=r-80Tf-_Pvr5uTWvXtw9RsTXWujP092VCk2Z1uWnafq0LM9xvf2tkr9m9bB7MVcHuCkJ_Lpdm2C-zsws3whSAw%3D%3D\" rel=\"nofollow\">real estate debt</a> coming due soon, lenders are starting to become nervous about borrowers repaying their loans. This could cause a panic in the markets if a large borrow declares bankruptcy, or if this leads to other signs of contagion. However, we believe that this risk is low as leading real estate firms such as Costar have outlined options for scaling this wall of debt, and since the issues stemming from the financial crisis, lenders are more well-built to remain solvent and less risky than before.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>There is a Downturn in the Market</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In our comparison chart in the previous section, we see that when the market is in a downturn, SPYI does perform better than VOO. Zooming into the downturn period in the chart we see:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51119559-177215174992115_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1226\" data-height=\"439\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51119559-177215174992115_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SPYI vs VOO - Downturn\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"229\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51119559-177215174992115_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51119559-177215174992115_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51119559-177215174992115_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51119559-177215174992115_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SPYI outperformed VOO by about 2% in this period from Feb 14th 2025 to April 8th 2025. This is due to the funds covered call spread strategy where a cheaper option is purchased while a more expensive one is sold. This provides the fund with some instant profit and creates a better performance than the underlying equity during downturns. However the strategy also provides lower profits as the underlying equity increases in value.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The broader market and S&amp;P 500 remain ideal long-term investments for an investor. There are significant tailwinds that should be pushing the markets towards new highs, including AI CapEx, defense spending, and lower rates boosting expenditures everywhere. We believe that these factors are bullish and should provide long-term investors solid growth in the years to come.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, SPYI is not a good option for investors at this point. The market has a lot of tailwinds pushing its value up in the short term and a covered call spread would decrease your participation in those gains. On a total return basis, SPYI has lagged behind VOO consistently as a result. The S&amp;P 500 has historically increased over decades, and it's not a good idea to bet against the market. Hard pass — just buy VOO and save 22.67x on expense ratios.</p>",

Updates from H2 2024 Letter</li> <li>IV. Mistakes</li> </ol> <hr> <h2>I. Investment Philosophy &amp; Overview</h2> <p>\"Someone's sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.\"- Warren Buffett</p> <p><em>Before diving in, I'd encourage you to revisi<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/whit-huguley/analysis\">t </a><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/whit-huguley/analysis\" rel=\"noopener\">past letters</a> – many ideas here build on earlier ones that would be too long to re-introduce.</em></p> <p>Six years ago, I started River Oaks Capital with a simple premise: find the small, underfollowed public companies in overlooked corners of the markets where wonderful businesses hide in plain sight, unnoticed and undervalued.</p> <p>I knew this meant putting in a tremendous amount of 'boots on the ground' work. However, what I didn't fully appreciate then was how much that work would evolve over time.</p> <p>Six years into running River Oaks Capital, one lesson keeps intensifying – achieving above-average returns in these companies requires rolling up my sleeves more and more.</p> <p>Before I dive in deeper here, let's quickly review the capital raising process every company goes through – discussed in detail in the <a href=\"https://www.riveroaks-capital.com/investment-memos\" rel=\"nofollow\">H1 2024 letter</a> .</p> <p>At some point in nearly every company's growth journey, outside capital is needed.</p> <p>For generations, the traditional U.S. path was an <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">IPO</a> on the NASDAQ or NYSE.</p> <p>But then the story changed. Private equity and venture capital emerged onto the scene and let many companies stay private until they were worth billions.</p> <p>The pros and cons of each capital raising route is a topic for another time.</p> <p>What has become abundantly clear over the six years of running River Oaks Capital is that the U.S. small, underfollowed public companies are becoming increasingly more ignored and thus undervalued.</p> <p>The reason driving the depressed valuations of nearly every one of these companies is long listed and very often times warranted – as shown in the River Oaks Capital one pager <a href=\"https://www.riveroaks-capital.com/fund-overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">(</a><a href=\"https://www.datalab.to/playground/documents/e03d88c8-f64a-407b-bb7f-0594f2460faf/view\" rel=\"noopener\">attached</a> <a href=\"https://www.riveroaks-capital.com/fund-overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) – only ~50-75 of the roughly 3,000 publicly traded, small, underfollowed companies universe checks all the boxes of a wonderful business.</p> <p>This raises the obvious question that is often ask to me: why would any small company stay public, paying $1–2m+ per year for the \"privilege\" of being 50% undervalued?</p> <p>I used to give a long winded, ten-minute answer – often addressing how many of these companies went public well before the cost of being public drastically increased and alternative forms of capital raising weren't available.</p> <p>However, I was recently having a conversation with an investor friend of mine, and he cut straight to the chase: <em>\"Who cares? If they hadn't gone public, we couldn't buy them this cheap.\"</em></p> <p>When nearly every investor ignores this universe, even the wonderful businesses get thrown out with the bathwater. That neglect is our opportunity to buy wonderful businesses at an extremely discounted valuation.</p> <p>This is where the evolution of 'rolling up my sleeves' began.</p> <p>The first 1-2 years of running River Oaks Capital: Finding the Gems</p> <p>Early on, rolling up my sleeves meant getting on planes, meeting management teams in person, visiting competitors, attending conferences – the boots-on-the-groundwork required to find the handful of genuinely undervalued small, wonderful underfollowed public companies.</p> <p>I soon discovered I was conducting rigorous due diligence that few perform in this area of the market.</p> <p>I applied the same due diligence I would conduct before acquiring a 50% stake in a local private business – why should a small publicly traded company warrant a different approach?</p> <p>The next few years: Actively Taking Advantage of Their Undervaluation</p> <p>A few years in, I realized finding an undervalued small, wonderful, underfollowed business public company wasn't enough.</p> <p>No light switch was going to flip these companies to fair value on their own.</p> <p>So, each time I visit the management teams of almost every company we own, I give a rather simple suggestion to buy back as many shares as possible – using free cash flow from the business, cash on the balance sheet, and proceeds from non-core asset sales. Rather than getting frustrated over the undervaluation, let's take advantage of it.</p> <p>Ideally, we buy ownership in wonderful companies who are already doing this (a handful of the companies we own already were).</p> <p>However, many of the companies we own that previously had not implemented a share buyback program started one after the suggestion from myself alongside other shareholders.</p> <p>The case to be made to management teams is quite simple: if your stock trades at 50 cents on the dollar, buying back shares can turn $1 into $2. There is no other area of the market that offers this easy of a capital allocation decision.</p> <p>This approach allows us to be adequately compensated – 8–15%+ returns per year –until the company becomes properly valued.</p> <p>The past year: The Part I'd Never Deeply Thought About</p> <p>I'd thought carefully about how we find these companies.</p> <p>I'd thought carefully how they should allocate capital until the company becomes properly valued.</p> <p>What I realized I hadn't deeply thought about was the \"until the company becomes properly valued\" part. How will that eventually happen? Does it even need to happen if you are returning capital to shareholders at above average returns?</p> <p>This was crystallized when we started buying ownership in Ascent Industries in the second half of the year.</p> <p>I flew out to Chicago to meet CEO Brian Kitchen who opened my eyes to something I'd been realizing for years without ever fully identifying it: the importance of investing alongside management teams that not only have an unwavering long-term value creation plan but also actively work to <em>manifest </em>fair – or ideally premium – returns for patient shareholders.</p> <p>Looking back, every one of our successful investments has this quality.</p> <p>In many ways, this isn't a departure from what I've always focused on: finding a wonderful business with an A+ management team that reinvests excess free cash flow into high-return areas while repurchasing shares opportunistically.</p> <p>However, it goes further, integrating a clear long-term business plan with maximum shareholder value creation.</p> <p><em>In small, underfollowed public markets – where price discovery keeps shrinking – a long-term shareholder value creation plan matters more than ever.</em></p> <p>Over my career, I've found only four long term value creation strategies that reliably work – which I will outline below using a company we own as an example for each.</p> <p>They aren't mutually exclusive; The best companies often execute multiple of these strategies across various stages of long-term value creation.</p> <p>However, a key requirement is that the business sustains above-average shareholder returns throughout the process, as long-term plans often exceed expected timelines – you don't want time to be your enemy.</p> <p>Strategy 1: Grow your way out of being small and underfollowed – BuildDirect (BILD.V)</p> <p>The long-term objective of a company using this maximum shareholder value business plan is to go after an underfollowed, fragmented market and grow the business through both organic growth and acquisitions to no longer be a small, underfollowed public company.</p> <p>With proper execution and prudent capital allocation, they can grow large enough that the benefits of being a public company noticeably outweigh the negatives.</p> <p>Shawn Wilson – CEO of BuildDirect– and his team have laid out this exact plan that entails a 10+ year methodical execution to grow their business to 75+ professional flooring stores across the U.S. through organic growth and acquisitions.</p> <p>If they achieve this while using prudent capital allocation – more on how they have done so far in the following section – Shawn and his team will grow their free cash flow to over $50m+ per year in 10 years with no plans to stop there.</p> <p>Their ultimate goal is to become North America's largest professional flooring company – a path that would almost certainly manifest the highest possible value for patient, long-term shareholders.</p> <p>Critically, they're funding this growth through free cash flow from the business and prudent debt – not having to issue additional equity along the way.</p> <p>Relying on your share price to fund acquisitions or organic growth carries significant risk – persistent mispricing can result in substantial dilution to long-term shareholders</p> <p>This strategy can also be implemented through a holding company that gathers together a select number of unrelated small, underfollowed companies to create a larger parent company – which is being executed at Boston Omaha now.</p> <p>Here, management's capital allocation is imperative, as you will need to overcome the hurdle of parent holding company costs.</p> <p>Strategy 2: Dominate a niche market and become an irresistible acquisition target – Ascent Industries (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACNT\" title=\"Ascent Industries Co.\">ACNT</a>)</p> <p>This long-term business plan maximizes shareholder value by dominating a niche within a broader market, positioning the company as an attractive acquisition target for major industry players.</p> <p>As the major players – larger strategic acquirers or private equity firms – look to expand their footprint in the broader industry, they will eventually be attracted to the niche area you have cornered.</p> <p>CEO Brian Kitchen and his Ascent team are building dominance in a niche area of specialty chemicals that major players have left untouched.</p> <p>Brian and his team have executed this strategy before at a different company and remain laser focused on doing so again.</p> <p>Each of Brian's presentations clearly illustrates free cash flow before and after public company costs, providing a transparent view of standalone value available to a strategic or financial acquirer, excluding synergies.</p> <p>The logic writes itself: it's cheaper for a major player to acquire a dominant niche player like Ascent Industries than spend the time, money and resources to compete against them head-on.</p> <p>To reiterate, the business must generate above-average investor returns in the interim, as an acquisition may take years or decades.</p> <p>Strategy 3: Divest the entire business to unlock the trapped shareholder value – Medical Facilities (DR.TO)</p> <p>Sometimes the long-term plan that maximizes shareholder value is to admit you are better off selling the company piece by piece and returning capital to shareholders via a mixture of share buybacks and dividends.</p> <p>Counterintuitively, long-term shareholders benefit most when the share price remains undervalued during the divestiture process, enabling management to maximize accretive share buybacks prior to the final cash distribution.</p> <p>Around three years ago, activist investors stepped in at Medical Facilities, as the prior management's acquisition strategy wasn't working. Their stock price reflected as much.</p> <p>Jason Redman was appointed CEO with a mandate to divest non-core assets and then the four core surgical hospitals – two of which are best-in-class facilities whose value was buried within a broader hospital conglomerate.</p> <p>Jason and his team have now divested of all their non-core assets and sold two of their four surgical hospitals – with the sale of the final two most likely to happen in the near term.</p> <p>They have methodically returned the cash generated from each sale back to shareholders by buying back undervalued shares and paying dividends when appropriate.</p> <p>They have put on a master class on how to execute the strategy of divesting your entire business to unlock maximum value for long-term shareholders.</p> <p>Strategy 4: Cut costs to a bare minimum and run like a private company – Truxton Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TRUX\" title=\"Truxton Corporation\">TRUX</a>)</p> <p>The fourth long-term value maximizing strategy is perfectly outlined by Truxton Trust.</p> <p>CEO Tom Stumb and his team have kept public company costs to well below $500k per year – they have been extremely cost discipline since they went public more than 20 years ago.</p> <p>They are listed on the lowest cost tier of the <a href=\"https://www.otcmarkets.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OTC Markets</a> and don't allocate their time towards quarterly calls, investor conferences, or roadshows. Instead focusing all their attention on operating and growing their wonderful business.</p> <p>Tom and his team have operated with the efficiency of a private company due to their large insider ownership at Truxton and the trust gained from their tightly held long-term shareholder base over the past two decades.</p> <p>Additionally, how their shares are valued has no effect on their long-term business plans because they generate such an excess amount of free cash flow per year, they never plan on having to use their share price to raise money.</p> <p>Furthermore, long-term investors don't care where the stock price is as Tom and his team have been growing free cash flow at 15%+ per year – positioning us to make above average returns just from the yearly cash distributions from the company.</p> <p>The final result is a perfect balance: they operate with the efficiency of a private company while retaining the genuine benefits of being public – credibility with borrowers and depositors, share liquidity for employees and clients, and the ongoing ability to buy back undervalued shares.</p> <p><em>Worth Noting: This strategy typically requires significant insider ownership, as small companies with low management ownership tend to waste considerable time and resources on investor </em><em>relations, consulting, and other unnecessary expenses.</em></p> <p>The strategy that ties them all together – FitLife (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FTLF\" title=\"FitLife Brands, Inc.\">FTLF</a>)</p> <p>No letter I write is complete without mentioning Dayton Judd and FitLife – and for good reason.</p> <p>Since taking over as CEO in 2018, Dayton has been deliberate in executing multiple of the strategies listed above at various stages of his long-term plan to maximize shareholder value, growing the market cap from ~$5m to now ~$150m.</p> <p>He began by slashing 60% of costs – including public company costs – and running FitLife like a private company with all his time allocated towards fixing and growing the business (buying back ~5% of highly undervalued shares too).</p> <p>This was largely made possible because he had majority ownership of the company, and any long-term shareholder who engaged with Dayton recognized him as exceptionally trustworthy and a best-in-class CEO.</p> <p>He then grew the company out of underfollowed territory by acquiring multiple complementary nutrition brands purchased at distressed multiples of 3–5x earnings and cutting their bloated costs alongside layering in synergies at each step.</p> <p>Dayton and his team will continue to run this playbook in the future as more acquisitions come their way.</p> <p>Their long-term plan that maximizes shareholder value – laid out in 2018 – is now methodically coming to life.</p> <p>He has assembled a conglomerate of complementary brands large enough for a strategic acquirer to pay 12–15x earnings or more – that will only get larger and more valuable as his acquisition playbook continues.</p> <p>All the while, public costs have remained at $600K per year or below – even after uplisting to the NASDAQ – and the business generates 15–20%+ returns on capital as we wait.</p> <p>Since 2018, Dayton has given us a clear and concise example of how a long-term plan that maximizes shareholder value is brought to life.</p> <blockquote><p>If you don't know where you are going, you'll end up someplace else. — Yogi Berra</p></blockquote> <p>The next chapter of 'rolling up my sleeves' is this: thoroughly understanding each company's long-term shareholder value creation strategy prior to acquiring ownership.</p> <p>For a tiny portion of the companies we currently own that don't seem to have a long-term strategy in place, I have a clear plan to fly out and make a simple pitch on the necessity to have one.</p> <p>However, all in all, the companies we own have been wonderful stewards of our capital.</p> <p>In total, a company that passively awaits market recognition – rather than proactively creating its own strategy for the highest possible return for investors – is failing to reckon with an undeniable reality. Price discovery in small, underfollowed public markets may not improve.</p> <p>The companies that will reward patient shareholders are the ones that stop waiting to be found and start building something that will eventually be impossible to ignore.</p> <p>The rigorous in person due diligence and the active pitch for buying back shares will of course still be at the core of River Oaks Capital's investment strategy. We have now just added a third dimension.</p> <p>This represents a significant opportunity for River Oaks Capital, as we have identified a clear pathway to generating above-average returns through small, underfollowed public companies, regardless of the broader market efficiency.</p> <hr> <p>River Oaks Capital puts in the necessary 'time requirement' to find the few undiscovered gems in a forest left for dead.</p> <p><em>Part of that 'time requirement' over this past year included traveling to:</em></p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-1772239805547915_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"948\" data-height=\"513\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-1772239805547915_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"A map of the United States with orange dots indicating travel locations.

Companies added in the Past Year</h2> <h3>Ascent Industries (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACNT\" title=\"Ascent Industries Co.\">ACNT</a>)</h3> <p>Ascent Industries is specialty chemical manufacturer. It is the seventh largest position in our fund and has a $150m market cap.</p> <p>Founded in 1945, Ascent Industries began as a special chemical manufacturing business but spent decades diversifying into stainless steel, fiberglass tanks, and pipe &amp; tubing.</p> <p>Years of mismanagement under an operationally inexperienced team left the stock flat for nearly two decades, burdened by rising debt, declining earnings, and bloated corporate costs.</p> <p>This also resulted in no strategic direction for each operating business and no ability to gain economies of scale with each additional acquisition – this became quite evident as capital allocation was getting materially worse each step of the way.</p> <p>That changed in 2020, when activists Ben Rosensweig (Privet Fund) and Chris Hutter ('UPG') replaced management.

however, their primary focus is on \"quality margin business,\" which predominantly falls within the 'product sales' category.</p> <p>Another issue identified was that, prior to Brian's team's involvement, the business lacked visibility into the markets and applications in which their customers were using its specialty chemical products for.</p> <p>They uncovered that Ascent was producing an excessive number of specialty chemical products across hundreds of markets.</p> <p>So, Brian and his team simplified their specialty chemicals end market customers: Oil &amp;

High-return, low risk growth investments within the existing asset base (equipment, salespeople, etc.).</p> <p>2. Share buybacks – they recently authorized buying back ~20% of their shares over the next two years, on top of the 7%+ already repurchased in the first three quarters of 2025.</p> <p>3. Disciplined acquisitions of profitable, well run specialty chemical businesses with $0–25m of EBITDA with unique, proprietary chemical products that help fill the remaining capacity at their manufacturing facilities – they are not looking for a turnaround project.</p> <p><em>Note: #2 &amp; #3 are of equal priority</em></p> <h2><em>The Growth Opportunity &amp; Valuation</em></h2> <p>Ascent's three well-maintained manufacturing facilities in Tennessee, South Carolina, and Virginia currently operate below 50% utilization, with minimal capex requirements of $1-3m annually across all sites.</p> <p>This means significant revenue growth requires no additional facility investment.</p> <p>Brian and his team's near-term plan is to grow revenue from ~$80m to $130m+, representing ~80% capacity utilization.</p> <p>With the fixed-cost base largely covered, incremental revenue flows heavily to the bottom line. At ~80% utilization, with gross margins expanding to 35%+ (as the revenue shifts toward higher margin 'product sales') and SG&amp;A at ~15% of sales, EBITDA margins should reach 18–20%, or $23–26m+ of EBITDA per year – generating $17–20m+ of free cash flow to equity, a 14–17+% free cash flow to equity yield (6-7 P/E) in the near term at the current market cap (adjusting for cash<sup>*</sup>).</p> <p>This near-term target appears increasingly achievable following the company's recent announcements of <a href=\"https://ir.ascentco.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/271/ascent-industries-announces-10m-program-advancing\" rel=\"nofollow\">$10m in new annual recurring revenue</a> and the lease of its previously idle Munhall, Pennsylvania site, generating <a href=\"https://ir.ascentco.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/270/ascent-industries-eliminates-2-1m-in-costs-further\" rel=\"nofollow\">$2.1m in annual cost savings</a> .</p> <p>Additionally, we are investing alongside Brian and his team, who possess a proven turnaround track record and a long-term value creation strategy – as mentioned in the opening section – that positions the company to become an undeniably attractive acquisition target.</p> <p>As shown in <a href=\"chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_5cb58ad7ca2fb270e6706f8f6b780a15/ascentco/db/2552/24150/pdf/ACNT+IR_iAccess+Alpha+Virtual+Best+Ideas+Winter+Investment+Conference+2025_Final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this presentation</a> , public costs are itemized to highlight immediately strippable expenses for a strategic acquirer, excluding synergies.</p> <p>All in all, at current ~50% capacity utilization, Ascent offers an attractive ~9-10% free cash flow to equity yield (10-11 P/E ratio) with meaningful upside potential as the business scales, while its ~$60m of cash on the balance sheet provides capital allocation optionality and downside protection.</p> <p>While an acquisition is not necessary for us to generate above-average returns, Ascent Industries – once operating near full capacity – would be conservatively worth 70%+ more than its current market cap to a large specialty chemicals manufacturer.</p> <h3>BuildDirect (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BILD:CA\" title=\"BuildDirect.com Technologies Inc.\">BILD:CA</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BDCTF\" title=\"BuildDirect.com Technologies Inc.\">BDCTF</a>)</h3> <p>BuildDirect is a physical and online professional flooring company with locations throughout the U.S and one in Canada.

about Shawn is his intense discipline towards prudent capital allocation – despite a long-term plan to significantly grow the business – he's methodically growing BuildDirect to generate superior returns for us long-term investors, not just for the sake of growing.</p> <h2>Recent Acquisition</h2> <p>BuildDirect recently acquired <a href=\"https://www.datalab.to/playground/documents/e03d88c8-f64a-407b-bb7f-0594f2460faf/view\" rel=\"nofollow\">Greyn Custom Wood</a> , an established online flooring marketplace with a strong presence in major retailers' (Home Depot, Lowe's, Menards, etc.) e-commerce channels alongside a professional center in South Carolina, for $450k – approximately 1.25x EBITDA on $6m in revenue and ~$320k in EBITDA.</p> <p>The acquisition is strategically compelling for us investors for three reasons.</p> <p>First, it provides immediate access to big-box retailers' online marketplaces – a footprint that would have been costly and time-consuming to build organically.</p> <p>Second, BuildDirect can significantly reduce Greyne's fulfillment costs by routing orders through BuildDirect's now 10 professional centers, replacing the third-party warehousing Greyne previously relied upon.</p> <p>Third, there are multiple opportunities to cross-sell.</p> <p>Shawn and his team can leverage Greyne's existing retailer relationships to introduce BuildDirect's products, while integrating Greyne's catalog into BuildDirect's physical and e-commerce channels – creating a clear path to revenue growth.</p> <p>Based on the above, using conservative estimates, BuildDirect could add $3m+ in incremental revenue and $400k in annual cost savings to Greyne, allowing the acquisition to generate $800k–$1m in free cash flow to equity per year.</p> <h2><em>Acquiring versus Building</em></h2> <p>Over the past two quarters, a slower acquisition pace has enabled Shawn's team to assess the merits of acquiring versus building professional centers.</p> <p>The conclusion is clear: the preferred method for growing from 10 to 75+ professional centers is via acquisitions.</p> <p>The Orlando center, acquired for <sup>~$600k*</sup> at 1–1.5x EBITDA on $5–6m in revenue, is on track to achieve 15–20% revenue growth and EBITDA margins of 12–15% in its first year – a strong outcome driven by ERP integration, procurement savings, and targeted marketing toward professional flooring customers.</p> <p><img

<p>Exterior view of a BuildDirect Wholesale Flooring professional center, featuring a red metal frame and a white building with the company logo.</p> <p>By contrast, the Los Angeles greenfield professional center, built for <sup>~$500K*</sup>, is projected to take up to five years to reach $5m in revenue – the level Orlando achieved on day one.</p> <p>The Los Angeles center has, however, meaningfully reduced west-coast fulfillment costs for the e-commerce business.</p> <p>Going forward, management will focus on acquiring established, single-digit EBITDA margin 'fixer upper' mom-and-pop professional flooring centers and improving them to 12–15% margins without additional capital investment.</p> <p>Shawn and his team have been able to structure their acquisitions at or below the value of inventory plus net working capital – providing us investors significant downside protection.</p> <p>With approximately 15,000 independent professional flooring centers in the market, the pipeline of opportunity remains substantial.</p> <p>Management is confident it can add 7–10 professional centers per year, though Shawn and his team will only do so on terms that represent sound capital allocation.</p> <p>Furthermore, if there is an area of the U.S they want to penetrate but doesn't have a professional flooring center for sale – or for sale at a reasonable valuation – they still have no problem building one on their own and recruiting top-tier local talent.</p> <p>From a big picture standpoint, the flooring industry has experienced a prolonged downturn, driven by persistently weak housing turnover – the sector's primary health indicator – resulting in below-historical-norm acquisition prices as mom-and-pop professional centers are facing significant financial pressure.</p> <p>A more conservative assumption would be that during normal times, acquiring a local mom and pop professional center would cost 2–3x EBITDA (before synergies), which would be ~2–3x more expensive than building a greenfield professional center of the same size.</p> <p>Nonetheless, regardless of economic conditions, the preferred growth method for Shawn and his team is through acquisitions.</p> <h2><em>BuildDirect.com</em></h2> <p>Recall that when Shawn took over as CEO, he shrunk their money-losing e-commerce business down from $30m–$40m of revenue per year to $15m.</p> <p>Under the leadership of Jay Allen, their e-commerce site is now profitable again and should generate ~$18m of revenue this year.</p> <p>The team plans on slowly growing their e-commerce site – by only re-investing the cash generated by the e-commerce division – to a $25–$35m revenue business with a 15–20% operating margin in the near term.</p> <p>This is all due to the wonderful overhaul Jay Allen has executed – details of how he did so are mentioned in the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f1TfjtPcidYW-DsdsfUcgYTKqQ8EvUqc/view\" rel=\"noopener\">previous letter</a>.</p> <h4><em>Valuation</em></h4> <p>River Oaks Capital's ownership was acquired through a private offering extended to us by Shawn and his team when BuildDirect had a $35m market cap.</p> <p>At a $90m market cap, the margin of safety is lower than when we bought ownership; however, my deeper understanding of management's capital allocation discipline and the long-term value creation Shawn and his team are in the midst of executing has strengthened my confidence that downside protection remains adequate while the upside potential is significantly more than I initially realized.</p> <p>Post the Greyne acquisition, BuildDirect should generate ~$80m in annualized revenue with $7–8m in EBITDA, converting to $4–5m+ in near-term free cash flow to equity.</p> <p>The company has ~$8m in cash on the balance sheet, and its favorable RBC credit facility (prime + 1–1.5%) enables ~60% debt financing on acquisitions.</p> <p>With their current access to liquidity, management can acquire an estimated 15 additional professional centers over the next 2–3 years, adding $75m+ in revenue.</p> <p>Combined with e-commerce growth, this positions BuildDirect as a ~$165m revenue business generating $17–20m in EBITDA and $12–14m in free cash flow to equity in the next 2-3 years – implying a 13–15% free cash flow yield (6-8 P/E ratio) and a pathway to self-funded growth toward their goal of 75 professional centers in 10 years (never having to issue shares again).</p> <p>While the 2–3 year projection carries a lot of “ifs”, Shawn and his team have established a proven framework that has already delivered strong returns for us investors.</p> <p>I will continue to check in with Shawn and his team to monitor their progress; however, if they continue executing acquisitions like Orlando and Greyne Custom Wood – both projected to have one-year paybacks (100% return on capital) – a $90m market cap appears to be a reasonable valuation</p> <p>It has been a pleasure investing alongside Shawn and his team.</p> <hr> <h2>III.

I have purchased ownership based on a convincing growth narrative before any real progress was reflected in the financials.</p> <p>2. I have done so at valuations that have already priced in a meaningful portion of the growth story.</p> <p>This brings to mind a principle I have applied since founding River Oaks Capital – Warren Buffett's \"Rule No. 1: Never lose money. Rule No. 2: Never forget Rule No. 1.\"</p> <p>In these instances, I've failed to fully consider downside protection – specifically, not considering the valuation implications if the growth story never materializes.</p> <p>There is nothing inherently wrong with investing in a 'wonderful business' on the cusp of material growth, provided it is value accretive.</p> <p>The discipline, however, lies in buying only when two conditions are met:</p> <p>1. The growth story is beginning to appear in the financials yet remains largely unrecognized by the market.</p> <p>2. The valuation is low enough on current earnings that the investment is sound regardless of whether growth materializes.</p> <p>These opportunities are rare, but rigorous in-person due diligence — particularly in small, underfollowed public markets — can uncover them.</p> <p>Whether pursuing ‘wonderful businesses’ or ‘excessive discounts’, my approach has always been rooted in value investing, and my mistakes have often occurred when I have drifted from that discipline.</p> <p><strong>Best,</strong></p> <p><strong>Whit Huguley, CFA</strong></p> <p> </p> <hr> <p> </p> <h4>References</h4> <ol> <li>TR = Total Return (dividends reinvested)</li> <li>Overly conservative assumption that $30m of cash will be needed to help fill capacity</li> <li>Recall from the previous letter: whether building or buying, they are leasing the 20,000 to 30,000 square foot warehouse, so that isn't factored into the upfront costs (which is a risk I will monitor).</li> </ol> <p></p> <hr> <p> </p> <div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td> <p></p> <p>Contact Us</p> <p>River Oaks CapitalWhit Huguley, CFA<em>Portfolio Manager</em></p> <p>River Oaks Capitalwhuguley@riveroaks-capital.com(504) 913-3388</p> <p></p> </td></tr></tbody></table>\n<span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button>\n</div> <hr> <p><a href=\"https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=1hduRdoB57jtrW5pDbjgOLlkp-c-W19Vp&amp;export=download&amp;authuser=0\" rel=\"noopener noopener\"><strong>Original Post</strong></a> </p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder\"></div><p><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.<a href=\"blob:https://2vtaojjlbdml2ka53utuv82tr7xfagovem04ofd2im8y6zfvt4-h874623575.scf.usercontent.goog/d0887089-7de9-43da-bd64-001c62870d32#\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> </p>",

However, in Micron's case, it is the exact opposite, as it has been one of the key beneficiaries of the historic AI infrastructure boom led and funded by hyperscalers like Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>), Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), and Oracle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The massive rally in the share prices of the Big 3 memory manufacturers says it all, with SK Hynix leading the way, followed by Micron and Samsung Electronics in third place. On an equally weighted basis, we are talking about a ~345% return delivered by the industry over the last year. In contrast, an equally weighted basket of the SaaS companies mentioned above delivered a disastrous performance of roughly -40% over the same period. From this perspective, I view the SaaS and DRAM markets as two extremes within the overall AI trade, as two polar opposites. One is characterized by widespread pessimism and rapidly declining share prices, while elevated expectations and record-high share prices characterize the other.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60900905-17721593494727128_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"855\" data-height=\"565\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60900905-17721593494727128_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Big 3 Memory Manufacturers Relative Performance\" width=\"640\" height=\"423\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"423\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60900905-17721593494727128_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60900905-17721593494727128_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60900905-17721593494727128_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60900905-17721593494727128_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Big 3 Memory Manufacturers Relative Performance <span>(Google Finance, David Desjardins)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this tale of two markets, where is the best place to deploy capital for the medium to long term? My 'Strong Buy' ratings on multiple SaaS companies and my 'Sell' rating on Micron say a lot about my stance on the topic. In the middle of those two poles, we find the large hyperscalers, with Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle having delivered a market return of +14.5% on an equally weighted basis over the last twelve months. And talking about high expectations, Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) reported stellar financial results for the <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2026\" rel=\"nofollow\">fourth quarter of fiscal 2026</a>, but its share price still dropped by -5.46% on the day following the earnings release.

Primarily due to the rapidly growing demand for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Bandwidth_Memory\" rel=\"nofollow\">high-bandwidth memory</a> used in artificial intelligence applications, Micron's DRAM revenue increased from $6.4 billion in Q1-FY25 to $10.8 billion in Q1-FY26, a whopping year-over-year increase of almost 70%. As memory manufacturers diverted production capacity toward the highly lucrative HBM market, the supply of conventional DRAM has also tightened, pushing prices higher across the board.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60900905-17721630555043085_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1234\" data-height=\"454\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60900905-17721630555043085_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Micron's Revenue By Technology\" width=\"640\" height=\"235\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"235\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60900905-17721630555043085_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60900905-17721630555043085_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60900905-17721630555043085_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/60900905-17721630555043085_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Micron's Revenue By Technology <span>(Q1-26 Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As mentioned earlier in this article, the DRAM market is well-known for its deeply cyclical behavior and abrupt market turns. At the end of the day, DRAM is a commodity that goes from periods of oversupply to periods of shortages, as is the case today. There is no question that the DRAM market is in shortage today, but the real question is how long will it remain so?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4868828-micron-technology-inc-mu-presents-at-wolfe-research-auto-auto-tech-and-semiconductor\">recent comments</a> made by Micron's CFO, <a href=\"https://www.micron.com/about/company/leadership/mark-murphy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mark Murphy</a>, supply is expected to remain tight beyond 2026, with the company committed to meeting market demand over time. In other words, DRAM supply is indeed very tight at the moment, but Micron and the industry as a whole are committed to meeting market demand, and that's the key point here. In my view, the DRAM market is currently in a lag phase, where market demand has increased dramatically while supply has not responded in a significant manner yet.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Demand is significantly higher than our ability to supply and the industry's ability to supply. We continue to expect supply/demand to be tight beyond '26. We are doing everything we can to plan and invest appropriately for our customers' needs over time. We are preparing clean room space that will come online over time, and that will give us the ability to grow our bit supply in line with market demand.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-17721756511775959_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"660\" data-height=\"472\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-17721756511775959_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DRAM &amp; HBM Average Selling Price\" width=\"640\" height=\"458\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"458\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-17721756511775959_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-17721756511775959_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-17721756511775959_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-17721756511775959_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">DRAM &amp; HBM Average Selling Price <span>(S&amp;P Global)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the chart below, DRAM prices have historically behaved in cycles lasting approximately 4 years on average. Because it takes some time for the industry to build additional production capacity after a surge in demand, every one of the last four cycles has been characterized by a spike in prices. After a certain time, supply ultimately enters the market, shortages are alleviated, and DRAM prices drop from their cyclical peak. The cycle is then over, and prices may go well below production costs for a while before a new cycle starts. This is pretty similar to what happens in other deeply cyclical industries like oil &amp; gas, mining, or maritime shipping, for example. One key difference is that DRAM cycles are relatively short and notorious for their abrupt turns, as DRAM production can ramp up much faster than some other commodities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-17721758206633_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"973\" data-height=\"406\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-17721758206633_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"DRAM Historical Prices\" width=\"640\" height=\"267\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"267\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-17721758206633_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-17721758206633_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-17721758206633_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-17721758206633_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">DRAM Historical Prices <span>(DramxChange, Morgan Stanley Research)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interestingly enough, I have recently written an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865452-silver-the-opportunity-of-a-violent-market-crash\">article on silver</a> with a 'Strong Buy' rating. This is another industry dealing with severe shortages, but in contrast to DRAM, silver's supply function is highly inelastic, meaning that higher demand does not necessarily trigger a commensurate response in supply. Given the tens of billions collectively invested by the Big 3 memory manufacturers to bring on additional supply, it is my belief that DRAM supply will ultimately meet demand. However, it is my personal opinion that the same argument cannot be made for silver, and all the difference is there. Both industries are facing shortages, but both have completely different supply responses. In DRAM's case, manufacturers are already investing massively to ramp up supply, while it is far from being so in the silver market. While market participants are currently focused on the historical DRAM demand surge, this very focus could gradually shift to the supply response, which could also be historic.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>As a reminder, silver is primarily mined as a byproduct of gold, copper, lead, and zinc mines, meaning that movements in silver prices alone are unlikely to change the economics of those assets. This is the core reason behind silver's inelastic supply response, or why higher silver prices are unlikely to have a meaningful impact on supply.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additional HBM Supply Is Coming Online Soon</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, Micron officially started the construction of a <a href=\"https://investors.micron.com/static-files/8245e3e3-8197-4ff9-a7e6-245f992518bb\" rel=\"noopener\">$100 billion</a> semiconductor manufacturing facility in January 2026. This megafab, located in the state of New York, represents one of the largest private investments in the history of the United States and will bring significant supply to market once it reaches production in 2030.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For Micron, the New York megafab is only half of its overall capital projects, as the company plans to invest a total of <a href=\"https://investors.micron.com/static-files/c15e30fb-3f59-4216-b2ed-f42b38640530\" rel=\"noopener\">$200 billion</a>, including the construction of two additional fabs in Idaho, as well as the expansion and modernization of its existing manufacturing facilities in Virginia. The first fab in Idaho is expected to reach production in mid-calendar 2027, with the second one supposed to come online before the end of 2028. As mentioned above, this will be followed by the mega-fab in New York entering into production sometime around 2030. We can already see how the DRAM supply picture will change over the next few years, although I fully agree that it does little to alleviate the shortages found in the present moment. Micron's CFO summarized the situation pretty well at the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4868828-micron-technology-inc-mu-presents-at-wolfe-research-auto-auto-tech-and-semiconductor\">Wolfe Research Semiconductor Conference</a> held in mid-February 2026:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We have incremental greenfield capacity coming online in mid-2027 with Idaho 1. This Tongluo acquisition, we will be able to provide some supply near the end of 2027, going into 2028. And then we have Idaho 2, which will be beyond that. And so the point is that supply is coming on, but it takes a long time to bring it on because it's greenfield.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, those capital plans are only for Micron, which is the smallest player among the Big 3 memory manufacturers. So what is going on with Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix? Can we observe a similar pattern?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at SK Hynix, we find that the company is currently building its Yongin Fab in South Korea, with the company having just announced <a href=\"https://news.skhynix.com/new-facility-investment-for-yongin-semiconductor-cluster/\" rel=\"nofollow\">$15.0 billion</a> of additional investment in the project and accelerating the time to first production to February 2027. On Samsung Electronics' side, the story is pretty much the same, with the company speeding up construction of its <a href=\"https://www.cleanroomtechnology.com/samsung-speeds-up-construction-of-p5-cleanroom-for\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pyeongtaek Fab 5</a>, also in South Korea.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, starting in early to mid-2027, additional HBM production capacity is forecasted to enter the market, which should help alleviate the current shortages. In this context, how should investors think about the sustainability of Micron's outsized profitability at the moment? If significant production capacity is expected to enter the market before the end of the decade, what are the implications for Micron's valuation?</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Micron generated operating cash flows of $8.4 billion, while capital expenditures amounted to $5.4 billion. Including $878 million of proceeds from government incentives, we are talking about a free cash flow generation of $3.9 billion in Q1-FY26 alone, or the equivalent of $15.6 billion on an annualized basis. While this sounds great, it is important to remind ourselves that it is relative to Micron's current market capitalization of $467.7 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-1772223423625769_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1230\" data-height=\"418\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-1772223423625769_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Micron's Q1-26 Free Cash Flows\" width=\"640\" height=\"217\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"217\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-1772223423625769_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-1772223423625769_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-1772223423625769_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-1772223423625769_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Micron's Q1-26 Free Cash Flows <span>(Q1-26 Report)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite record financial performance, we are still talking about a free cash flow yield of only ~3.3%, meaning it would take just over 30 years for an investor to recoup the equivalent of MU's current market capitalization using the free cash flows generated in Q1-FY26. As discussed in the previous section, significant DRAM and HBM production capacity is forecast to come online by 2030, which will meaningfully alter the industry's supply and demand balance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's say that Micron has five more years of outsized profitability ahead before the cycle turns downward with all the additional capacity coming up. What happens after that? After all, Micron's manufacturing base will now be much larger, meaning that fixed costs will also be much higher in absolute terms. Operating a global semiconductor manufacturing business comes with a cost base that is relatively fixed in nature, which is why utilization rates are so important in this industry. Operating near maximum capacity, as is the case today, is the best way to amortize the fixed costs and generate strong profitability. However, when the cycle turns, the operating leverage that was beneficial during the upswing becomes detrimental in the downswing. It works both ways.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The good news is that Micron's balance sheet is now in a $260 million net cash position, and this should continue to get even better over the next few quarters as I expect the company's record profitability to continue until at least the end of 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-17722251704951863_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1227\" data-height=\"244\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-17722251704951863_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Micron Net Cash Position\" width=\"640\" height=\"127\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"127\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-17722251704951863_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-17722251704951863_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-17722251704951863_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60900905-17722251704951863_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Micron Net Cash Position <span>(Q1-26 Report)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The worst-case scenario for Micron would be for the DRAM and HBM cycle to turn at the very moment when the capital expenditures associated with the new fabs in the United States are starting to materialize. The DRAM industry has shown investors time and time again that record-high profitability cannot be extrapolated far off into the future, as it can evaporate as fast as it appeared. Don't get me wrong, I think HBM demand growth is structural in nature, but what is not structural is the lag in supply we have witnessed so far.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk Factor</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, the biggest risk associated with my 'Sell' rating relates to timing. The DRAM market is currently experiencing severe shortages, and additional production capacity is not expected to enter production until early to mid-2027. This means that Micron may continue to benefit from extreme market conditions for a little longer. If DRAM prices continue to surge higher, this could lead to another leg up on Micron's share price by the end of 2026. If it does happen, I will be more than happy to write an update on the story to see if a 'Strong Sell' rating is not warranted this time around.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Everyone now knows about the DRAM and HBM shortages. To use an analogy for the hockey legend Wayne Gretzky, skate to where the puck is going, not where it has been. Shortages are where the puck is today, but ramping up supply is where the puck is going. It is a matter of timing here, and I truly believe that timing is one of the most difficult elements to work with in financial markets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My 'Sell' rating is primarily based on the deeply cyclical nature of the DRAM market. Micron is currently trading at a ~3.3% free cash flow yield, and that is using the record profitability reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2026. At the current valuation, investors will need decades of outsized profitability to recoup their investments, not just a few years, as I believe it may indeed be the case. This is why I say that Micron's cyclical growth is priced as if it were structural, and that's where I see a large gap between the historical behavior of the DRAM market and what is currently priced by the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What if the nature of the DRAM market has changed permanently with the arrival of artificial intelligence and its associated need for HBM memory? In such a scenario, Micron's current market capitalization of $467.7 billion may be more justifiable, but please remember that every single memory upswing was also accompanied by its own narrative about why things were different this time. The fact of the matter is that significant additional capacity is forecasted to come online by 2030, which could leave Micron with just a few years left of record profitability, instead of the decades required to justify the current valuation.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTCH\" title=\"Match Group, Inc.\">MTCH</a></span>) portfolio is sufficiently diversified and dominant in the dating app industry to offset declining users across several of its apps. I believe the market is misunderstanding how popular Tinder<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> is, its global reach and its penetration of younger users. Despite several catalysts for Tinder, the market is still pricing in a 27% annual decline over the next five years. Hinge is the fastest-growing dating app, and Bumble Inc.

Hinge contributes about 20% of revenue and 16% of OI. So basically, Tinder and Hinge drive ~94% of Match Group's operating income. This says two things, first of all that its other two segments, E&amp;E and MG Asia, despite comprising 17% and 8% of revenue, their margins are low enough that they contribute very little to the bottom line. Second, it explains why the market is so sensitive to Tinder's decline, which I'll show more clearly later in the DCF. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720358313322456_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2129\" data-height=\"949\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720358313322456_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Hinge KPI's\" width=\"640\" height=\"285\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720358313322456_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720358313322456_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720358313322456_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720358313322456_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>MTCH 10K </span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720357431841855_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1474\" data-height=\"1309\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720357431841855_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"E&amp;E and MG Asia KPIs\" width=\"640\" height=\"568\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720357431841855_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720357431841855_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720357431841855_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720357431841855_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>MTCH 10K </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a levered FCF margin of 24% and an ROA of 17.67%, it is clear the business is efficient and generating cash.

In 2025, about 117% of UFCF was returned through buybacks and dividends. its has reduced its diluted share count by 10% over the past two years. with a net leverage of 3x and an interest coverage ratio of 6x, the debt looks manageable for now. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fact of the matter is that Match group is the leader in the dating industry with <a href=\"https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tinder-statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">more than 50%</a> market share. Despite Tinder showing slowing growth and even negative growth this year, it is still the most popular dating app with around 25% market share. In fact Tinder, Hinge and Plenty of Fish are all owned by Match Group and <a href=\"https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tinder-statistics/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">together </a>have around 50% market share. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382672119322_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"910\" data-height=\"664\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382672119322_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Dating apps market share\" width=\"640\" height=\"467\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382672119322_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382672119322_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382672119322_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382672119322_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Business of Apps</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its profitability metrics tell a similar story with a gross margin of 72%, EBIT margin of 25%, net margin of 17.6% and a ROIC of 19%. These high margins and profitability metrics allows Match Group to be more resilient to top-line pressure. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Through my research, it became a recurring theme that Tinder is still the <a href=\"https://www.datingadvice.com/online-dating/most-downloaded-dating-apps-in-the-world\" rel=\"nofollow\">top</a> app and that declining payers and revenue are the only metrics that show Tinder is declining. Don’t get me wrong, payers and revenue from Tinder are the most important metrics to consider but what I am getting at is that the market is overestimating Tinder’s decline and its impact on Match group.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Something to be concerned about is the high CEO turnover since 2019. With four CEOs in eight years, none of them have been able to stop Tinder’s slowing growth and monetization. This is a high risk, as no CEO will be able to implement their vision in just two years. The main problem is that its shareholders have been very impatient with Tinder bleeding users. The new CEO, Spencer Rascoff has made significant changes to Match Group such as reducing its workforce by 13%, reducing management by 20%, centralizing tech and data among all its apps and generating $100 million in annual cost savings. All positive information, but Tinder payers and revenue continues to decline. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before I explain why I think the market may be overestimating the bleeding, I want to quickly comment on Tinder as a service and its problems. As part of this research, I interviewed many students at the University of Arizona. I will later explain other insights I got but a recurring theme is that Tinder is <a href=\"https://medium.com/@victoria-brooks/tinder-is-a-dumpster-fire-now-infested-with-ai-scammers-89c0ebd0787d\" rel=\"nofollow\">plagued with bots and fake accounts</a>. This, combined with the fact that Tinder has a <a href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps\" rel=\"nofollow\">reputation </a>of being an app for hookups, creates a horrible app experience.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Opportunities</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even after being around for so many years, Tinder has still managed to appeal to the young generation with 35% of users being 18-24. It has the highest user penetration within the 18-24 and 25-34 age bracket. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62626171-17721181571774948_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1538\" data-height=\"958\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62626171-17721181571774948_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Tinder age penetration\" width=\"640\" height=\"399\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"399\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62626171-17721181571774948_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62626171-17721181571774948_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62626171-17721181571774948_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62626171-17721181571774948_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Business of Apps</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I interviewed students, Tinder was the most popular dating app with Bumble being a close second. What surprised me the most was that among students who have never used a dating app, the first app they would consider was Tinder. I think there is a massive opportunity in the fact that the <a href=\"https://ssrs.com/insights/the-public-and-online-dating-in-2024/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">young generation</a> still use it even though it was launched when they were between 4-10 years old.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-1771638267620307_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1350\" data-height=\"781\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-1771638267620307_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Age market share\" width=\"640\" height=\"370\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-1771638267620307_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-1771638267620307_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-1771638267620307_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-1771638267620307_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SSRS</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this increasingly globalized world, it looks like Tinder is the first option for most countries when online dating and the hookup culture get adopted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382675882742_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"715\" data-height=\"479\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382675882742_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Top 3 dating apps among asian countries\" width=\"640\" height=\"429\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382675882742_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382675882742_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382675882742_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382675882742_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GMCR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another opportunity I see is that Bumble is actually in a worse situation than Tinder. Bumble’s paying users decreased 16% in Q3 2025 compared to an 8% decline for Tinder. Dating apps don't release user data only payer data but from the fact that Bumble has the same market share in the US at around 25%, and Tinder has double the amount of paying users at 8.8 million which means that Tinder is better at converting users into paying users. With this race to the bottom, although negative for Match Group's largest app, in general Hinge will benefit. I think this is the advantage that Match Group has, with such a diverse portfolio of apps, it is certain that Match Group will benefit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the biggest opportunity however is again what the market is pricing Tinder will be in the future which I projected.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My objective with this valuation was to determine what growth rates the market is pricing for Tinder and Hinge. To do this, I first of all assumed a WACC of 7%, which is an average of what I calculated and what I saw on different websites. I then broke down each of Match Groups segments and projected its RPP, Payer and operating income to project the revenue and operating income of each of the segments. I then made a DCF and incorporated the assumed projected revenue and operating income to arrive at a price. With conservative assumptions for the rest of the segments, I then calculated what Tinder's revenue growth will have to be to arrive at the current price of $30. Here are the results:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716390463230448_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1406\" data-height=\"521\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716390463230448_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Top Part of Segment breakdown\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"237\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716390463230448_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716390463230448_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716390463230448_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716390463230448_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716390492439406_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1395\" data-height=\"725\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716390492439406_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Segment Breakdown\" width=\"640\" height=\"333\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716390492439406_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716390492439406_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716390492439406_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716390492439406_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>MTCH 10K </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DCF: </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382672485914_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"764\" data-height=\"713\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382672485914_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DCF\" width=\"640\" height=\"597\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382672485914_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382672485914_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382672485914_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382672485914_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Observations </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The results show that with, in my opinion, realistic assumptions for the rest of the segments, the market is pricing in a 27% decline in Tinder revenue for the next 5 years. This is the main point of my thesis as it looks like the market has been chronically misunderstanding the slowing and now decreasing revenue from Tinder. Its diversified portfolio with the third largest dating app allows Match Group to be resistant to large declines in Tinder. With high adoption rates among emerging markets and among the youth populations it looks like it's very unlikely for Tinder to decrease so much in the next couple of years. In my view, that looks overly pessimistic. If I assume a more realistic 10% annual decline in Tinder paying users (instead of the market-implied path), my valuation increases to about $52 per share, implying ~73% upside. Now in the risk section I will try to point out the risk that the market may be also pricing in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the main problem with a business model like Tinder is that barely anyone pays for these apps. Out of the 50 students I interviewed, only two had paid for a dating app, Tinder, and only for a brief period of time. Both of them told me it worked too well and didn’t even have the time to respond to every match. Any dating app has to balance its effectiveness and its monetization as each has the opposite effect. In a couple of interviews, students told me that they met their couple on dating apps and even someone’s sister met her husband on Tinder but I doubt any of them paid for it. Tinder relies on the hook up culture to receive compensation for unlimited swipes, which, in turn, worsens the app for people not looking for that (which is a big portion). With an intense dependency on networking effects, this makes Tinder be in a negative feedback loop where Tinder depends on people looking for a different experience than the majority, causing users to leave.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the tumultuous CEO turnover it is hard for investors to understand the direction Match Group is taking and actually see changes. This combined with the fact that it has negative equity and a negative tangible book value of $2.7 billion makes it more risky. Leverage has only been increasing with $700 million added in 2025 while revenue stayed basically flat. In 2025, it returned to shareholders more than 100% of its FCF and management has committed to continue doing that. With cash growing, this suggests that debt may be helping fund aggressive capital returns (buybacks + dividends). This has me questioning the sustainability of its high share repurchase program and how responsibly management is using debt to support capital returns. With more than half of its total assets being goodwill and with many of its sectors declining in revenue, it is likely that an asset impairment will happen. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The way I see it is that the market is overestimating and overweighing Tinder’s declining revenue in a sector with intense networking effects. Despite the fact that paying for these services is a luxury barely anyone pays for, its international reach and popularity among the young generation is overlooked. The market could be pricing in a 27% decline every year or a 1% terminal decline and still Match Group’s portfolio will resist it. There have always been controversies with dating apps but I still believe that these will still be used and in an increasing amount of countries. Globalization <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362170308_Hook-up_culture_among_young_Indian_adults_in_Indian_metropolitan_cities\" rel=\"nofollow\">has</a> made hookup culture expand to other countries such as India, Indonesia and Japan and this trend will only continue. Tinder is the first app in mind for online dating and intense networking effects will make it hard for this to change. I rate this a Buy,</p>",

Even though these fears feel validated given that there is a swath of SaaS companies trading at massive multiples while providing marginal value to end consumers, the market has certainly overreacted on this one name that possesses a deep moat, high operational efficiency, double-digit top line growth, and enough capital and investments to benefit from this compute revolution, and that name is Microsoft Corporation (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">YTD, Microsoft's stock has declined by more than 20%, while its mega-cap peers only declined by single-digits. This drawdown is underserved for a company that has dominated the software industry for decades, proving management's tenacity and drive to maintain the innovative streak that enabled the firm to survive multiple tech revolutions. This time is no different, and if anything, to me it looks like the AI revolution will likely benefit incumbents rather than startups, given the upfront capital required for training and inference. This overreaction is giving investors that seek quality names an opportunity to benefit from MSFT's upside as the market corrects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among the Mag 7 names, Microsoft was one of the names that underperformed the SPDR® S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>) and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAGS\" title=\"Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF\">MAGS</a>) on a 1-year performance, losing 5% of its value while MAGS and the SPY returned 16.59% and 15.07%, respectively. The outperformance of these ETFs was largely influenced by the massive rally of Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>), which returned 72.33% YoY, outperforming both ETFs and its mega-cap peers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719467901819174.png?io=w640\" alt=\"YoY performance\" width=\"636\" height=\"550\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"636\" data-height=\"550\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719467901819174.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719467901819174.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719467901819174.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">YoY performance <span>(YCharts)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My job as an analyst is not to just look at the firm's financial statements and do fundamental and comparable analysis to tell whether this could be a great investment or not; additionally, one should also do meta-analysis, meaning get a sense of how other market participants could be viewing the stock, because ultimately these are the people who deepen their wallets and hit the bid, resulting in a repricing. I have stated in my previous <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4866501-newmarkets-corporation-stock-i-see-ceiling-to-earnings-growth\">writings</a> that in 2026 we are seeing a sector rotation, where capital is fleeing tech and going to less fashionable sectors like energy and materials. The core reason for this behavior is that most investors are starting to be wary of the promises that most tech names made trying to justify tight and often negative profit margins while trading at high multiples. AI adoption has also magnified the worry. Instead, investors are now lowering the risk exposure by loading capital to high-margin names that look insulated from the AI disruption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The chart below shows the behavior difference between tech and the materials sector. For tech names, we are seeing EBITDA multiples trending down as EBITDA margins increase, highlighted by the slow decline in the green trend line, implying that investors would often pay more for low profitability as long as the multiples were justified by high topline growth. This is not the case in sectors like materials, where profitability actually matters, as it reflects the operational strength of the firm to return capital to its shareholders. This is highlighted by the slight upslope of the red trend line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719468681093853_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1276\" data-height=\"506\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719468681093853_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Technology vs Materials sector\" width=\"640\" height=\"254\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"254\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719468681093853_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719468681093853_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719468681093853_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719468681093853_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Technology vs Materials sector <span>(Analyst Chart, Stock Analysis)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Digging in more into software names, this trend is even clearer. This reflects a historical behavior where investors over-indexed for growth and under-indexed for profitability. The rationale was that once software companies get to operate at a massive scale, it's easy to expand margins due to consumer lock-in. These assumptions are now in question, and it looks like companies with low margins will continue to witness price drops in the coming quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Microsoft is insulated from this risk, in my opinion; it has one of the highest EBITDA margins in the sector but still trades below peers on EBITDA multiples (16.48 vs. the sector median of 17.51). The reason MSFT received a D- rating for valuation is due to its high price-to-sales multiple of 9.35 vs. the sector median of 3.12; this is not a preferred multiple to use for companies of Microsoft's scale. Ultimately, what matters to investors is the company's earnings power and how much of these earnings it returns to its shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-1771946960886828_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1276\" data-height=\"506\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-1771946960886828_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EBITDA Multiple vs Margins\" width=\"640\" height=\"254\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"254\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-1771946960886828_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-1771946960886828_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-1771946960886828_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-1771946960886828_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EBITDA Multiple vs Margins <span>(Analyst Chart, Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not surprisingly to me, most of these low-margin software stocks have actually performed badly YoY.

Operating expenses increased 5% to $17.02 billion, leading to operating income increasing 21% to $38.28 billion and landing EBIT margins at 59.36%, outperforming the sector margin, which is 6.62%. Pretax and net income increased 64% and 60% to $48.25 billion and $38.46 billion, respectively, bolstered by $9.97 billion from non-operating income, which landed EPS at $4.14 and an estimate beat by $0.22. Bear in mind that the firm now records capital gains from its investment, like in OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>), as miscellaneous income inflating pre-tax and net income. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719474649711225_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6000\" data-height=\"3000\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719474649711225_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q2 2026 Income Statement\" width=\"640\" height=\"320\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"320\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719474649711225_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719474649711225_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719474649711225_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719474649711225_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Q2 2026 Income Statement <span>(Analyst Chart, SEC Fillings)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q2 2026 Cash Flow Statement</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT/cash-flow-statement\">cash flow</a> also increased 60% to $35.76 billion, offset by a $9.63 billion cash outflow from working capital. Capital expenditures increased 89% to $29.88 billion, with 2/3 of the spending going to short-lived assets like GPUs and CPUs; this high expenditure led to FCF decreasing by 22% to $2.66 billion, landing FCF margins at 3.27%, underperforming the sector margin, which is 11.01%. This is the section of Microsoft's financials most investors are concerned about. I don't share the same concerns. Yes, if the firm were to reallocate these spendings to share repurchases and dividend payouts, the stock would easily rerate higher, but this would then put the company in a vulnerable position to get disrupted by firms that are willing to deepen their pockets and grow dominance in the AI space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719475419788127_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6000\" data-height=\"4000\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719475419788127_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q2 2026 Cash Flow Statement\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"427\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719475419788127_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719475419788127_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719475419788127_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719475419788127_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Q2 2026 Cash Flow Statement <span>(Analyst Chart, SEC Fillings)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q2 2026 Balance Sheet</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And besides, it's not like Microsoft is using debt to build GPU chips and data centers; in fact, as illustrated by the state of its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a>, current debt decreased 8% to $4.8 billion, and long-term debt decreased 11% to $35.4 billion, while reserved cash increased 39% to $24.3 billion. The concerning item in Microsoft's assets is investments increasing 21% to $65.2 billion, making the current asset base more sensitive to mark-to-market repricing of these liquid assets the firm holds. If these assets are marked lower than the purchase price, we could see a decline in current assets. The same concern is true with long-term assets, as PP&amp;E accounts for $261.1 billion and grew by 56% YoY. A majority of these assets are GPU and CPU chips with changing depreciation schedules and could be made obsolete by newer and more advanced GPU releases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719490868786602_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6000\" data-height=\"4000\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719490868786602_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q2 2026 Balance Sheet\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"427\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719490868786602_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719490868786602_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719490868786602_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719490868786602_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Q2 2026 Balance Sheet <span>(Analyst Chart, SEC Fillings)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earlier in the article, I did point out charts that showed that Microsoft trades cheaply relative to its sector while returning more than average margins.

Given that depreciation schedules of GPUs and CPUs fluctuate drastically in response to newer releases. There's a small likelihood that these GPUs are losing value quickly, which will shorten the depreciation schedule, compressing margins, which would paint a dim picture of Microsoft fundamentals, impacting the valuation rerating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second risk has to do with the fact that 45% of Microsoft's backlog is sourced from OpenAI. Given the intensifying competition in the AI space coming from Google's Gemini and Anthropic, the chances of OpenAI losing its dominance and failing to deliver on Microsoft's obligations are increasing, and that could reduce Microsoft's future revenue expectation by $280 billion. One analyst pointed this risk out during the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4863620-microsoft-corporation-msft-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">Q2 2026 earnings call</a>, and management's response wasn't convincing to me, as it didn't lay out a coherent plan on how management is planning to reduce this exposure; instead, they just said the risk is lower relative to peers, which is not a good response.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719493506443791.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q2 2026 earnings transcript\" width=\"575\" height=\"412\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"575\" data-height=\"412\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719493506443791.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719493506443791.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719493506443791.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Q2 2026 earnings transcript <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Microsoft has experienced a massive selloff YTD due to the capital exodus that affected the broader tech and software sector; as a result, the firm now trades below its sector and mega peers on earnings multiple while continuing to grow top line by double digits and expanding margins at a consistent rate. This presents an appealing buying opportunity, as I estimate more capital will start flowing to high-margin companies as a risk to safety bet. I rate Microsoft a Buy.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><i>Editor's Note:</i></span><i> This article was submitted as part of Seeking Alpha's </i><i><a target=\"_blank\" url=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855433-new-article-competition-top-2026-long-idea\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855433-new-article-competition-top-2026-long-idea\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Top 2026 Long Idea investment competition</a></i><i>, which runs through February 28.

And looking back, we can state that my “Hold” ratings were probably correct, and so far, Adobe has not been a great investment. When one would have bought the stock at the point the articles were published, one would have lost money.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my last article, however, I wrote in the conclusion:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Although the stock was trading for cheaper prices in the past, this is the first time I would see Adobe as a cautious “Buy” instead of a “Hold” during my last articles.

Since my last article was published, Adobe has declined 40% and now the stock is trading more than 60% below its previous all-time high.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_c67cbb718fe23b6a6db7da61415a9d55.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_c67cbb718fe23b6a6db7da61415a9d55.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_c67cbb718fe23b6a6db7da61415a9d55.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_c67cbb718fe23b6a6db7da61415a9d55.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When looking back at the history of Adobe, we see several years of steep declines for the stock – and the current decline is not even the steepest. <span>T</span>he stock suffered several drawdowns of 50% or more. Nevertheless, the stock seems very cheap at this point. I already rated the stock as a “Buy” in my last article, and now – with the stock trading 40% lower again – we take another look and argue why Adobe seems like a bargain, in my opinion. Software companies are under attack, but Adobe is not only reporting still great metrics - it's also trading for very low valuation multiples. Hence, many risks - including less consistent growth rates over the years - should already be reflected in the stock price, making it difficult to be bearish.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Extremely Low Valuation Multiples</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We start by looking at the extremely low valuation multiples Adobe is trading for right now. Right now, Adobe is trading for 14.7 times earnings, which is already a low valuation multiple. We must go back to the years around 2010 to find similar low valuation multiples for Adobe, and it's clearly trading below the long-term average of 44.62.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_1e1421dc4bcdee774a73b6f35f6bf3c4.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_1e1421dc4bcdee774a73b6f35f6bf3c4.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_1e1421dc4bcdee774a73b6f35f6bf3c4.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_1e1421dc4bcdee774a73b6f35f6bf3c4.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When looking at the price free cash flow ratio, we get even more extreme numbers. At the time of writing, Adobe is trading for 10.8 times free cash flow, clearly below the long-term average of 27.56 and very close to the all-time low of 8.3. This is hinting towards an extreme bargain or a company that is clearly struggling to grow – to answer this question, we can start by looking at the last quarterly results.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Quarterly Results</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On Dec. 10, 2025, Adobe reported fourth quarter and full-year results for its fiscal year 2025. We start by looking at full-year results. Total revenue increased from $21,505 million in fiscal 2024 to $23,769 million in fiscal 2025 – resulting in 10.5% year-over-year growth. Operating income increased 29.1% year-over-year from $6,741 million in fiscal 2024 to $8,706 million in fiscal 2025. And finally, diluted net income per share increased from $12.36 in fiscal 2024 to $16.70 in fiscal 2025 – resulting in 35.1% year-over-year growth.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945716541336_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1384\" data-height=\"801\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945716541336_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Adobe is reporting full-year results for fiscal 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"370\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945716541336_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945716541336_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945716541336_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945716541336_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Adobe Q4/25 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Full-year results look pretty solid and don’t really match a P/FCF ratio close to 10. But full-year results might be misleading, and we also have to look at the last quarterly results to see whether growth rates are slowing down. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, total revenue increased from $5,606 million in Q4/24 to $6,194 million in Q4/25 – resulting in 10.5% year-over-year growth. Operating income increased 15.5% year-over-year from $1,957 million in the same quarter last year to $2,261 million in this quarter. And diluted net income per share increased from $3.79 in Q4/24 to $4.45 in Q4/25 – resulting in 17.4% year-over-year growth for the bottom line.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457175488305_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1384\" data-height=\"831\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457175488305_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Adobe's performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457175488305_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457175488305_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457175488305_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457175488305_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Adobe Q4/25 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the next step, we can look at the guidance for fiscal 2026.

Of course, return on invested capital is fluctuating more than the company’s margins. Nevertheless, Adobe is reporting high return on invested capital on average – 24.6% in the last 10 years and 28.41% in the last five years. Additionally, we see RoIC accelerating in the recent past, which is also a good sign for the business.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457195196776_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"912\" data-height=\"508\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457195196776_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Adobe: Profitabililty and Efficiency\" width=\"640\" height=\"356\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457195196776_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457195196776_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457195196776_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457195196776_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Adobe: Profitabililty and Efficiency <span>(Author's work)</span></p></figcaption></figure> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Software Under Attack</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A new technology is usually generating winners and losers and leading to major shifts in the economy. Right now, it seems to be the consensus that the business model of many software companies is under immense pressure or that some businesses might even go bankrupt – otherwise many valuation multiples can’t be explained.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And at first, we have to assume that GenAI applications can perform many of the tasks Adobe’s products are used for, quite well. However, that statement might be too superficial, and we will try to break it down by looking at the three reporting segments of Adobe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The offerings bundled in the Publishing and Advertising segment might actually be at high risk. However, Adobe is generating only about $260 million in annual revenue from this segment, and it has already been declining in the past few years. Tasks like web application development or technical document publishing seem almost like perfect tasks for AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second segment is Digital Experiences, which is responsible for $5.86 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025 and is growing about 9% year-over-year. For the applications offered in this business segment, there's also the risk of GenAI taking market share. Tasks like measuring customer experiences and providing analytics and reporting for advertisers, agencies, or publishers can certainly be replaced by other GenAI applications. However, these systems are usually deeply embedded in the company’s structure, and aspects like multi-channel coordination (due to different stakeholders) are hard to replace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the company’s third segment, <em>Digital Media</em>, the situation is similar. In fiscal 2025, it was generating $17.65 billion in revenue – resulting in a growth rate of 11.3% year-over-year. This segment offers applications to create, publish, and promote content, and it seems like GenAI is excelling at these tasks. However, when considering aspects like brand consistency (which is important for huge corporations), professional storytelling, or the fact that usually several different stakeholders are involved, it becomes questionable whether Adobe’s products can actually be replaced by other GenAI applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my last article, I already wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Adobe can generate huge opportunities to hold and grow customers if it is able to offer AI applications that are integrated within other programs in a way that is advantageous to users, which they can’t get anywhere else. If Adobe can include AI features, the switching costs might be high enough that customers will stay with Adobe – especially if other alternatives are similarly expensive.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key for Adobe to defend itself against competitors is focusing on its core applications, which are hard to duplicate at this point and often deeply embedded in a company. The second and decisive step is to include GenAI functionality in its existing products. When Adobe is able to include these features, for which customers might switch to other products, into its products, it most likely can prevent the switching entirely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, we should not ignore the steep learning curve most Adobe applications have. It could take hundreds of hours (or maybe even years) before somebody is at an expert level, and it remains questionable whether companies are willing to give up this knowledge to save a few bucks. The alternative (some GenAI application) has to offer similar functionality for a lower price to get companies to switch, and even if these applications are often more intuitive, it seems unlikely that customers would be willing to sacrifice the experience employees have in established software.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, we also have to consider the possibility that we're all too optimistic at this point about AI and what it can do. One study called<a href=\"https://www.remotelabor.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.remotelabor.ai/\" target=\"_blank\"> <em>Remote Labor Index: Measuring AI Automation of Remote Work</em></a> is painting a rather anticlimactic picture of GenAI and its abilities. Not only are all AI agents clearly below the human baseline when using an Elo score, but they're also able to achieve only a very small percentage of the tasks given.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945711449302_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1734\" data-height=\"1266\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945711449302_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Automation Rate and Elo score of different LLMs\" width=\"640\" height=\"467\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945711449302_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945711449302_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945711449302_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945711449302_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Remote Labor Index Paper</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, replacing humans and replacing other software applications are two different things. Nevertheless, the study is showing that we might be too optimistic about GenAI right now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks: Limited Upside, Less Consistency, and Improving AI Models</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest problem I see for Adobe (and some other software companies) is the limited upside and a declining consistency in its results. In the last decade (with most software companies switching to SaaS models), we saw high stability and consistency – especially for revenue growth. This was also part of the reason why software companies were trading for high valuation multiples, as investors usually reward predictability.<a href=\"https://www.idc.com/resource-center/blog/is-saas-dead-rethinking-the-future-of-software-in-the-age-of-ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.idc.com/resource-center/blog/is-saas-dead-rethinking-the-future-of-software-in-the-age-of-ai/\" target=\"_blank\"> It seems likely</a> that a per-user, per-month licensing model will become rather obsolete in the years to come, and new metrics like consumption, outcomes, or organizational capability will determine the revenue of software companies (for example, pricing per token). </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In such a scenario, revenue growth is still possible and also at similar rates, but we should expect the picture to be choppier – like it was before companies were switching to subscription models. And we should not expect growth rates to accelerate in any way, as software companies are rather in a defensive mode right now. However, limited upside potential for a company is not equivalent to declining revenue or even growth rates slowing down. Analysts are also remaining quite optimistic that Adobe will be able to grow in the high single digits or maybe even double digits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A final risk for Adobe (and my bullish thesis) in the years to come is an accelerating improvement of AI models. When looking at the <a href=\"https://epoch.ai/benchmarks\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://epoch.ai/benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\">Epoch Capabilities Index</a> for the different models, we still see them making progress and getting better, and the Frontier performance across different benchmarks is also showing improvements.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47657197-17721764141898081_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"908\" data-height=\"510\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47657197-17721764141898081_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Frontiert Performance Across Benchmarks\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47657197-17721764141898081_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47657197-17721764141898081_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47657197-17721764141898081_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47657197-17721764141898081_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>EpochAI</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recently, in an interview, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSg5LInLdhM\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSg5LInLdhM\" target=\"_blank\">Judea Pearl was also pointing out</a> that the current transformer models we have used since 2017 and are still using (and which are responsible for the breakthroughs in the last nine years) can’t be scaled forever.

In the past few years, Adobe was mostly trading for high valuation multiples, making share buybacks rather ineffective. But with the stock trading for almost 10 times free cash flow, it can – and should use – its free cash flow on share buybacks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fiscal 2025, Adobe spent $11,756 million on share buybacks – more than the generated free cash flow and reduced the number of diluted shares outstanding from 443 million in Q4/24 to 417 million in Q4/25 – a decline of 5.9% year-over-year.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_9676803866412a40946cd35e06586176.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_9676803866412a40946cd35e06586176.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_9676803866412a40946cd35e06586176.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_9676803866412a40946cd35e06586176.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When using the free cash flow of the last four quarters ($9.7 billion), Adobe would be able to repurchase slightly above 9% of its shares outstanding, and this by itself would be enough to achieve analysts’ estimated growth rates for the years to come. Of course, this always depends on the stock price remaining at a low level, which seems unlikely if Adobe can continue to grow in the high single digits (or maybe even double digits).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Intrinsic Value Calculation</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the end, let’s calculate an intrinsic value for the stock to determine whether it is a good investment or not. As always, we're calculating with a discount rate of 10%, as this is the annual return we like to achieve at a minimum. Additionally, we calculate with 417 million diluted shares outstanding.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_cee0b5bb307fea4c374f9beb95fe78df.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_cee0b5bb307fea4c374f9beb95fe78df.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_cee0b5bb307fea4c374f9beb95fe78df.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_cee0b5bb307fea4c374f9beb95fe78df.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now we could calculate with the free cash flow of the last four quarters, which was $9,718 million. However, when looking at the free cash flow margin, 40.9% in the last four quarters seems to be rather high and might be a bit too optimistic. Instead, we can calculate with the average free cash flow margin since the IPO, which was 31.9%. When taking the revenue for fiscal 2025, we get a free cash flow of $7,582 million that we're taking as a basis. Now let’s also be very cautious about the growth rates we use and assume only 5% growth for Adobe in the years to come. This leads to an intrinsic value of $363.65 for the stock, and Adobe is already trading below its intrinsic value at this point.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457135284173_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"832\" data-height=\"724\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457135284173_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Adobe: Intrinsic Value Calculation\" width=\"640\" height=\"557\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457135284173_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457135284173_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457135284173_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457135284173_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's work</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, we can calculate even with a more optimistic scenario. For free cash flow, we once again use the average free cash flow margin, but use the expected revenue for fiscal 2026. This leads to an expected free cash flow of $8,294 million, which we take as the basis for our calculation. Additionally, we can be a little more optimistic about growth rates in the years to come and calculate with 6% growth. Using these assumptions, we get an intrinsic value of $497.24, and Adobe would be deeply undervalued at this point. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945714884833_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"832\" data-height=\"732\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945714884833_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Adobe: Intrinsic Value Calculation\" width=\"640\" height=\"563\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945714884833_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945714884833_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945714884833_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945714884833_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's work</span></p></figcaption></figure> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Insider Activity</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One final problem remains and that's something we should not ignore –<a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/adbe/insider-activity\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/adbe/insider-activity\" target=\"_blank\"> insider activity</a>. When assuming that Adobe is clearly a bargain at this point, it's a bit difficult to explain why insiders are only selling and nobody among management is buying the stock so far. If Adobe is really a bargain at this point and would also be perceived by management as a bargain, we should see some buying activity at this point. Of course, managers are not always great investors, and management might have many different reasons for not buying, but it's a piece of information we should also not ignore.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Adobe, similar to many other software companies, is certainly challenged by GenAI and insiders selling are another warning sign. However, aside from those two arguments, it's difficult to argue why Adobe should not be a “Buy” at this point. Looking at the metrics, the company is able to defend itself with high RoIC, increasing margins, and revenue still growing at a solid pace. Additionally, it remains questionable whether new AI applications are actually able to replace Adobe’s offerings for a cheaper price, and the company can defend itself by including GenAI applications in its software offerings.</p>",

Santander is no exception and its P/BV multiple has increased significantly, from a bottom valuation of around 0.3-0.4x book value back in 2020 and just around 0.7x book value one year ago, to its current <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAN/valuation/metrics\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAN/valuation/metrics\" target=\"_blank\">level of 1.63x book value</a>.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Despite this strong re-rating of its shares over the last year, this was not supported by earnings growth, as Santander was pressured by lower rates in Europe over the past few quarters. Nevertheless, the impact was softer than feared some months ago, and earnings momentum has been positive in recent quarters supporting to some extent some re-rating of its shares.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Indeed, Santander has released at the beginning of February its <a href=\"https://www.santander.com/content/dam/santander-com/en/documentos/informacion-privilegiada/2026/02/hr-2026-02-03-2025-results-earnings-presentation-en.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.santander.com/content/dam/santander-com/en/documentos/informacion-privilegiada/2026/02/hr-2026-02-03-2025-results-earnings-presentation-en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2025 earnings</a>, with both revenue and earnings being above market expectations. Its revenues amounted to €62.4 billion in 2025, being flat compared to the previous year, as net interest income (NII) was pressured by lower rates in Europe and currency effect also had a negative impact on revenues, while fees were stronger and were able to offset weakness in NII.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Santander is one of the European banks more geared to interest rates, both due to its high reliance of NII on overall revenues (NII accounted for 73% of revenues in 2025), but also due to its higher exposure than average to variable-rate loans. This profile is obviously negative during a period of declining rates, making Santander’s NII weakness not a surprise and explains why NII declined by 3% YoY during 2025.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>By business segment, this impacted mainly its retail banking segment, which is more exposed to loans, while other segments had a better performance and reported increasing revenues during last year. Specifically, payments were a bright area with revenues increasing to €6 billion, representing an increase of 17% YoY, driven by higher customer transaction activity, both related to credit cards and digital payments. The wealth segment also had a positive performance, a trend that was also visible for other peers, as rising capital markets and net inflows from customers boosted activity and fees during 2025.</span></p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226352423818_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"997\" data-height=\"448\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226352423818_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart of payments and wealth segments\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"288\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226352423818_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226352423818_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226352423818_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226352423818_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">KPIs <span>(Santander)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Given this background, it’s not surprising to see that Santander’s fees increased by 5% YoY, to €13.6 billion in 2025, reaching a recover level.

This shows that credit quality has not changed much over the past few quarters, being positive earnings stability.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Considering that Santander’s revenues, costs, and provisions for loan losses were almost unchanged during the last year, it’s somewhat surprising to see that its bottom-line increased by 12% YoY to €14.1 billion. This was largely driven by ‘other results’ that amounted to <a href=\"https://www.santander.com/content/dam/santander-com/en/documentos/informe-financiero-anual/2025/ifa-2025-consolidated-annual-financial-report-en.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.santander.com/content/dam/santander-com/en/documentos/informe-financiero-anual/2025/ifa-2025-consolidated-annual-financial-report-en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">negative €3.4 billion in 2025</a>, representing a decline of 30% YoY. These are related to impairment of assets, revaluations of financial assets, and other financial results that aren’t specifically related to the operating performance of the bank. This means Santander’s operating result was practically unchanged during 2025, with most of its earnings growth coming from less negative non-structural ‘other results’, that may not be recurring in future years.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>This shows that Santander’s underlying growth prospects aren’t particularly impressive, a profile that the street seems to agree with, considering that both revenue and earnings <a href=\"https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANCO-SANTANDER-S-A-69308/finances/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANCO-SANTANDER-S-A-69308/finances/\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a> are expected to increase around low single-digits growth rates in 2026.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>However, despite this relatively weak organic growth profile, Santander’s financial figures are expected to be impacted by several M&amp;A operations that are pending, including the sale of its Polish unit and the acquisition of TSB Bank in England. Moreover, Santander has recently<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4546481-banco-santander-to-acquire-webster-financial-in-123b-cash-and-stock-deal\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4546481-banco-santander-to-acquire-webster-financial-in-123b-cash-and-stock-deal\" target=\"_blank\"> announced</a> the acquisition of Webster Financial (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBS\" title=\"Webster Financial Corporation\">WBS</a>) for some $12.3 billion in a cash-and-stock deal in the U.S., being the largest acquisition from a European bank in the country over the last two decades.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>As Santander was expected to have some excess capital when it completes the sale of the Polish unit, with only part of proceeds being recycled on TSB Bank, it has capacity to grow in other regions and has decided to expand its presence in the U.S.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>This acquisition was valued at about 2x tangible book value, which is not particularly cheap, as Santander seems to be buying at the top of the cycle. However, as Santander U.S. is a segment that is largely exposed to consumer finance, namely auto finance, this acquisition allows it to change its profile in the U.S. and become much more exposure to retail and commercial banking. Indeed, within the group, the U.S. operation had a different profile compared to other regions that are usually more exposed to retail and commercial banking, something that was somewhat odd as Santander has a conservative risk profile and auto finance is not particularly a core business in other regions.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Therefore, I see this acquisition as a positive step on a strategic point of view for its U.S. operation, leading to a lower risk profile and a more sustainable operation over the long term. This is also visible on some key financial indicators, such as the cost of risk that is expected to be reduced by some 30 bps for the combined bank and the loans-to-deposits that should decline from 109% to 100% following the consolidation of Webster.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Moreover, Santander expects to extract about €800 million of annual cost synergies from this acquisition, leading to improved profitability of the combined bank over the next few years and EPS accretion of 7-8% by 2028.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>With this acquisition Santander will have a much more balanced loan book profile in the U.S., being in my opinion one of the most attractive factors for this acquisition. As shown in the next graph, the combined entity will have less loan exposure to consumer finance and a higher to weight to commercial &amp; industrial (C&amp;I) loans, as Webster is largely exposed to C&amp;I and commercial real estate (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRE\" title=\"Cre8 Enterprise Limited\">CRE</a>) loans and has a much lower cost of risk ratio than Santander’s current U.S. operations.</span></p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226361793773.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart of combined loan book in the US\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"618\" height=\"512\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226361793773.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226361793773.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226361793773.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Loan book <span>(Santander)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Beyond announcing earnings and the acquisition of Webster, Santander has also performed an investor day recently, presenting new financial target and business outlook for the next three years. Its strategy is not expected to change much in the near future, aiming to grow its business through customer growth while cutting costs and improving efficiency at the same time, namely by using technology and AI.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Regarding its financial targets, Santander <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556634-santander-stock-up-after-bank-declares-targeting-over-20b-in-profit-by-2028\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556634-santander-stock-up-after-bank-declares-targeting-over-20b-in-profit-by-2028\" target=\"_blank\">aims to reach a net profit</a> above €20 billion by 2028 and a return on tangible equity (RoTE) ratio above 20% (vs. 16.3% in 2025), being somewhat aggressive targets in my opinion. Management seems confident that it can achieve business growth over the next three years and continue to improve efficiency to a level around 36% by 2028, being key for higher profitability ahead. As AI is rapidly improving and is making several tasks easily automated, I believe the bank can cut costs significantly over the coming years. Additionally, the consolidation of TSB and Webster should generate important revenue and cost synergies. This means Santander may be able to achieve its financial targets by 2028, but execution is key during this period and is something that investors should monitor closely over the next few quarters and years.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Regarding capital, Santander maintained its target of having a CET1 ratio of at least 13%, which seems acceptable considering the bank’s business profile largely geared to retail and commercial banking. As the bank’s capital ratio is close to its target, the bank has plenty of room to return capital to shareholders ahead, but Santander didn’t change its distribution policy much for the coming years. It expects to return around 50% of annual earnings to shareholders, with about 35% being through dividends and 15% through share buybacks. This seems to be conservative, and Santander could have been more aggressive in my opinion, as there is not much need to retain capital over the next few years.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Banco Santander’s operating performance during 2025 was not fantastic, with revenues and operating profits practically unchanged from the previous year, while the bottom line benefited from lower losses on less relevant financial figures. Despite that, its valuation measured by the P/BV multiple more than doubled during the last year to the highest level over the last decade, as investors have pushed bank stocks to all-time highs in recent months. While Santander is taking good steps to improve its business profile, such as the acquisition of Webster, and its financial targets for 2028 show confidence on business growth and profitability ahead, I think Santander’s current premium valuation is high and makes its risk-reward proposition not much attractive for long-term investors.</span></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
