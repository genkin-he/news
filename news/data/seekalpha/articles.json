It depends on semiconductors, energy, and critical materials. Explore the ETFs providing exposure to the AI buildout.</em></p> <h2>What Actually Powers AI?</h2> <p>It’s easy to think of AI as<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a purely digital phenomenon built on code and data floating in the cloud. But every model runs on physical hardware, consumes real electricity, and depends on materials that are pulled from the ground.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Training a frontier model like GPT-4 reportedly consumed around 50 gigawatt-hours of energy, which is enough to power San Francisco for three days.<sup>1</sup> And that’s just the training phase. Inference, which is the process of actually serving AI to hundreds of millions of users, demands even more sustained power over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All of that computation flows through three critical layers:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Semiconductors</strong> that do the math.</li> <li> <strong>Energy</strong> that keeps the data centers running around the clock.</li> <li> <strong>Strategic metals</strong> embedded in the hardware itself.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When any of those layers hits a bottleneck like a chip shortage, a power constraint, or an export ban on critical minerals, it affects every corner of the AI economy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How Can You Invest in the AI Supply Chain?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rather than chasing the handful of software names that dominate AI headlines, investors can target the physical infrastructure that every one of those companies depends on. VanEck offers three ETFs, each mapped to a distinct layer of the AI supply chain.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td>ETF</td> <td>Role in AI Supply Chain</td> <td>Why It Matters for AI</td> <td>Why Invest</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/semiconductor-etf-smh\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"SMH - VanEck Semiconductor ETF - Overview\"><strong>SMH</strong></a></td> <td>The advanced chips: GPUs, AI accelerators, that perform the trillions of calculations behind model training and inference.</td> <td>Hyperscalers are spending hundreds of billions on AI compute.

Before a model can answer a question or generate an image, semiconductors have to process the data, power plants have to keep the servers running, and raw materials have to be mined, refined, and built into hardware. Each layer depends on the one below it. Here’s how the three layers connect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/51b98c14423a4584bfa714e902338059/6872_ai-stack-blog_infographic_2026-02_v3_web.svg\" alt=\"How the AI Supply Chain Works\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: VanEck.

GPUs and custom accelerators handle the trillions of matrix multiplications required to train large language models, generate images, and run autonomous systems. <strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4608986-semiconductors-and-ai-are-taking-over\" rel=\"noopener noopener\" title=\"If You’re Reading This Semiconductors &amp; AI Are Taking Over\">The entire AI wave is, at its core, a semiconductor demand story</a></strong>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The semiconductor industry also has a structural <strong><a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/videos/what-is-an-economic-moat/\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"What Is an Economic Moat?\">moat</a></strong> and only a handful of companies worldwide can manufacture the most advanced chips.

It’s a single way to access the core of the AI buildout.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why AI Needs Reliable Energy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The challenge is that most of the U.S. energy grid was built decades ago. Solar and wind help, but they’re intermittent - and a data center can’t afford to go dark when the wind stops blowing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s why nuclear is getting serious attention. Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), and Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) have all announced plans to <strong><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4839104-ai-impact-surge-nuclear-investments-everything-need-know\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener\" title=\"AI's Impact on the Surge of Nuclear Investments: Everything You Need to Know\">secure nuclear power for their AI infrastructure</a></strong>. The federal government has moved to ease nuclear plant regulations and fund next-generation reactor designs.

The fund tracks the MVIS<sup>®</sup> Global Uranium &amp; Nuclear Energy Index. For investors looking to position for the nuclear renaissance that AI is accelerating, NLR offers a direct way in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Materials Are Important to AI?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4870373-copper-and-the-materials-behind-global-electrification\" rel=\"noopener noopener\" title=\"Copper and the Materials Behind Global Electrification\"><strong>Every AI chip, server rack, and cooling system is built from a cocktail of specialized metals.</strong></a> Here are a few raw materials that matter most:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Neodymium and dysprosium</strong> power the high-strength permanent magnets inside hard drives, server fans, and cooling pumps.</li> <li> <strong>Copper</strong> carries massive electrical currents through the busbars and wiring that connect clustered AI systems.</li> <li> <strong>Tantalum</strong> goes into the capacitors that regulate voltage in GPUs and memory modules during rapid workload shifts.</li> <li> <strong>Gallium and germanium</strong> are essential for advanced chip fabrication and the high-speed fiber optics inside data centers.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The geopolitical dimension here is hard to ignore. China produces the majority of the world’s rare earths and controls nearly all of the processing capacity. The Chinese government recently imposed export licensing rules that require foreign buyers to disclose end-use applications - effectively restricting access for U.S. defense and advanced technology purchasers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Western governments are investing in domestic mining and processing alternatives, but reshoring these supply chains is a multi-year project.

Almost a year ago, in February of 2025, I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4759870-kontoor-brands-helly-hansen-massive-purchase\">evaluated</a> the company's purchase of Helly Hansen. This was<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a massive acquisition, costing shareholders $900 million. However, it opened up the door to the company diversifying into the outdoor and workwear market. As interesting as the transaction was, I remained worried about the valuation of the business and high-interest expenses that would negatively affect cash flows. That resulted in me calling it a ‘hold’ as opposed to a ‘buy.’ Sure enough, my concerns have materialized. Even though recent revenue is up, profitability and cash flows have declined. The company is showing weakness when it comes to profit margins involving its Lee brand, and Helly Hansen really isn't bearing any fruit from a profitability standpoint.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This helps to explain why shares have fallen, dropping 33.1% since my article. Over that same window of time, the S&amp;P 500 is up 12.9%. This return disparity is certainly discouraging, and some investors may view it as an opportunity to jump in on the cheap. But even if we factor in projected synergies associated with Helly Hansen, I don't see any reason to be terribly optimistic at this time. If the stock were any more expensive than it is now, I would probably be a bit bearish. But as things stand, I think that it deserves a ‘hold’ rating still.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I do think it is necessary, if you are going to be an investor, to be flexible in your thinking. As new data comes in, I like to incorporate it into my thinking in order to decide whether or not a previous thought process or decision made sense. The good news for investors is that we will soon have some new data to go off of. Before the market opens on March 3rd, management will be announcing financial results for the final quarter of the company's 2025 fiscal year. As we approach that date, the expectation that analysts have is for a surge in revenue and profits. But unfortunately, that will be problematic because of acquisition activity that will ultimately have distorted financial performance. Regardless, investors should keep a close eye on this data because it could prove instrumental in deciding whether an upgrade or even a downgrade is appropriate.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trying on Kontoor Brands</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900209947306_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2168\" data-height=\"850\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900209947306_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"251\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"251\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900209947306_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900209947306_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900209947306_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900209947306_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because of the company's purchase of Helly Hansen in May of last year, financial performance for windows of time prior to that really isn't all that relevant.

Revenue has managed to increase nicely, climbing from $1.91 billion in 2024 to $2.13 billion at the same time in 2025. This requires some unpacking, though. Obviously, the purchase of Helly Hansen played a large role here. That company went from generating nothing in the way of revenue for Kontoor Brands in 2024 to generating $212.6 million worth in the first nine months of last year. That is a huge lift. But it is worth noting that this is not the only source of revenue growth that the company enjoyed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003202338529_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2294\" data-height=\"866\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003202338529_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"242\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"242\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003202338529_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003202338529_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003202338529_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003202338529_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also on the rise ended up being its Wrangler segment, with revenue jumping from $1.30 billion to $1.35 billion. Management attributed this growth to broad-based expansion, with sales in the Americas growing 4% year over year and sales in the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) regions expanding by 6%. In the Americas, the company benefited from greater wholesale revenue attributable to category growth and a rise in its US licensing and digital wholesale operations. However, the company also enjoyed some expansion when it came to its direct-to-consumer business as e-commerce sales grew. Some of the benefit associated with the EMEA region can be chalked up to a 3% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The rest, meanwhile, involved greater direct-to-consumer demand and wholesale revenue growth that was driven by its digital wholesale business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4836943-kontoor-brands-inc-ktb-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">third quarter earnings call</a>, the management team at Kontoor Brands expressed that its Wrangler brand enjoyed its 14th consecutive quarter of market share growth. This included greater demand in its core men's and women's bottoms business. The company also enjoyed a 20% growth rate associated with its female business during the quarter. Collaborative arrangements, such as its partnership with Lainey Wilson, performed very well. And on top of this, its Western category reported high single-digit growth year over year, and the expectation is that additional growth should continue thanks to the brand being represented by some of the top athletes in the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900337367776_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2308\" data-height=\"852\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900337367776_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"236\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"236\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900337367776_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900337367776_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900337367776_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900337367776_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of Lee. Revenue here actually dropped from $597.1 million to $552.3 million. That is a substantial decline, with management blaming it largely on an 8% drop in revenue in the Americas and a 12% drop in the Asia Pacific region. In the Asia Pacific region, management said that this was primarily the result of inventory management actions by retailers. However, it's clear that overall demand for the brand has dropped. The good news is that management has hope that the picture will turn around. In fact, they said that 2026 will be a ‘transition year’ for Lee. In order to deal with this weakness, the company has been making some big changes. This includes consolidating distribution partners. Specifically, the company has been partnering up with larger, more sophisticated partners that are more capable of investing with the company in order to build and drive the brand as time goes on. Certain inventory actions have also been taken, and the company is investing more heavily in its direct-to-consumer presence for this brand. Hopefully, that will start to bear fruit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003474710207_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2278\" data-height=\"870\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003474710207_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"244\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"244\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003474710207_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003474710207_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003474710207_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689003474710207_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even though revenue for the company increased, overall profitability took a hit. Net income dropped from $181.8 million to $153.7 million. There were several contributors to this, one of which was a rise in interest expense from $30.9 million to $42.3 million. However, the company also saw a surge in other costs, with one notable example being its selling, general, and administrative expenses. Those skyrocketed from 31.3% of sales to 34.5%. Some of this increase seems to have been the result of one-time events associated with its purchase of Helly Hansen. However, it's also true that Helly Hansen itself is nowhere near as profitable as the other brands. During the first nine months of 2025, the segment achieved segment profits of just $3.2 million. That translates to an operating margin of 1.5%. By comparison, Wrangler boasts a segment profit margin of 23%. Lee is even better, with the profit margin of 11.2%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689002684200006_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2102\" data-height=\"886\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689002684200006_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trading Multiples\" width=\"640\" height=\"270\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"270\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689002684200006_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689002684200006_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689002684200006_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-17689002684200006_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For 2025 in its entirety, management said that revenue would likely be between $3.09 billion and $3.12 billion. And based on the estimates provided by management, we are probably looking at net profits of about $207.8 million, adjusted operating cash flow of $264.6 million, and EBITDA of $327.9 million. Using these estimates and also using the historical results that the company achieved for the 2024 fiscal year, we can see in the chart above how shares are currently priced. However, it is worth noting that the chart in question also includes valuation metrics based on projected synergies and full-year pro forma figures for Helly Hansen as well. This was based primarily on the expectations in my previous article, adjusted for the fact that management is now more optimistic about synergies. Previously, they expected synergies of around $15 million from Helly Hansen. But now they expect those to come in eventually at $25 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900286443872_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2072\" data-height=\"866\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900286443872_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trading Multiples\" width=\"640\" height=\"267\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"267\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900286443872_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900286443872_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900286443872_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/20/9866571-1768900286443872_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These multiples are not bad. In fact, I would say that they put the company in the fair value range. Relative to other firms, the stock might even be a bit cheap. In the chart above, you can see how the company is valued compared to five other similar enterprises. On both a price-to-earnings basis and on a price-to-operating cash flow basis, only one of the five firms is cheaper than it is. However, on an EV-to-EBITDA basis, three of the companies ended up being cheaper.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is one big risk factor here when it comes to the picture moving forward. And this relates to the impact that tariffs could have on the company. The fact of the matter is that most clothing and apparel companies import their goods from other countries. And Kontoor Brands is no exception to this. Management highlighted in their third-quarter earnings call that they expect the impact from tariffs, before factoring in mitigation strategies, to be $135 million for 2026. Some of the mitigation strategies will certainly include cost cutting and changes in sourcing. But investors should expect prices to increase as well. One change that the company made, which was implemented in the third quarter of 2025, was the closure of its Torreon manufacturing facility in Mexico. It's possible that additional asset consolidation will occur as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I stated at the start of this article, management will be announcing financial results for the final quarter of the company's 2025 fiscal year before the market opens on March 3rd. At present, analysts <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KTB/earnings\">anticipate</a> revenue of $976.2 million. That would mark a big jump over the $699.3 million the company reported a year earlier. Because of acquisition activity, such a move higher in revenue is not unexpected. And it does create some real comparability issues. So what I would urge investors to do is to see the extent to which organic revenue growth might have occurred.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/9866571-17717512499144266_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1224\" data-height=\"358\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/9866571-17717512499144266_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Estimates\" width=\"640\" height=\"187\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"187\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/9866571-17717512499144266_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/9866571-17717512499144266_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/9866571-17717512499144266_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/9866571-17717512499144266_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the table above, you can see profitability metrics for the final quarter of 2024 and an estimate when it comes to not only net profits but also earnings per share. The expectation here is for a significant increase, again almost certainly because of acquisition activity. And with that rise is likely to come stronger cash flows as well. Absent something really unexpected, however, such as strong guidance for the 2026 fiscal year, I am unlikely to turn bullish on the business just yet. But given how the stock is priced at the moment, falling meaningfully short of expectations could certainly trigger a downgrade.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As much as I would love to be bullish about Kontoor Brands, I just can't be right now. The stock is not ridiculously priced and is, in fact, cheap relative to other similar firms. But unfortunately, shares are not cheap enough in light of recent underperformance on the bottom line. I am particularly concerned about tariffs moving forward, even though management said that they do expect to offset most of those through mitigation strategies. Add on top of this that the US consumer is already weak, and I believe that a ‘hold’ rating is truly the most generous rating that I can give the company.</p>",

Most of the debt was carried at 100% of par and unencumbered, until it wasn't. This rattled the credit markets and triggered significant write-offs at large financial institutions like UBS and <strong>Jefferies Financial Group Inc.

However, those fears have spiked again in the back half of February. Events at <strong>Blue Owl Capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OWL\" title=\"Blue Owl Capital Inc.\">OWL</a>)</strong> have ignited a sell-off in that stock and in other more well-known industry names like <strong>Blackstone (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BX\" title=\"Blackstone Inc.\">BX</a>)</strong> and <strong>KKR &amp; Co.

The first is that the sector is heavily <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/09/private-credit-software-firms-fall-ai-fears.html?msockid=364e2c764258606d340e3e8343446199\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>exposed</strong></a> to the software sector, as can be seen in Blue Owl's loan book. And this part of the market has been taken out to the woodshed and beaten like a rented mule in recent months on growing fears that AI could disrupt a good chunk of the industry. The sector's downturn can be seen in the chart of the <strong>iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IGV\" title=\"iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF\">IGV</a>)</strong>. UBS was out last week <a href=\"https://www.fa-mag.com/news/private-credit-fears-deepen-with-ubs-warning-of-15--defaults-86002.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>stating</strong></a> that if AI triggers an “<em>aggressive</em>” disruption among corporate borrowers, private credit default rates could hit 15%. That is up from the 13% top rate UBS articulated earlier in February.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17723018252288325_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"728\" data-height=\"263\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17723018252288325_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IGV Stock Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"231\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17723018252288325_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17723018252288325_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17723018252288325_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17723018252288325_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IGV Stock Chart <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, following Covid, the Federal Reserve brought rates down to zero and boosted the money supply by roughly 40% over two years. This boosted asset prices substantially and also resulted in many businesses getting funded that properly shouldn't. Or at least not at the rates they were able to float debt. Those loans will need to be refinanced at much higher rates in coming quarters and years. This should boost delinquency and default rates significantly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_5d67ea8dc65b94f14666c6d4a2a8bdba.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Private Credit Loan Opportunities\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"903\" height=\"504\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_5d67ea8dc65b94f14666c6d4a2a8bdba.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_5d67ea8dc65b94f14666c6d4a2a8bdba.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_5d67ea8dc65b94f14666c6d4a2a8bdba.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_5d67ea8dc65b94f14666c6d4a2a8bdba.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_5d67ea8dc65b94f14666c6d4a2a8bdba.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Macro Butler, Zero Hedge</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third, following the Great Financial Crisis, regulators made it increasingly challenging for banks to hold riskier assets like leveraged loans and other types of debt. This has spurred the huge growth in private credit, which has filled the void in lending to a lot of these mid-market concerns and towards other debt opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are some downsides to this migration that could be much more apparent in the coming months. Private credit is subject to less regulation and transparency than bank loan books. There is also a duration mismatch that seems to be getting more attention recently. Many commercial loans tend to run five to seven years in duration on average, which can become a problem in a private credit fund with quarterly redemptions. One of the reasons Blue Owl had to put a '<em>gate</em>' on one of its funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_86e52813bcd94b1baeb8b0fd1a3b3f43.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Public versus Private Debt\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"894\" height=\"492\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_86e52813bcd94b1baeb8b0fd1a3b3f43.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_86e52813bcd94b1baeb8b0fd1a3b3f43.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_86e52813bcd94b1baeb8b0fd1a3b3f43.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_86e52813bcd94b1baeb8b0fd1a3b3f43.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_86e52813bcd94b1baeb8b0fd1a3b3f43.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Macro Butler, Zero Hedge</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, prudent investors should monitor the private credit space closely in the coming months. Be on the lookout for increased mentions of terms like '<em>arm's length transaction,'</em> '<em>counterparty risk,</em>' '<em>payment in kind,'</em> '<em>extend &amp; pretend,'</em> and '<em>mark to market,'</em> as these were common terms leading up to and throughout the Great Financial Crisis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One should also peruse their portfolio to ensure all holdings are in names with solid balance sheets. If credit markets start to develop increased stress, these might be the kind of stocks that get sold off indiscriminately. I could easily see the markets go further into '<em>risk off</em>' mode in March. In this scenario, defensive sectors like healthcare and consumer staples should outperform the overall market. This has already been the case here in 2026 as value has outperformed growth by a good margin. This follows three-plus years where the Magnificent Seven accounted for most of the gains in the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My portfolio remains positioned quite conservatively. Just under 70% is now in <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>covered call</strong></a> holdings around the few stocks in the market I have found with reasonable valuations. That is down from 75% a few weeks ago, as I had several covered call positions expire in the money during February's option expiration date. Almost all the rest of my portfolio is within short-term treasuries and cash awaiting lower entry points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17722922672866442_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"739\" data-height=\"235\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17722922672866442_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"VIX Stock Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"204\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17722922672866442_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17722922672866442_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17722922672866442_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/498952-17722922672866442_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will continue to nibble upon new covered call opportunities as they present themselves.

The stock is<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> hardly alone in this softening, though, with the biggest luxury fashion stocks like Hermès (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HESAY\" title=\"Hermès International Société en commandite par actions\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">HESAY</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), LVMH (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LVMUY\" title=\"LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">LVMUY</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), and Richemont (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CFRUY\" title=\"Compagnie Financière Richemont SA\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">CFRUY</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) seeing pullbacks as well (see chart below).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm more concerned about Kering, though, because its past struggles have been exceptional.

Investors responded rather favourably to its recent full-year results. Even though both revenues and profits continued to shrink, the stock was up by 10% on the day of the earnings release.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There's a very good reason for this. The potential for a return to revenue growth after three years of contraction is beginning to show. Below are the signs that point to the same:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Revenue contraction softens:</strong> Kering's comparable revenues dropped by 10% in 2025, but it was still a slightly smaller contraction than the 12% seen in 2024. Q4 2025 in particular showed encouraging signs as revenue fell by just 3% YoY (Q4 2024: -12%).</li> <li> <strong>Gucci softens less:</strong> The latest numbers for Gucci, which is the biggest contributor to revenues, bringing in 41% of the total in 2025, bear a specific mention. While the full year drop for the brand remained big at 19% (2024: -21%), there was significant improvement in the extent of contraction in Q4 2025. Revenues fell by 10% YoY, compared with 24% YoY in Q4 2024.</li> <li> <strong>Some signs of growth:</strong> Segments like Saint Laurent and Other Houses, which includes brands like Balenciaga, McQueen, and Brioni, showed initial encouraging trends in Q4 2025 too. While Saint Laurent's revenues stabilised (Q4 2024: -8%), Other Houses saw a 3% YoY growth (Q4 2024: -4%). These are important segments, since they together brought in 38% of the company's 2025 revenues, coming quite close to Gucci.</li> <li> <strong>Asia Pacific market gives hope:</strong> While the company's biggest market, Western Europe, with a 30% contribution to revenues in 2025, actually performed worse in 2025, with an 11% revenue drop (2024: -9%), there's hope yet from the Asia Pacific market. It brings in a comparable 29% of the revenues, and saw a drop of 16% in 2025 (2024: -24%), with the extent of decline contracting to 6% YoY in Q4 2025 (Q4 2024: -24% YoY).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722737813601804_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2097\" data-height=\"1061\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722737813601804_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Revenue trends by brand\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"324\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722737813601804_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722737813601804_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722737813601804_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722737813601804_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Kering</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738167810743_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2194\" data-height=\"1062\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738167810743_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Revenue by geography\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"310\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738167810743_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738167810743_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738167810743_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738167810743_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Kering</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">...but profits are still wanting</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is glaringly worse off on the profit front, though, with a margin drop for both recurring operating income and recurring EBITDA (see table below). But the worst news is from the net income front, as the company fell into a loss of EUR 29 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, this was only on a reported basis, which Kering points out includes \"non-recurring items mostly related to optimization and restructuring measures\". The recurring attributable net income, which is the company's version of adjusted net income, was better off with an EUR 532 million profit. Even then, the number was less than half that in 2024 and the net margin dropped to 3.6% (2024: 7.1%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722796610470605_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1305\" data-height=\"635\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722796610470605_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Profit indicators\" width=\"640\" height=\"311\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"311\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722796610470605_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722796610470605_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722796610470605_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722796610470605_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Kering</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note that the profit outcomes are weak despite notable cost cutting by Kering. Its costs, which include both cost of sales and operating expenses, shrank by 7.1% over the year. While lower sales could have contributed to this, there was also conscious cost optimisation at play here. As the graphic below shows, the company reduced store numbers along with other measures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-1772281147517514_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"998\" data-height=\"935\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-1772281147517514_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cost optimisation measures\" width=\"640\" height=\"600\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"600\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-1772281147517514_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-1772281147517514_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-1772281147517514_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-1772281147517514_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Kering</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Can 2026 be better?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The question now is, whether Kering can see improvements in 2026. The company certainly believes so. As the slide below shows, it expects both a return to growth and better margins. Margins could be improved if costs continue to shrink, which should be expected going by Kering's top priority to \"set a lean organization\".</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PPRUY/earnings/estimates\">Analysts' estimates on Seeking Alpha </a>also confirm the likelihood of revenue growth returning, although only marginally so, with a forecast of just 1.3% growth. It's worth noting, though, that the lowest revenue estimate actually indicates a marginal decline even in 2026. So that's a risk to look out for.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings are expected to do better, with nothing short of a 73.8% increase forecast. Although, here too, it's worth pointing out that only one analyst's estimate is available right now. In other words, this doesn't make for a consensus view yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738731794674_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2101\" data-height=\"1209\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738731794674_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Priorities and Outlook for 2026\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"368\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738731794674_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738731794674_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738731794674_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/513629-17722738731794674_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Kering</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market multiples</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Optimism about the stock has clearly run ahead of the fundamentals. PPRUY's forward non-GAAP P/E stands at 37.5x right now, which is rather rich. Consider the following:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The stock's five-year average ratio is at 22.9x, indicating that it's overvalued.</li> <li>It's also trading higher than the corresponding multiples for LVMUY and CFRUY at 24x and 27.7x, respectively, which makes it highly priced compared with peers.</li> <li>PPRUY is trading closest to HESAY, which is at 42.8x. But then HESAY routinely trades at a much higher forward ratio that's explained by its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806697-hermes-better-than-expected-revenues-encourage-holding-on\">consistently healthy performance</a> even during slumps.</li> <li>The Swatch Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SWGAY\" title=\"The Swatch Group AG\">SWGAY</a>), which has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4876492-the-swatch-group-4-reasons-to-buy-now-rating-upgrade\">seen struggles</a> similar to Kering in the recent past, is trading at an impossibly low forward P/E of just 2.3x right now.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's next?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At this point, it's hard to see Kering's price rise significantly again in the immediate future. There's certainly room for optimism, but at a time when the luxury market is yet to take off, there's a risk of revenues remaining soft. As it is, only trivial growth is forecast for 2026. It remains to be seen whether the margins can expand again as well, with this background.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the meantime, the market valuations are looking quite stretched, indicating that the stock can correct, especially as it is significantly higher priced compared with peers. For now, I'm retaining a hold on PPRUY.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VYM\" title=\"Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF\">VYM</a></span>) is<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> one such example, with shares of this popular index tracker returning a spritely 8% so far this year.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Don't be fooled by this fund's name. While it gives off the impression that it's a crude play on yield, VYM's construction methodology is much more balanced than that. What it ultimately produces is a portfolio that looks more like a collection of blue-chip dividend payers than risky high yielders. Admittedly, the fund's focus on dividends can leave it disadvantaged during strong bull markets, as its recent history shows. However, long-term investors looking for a less volatile, low-cost basket of core stocks will find a lot to like here.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_187120370622c8971eff086a1ef81a1e.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_187120370622c8971eff086a1ef81a1e.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_187120370622c8971eff086a1ef81a1e.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_187120370622c8971eff086a1ef81a1e.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Heavy On Blue Chip Dividend Stocks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VYM aims to match the performance of the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which is a U.S. subset of the broader FTSE All-World High Dividend Yield Index. The index starts by deleting companies that have not paid an ordinary dividend in the last 12 months. Those not expected to pay dividends in the next 12 months are also excluded. Real estate investment trusts and mortgage REITs are ineligible regardless.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To construct the index, survivors are first ranked, in descending order, by their 12-month forward dividend yield. The highest-yielding stocks are then selected until 50% of the list's total investable market capitalization has been reached. Finally, constituents are weighted by their investable market cap. Reconstitution occurs twice a year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can probably see, this process will sweep in larger dividend-paying companies that may not necessarily have the highest yields. Weighting by market cap then emphasizes these stocks in the index, mitigating the risks that could arise from smaller yield traps. Finally, the index employs buffer rules to reduce turnover, with existing constituents only removed once they fall beyond the 55th percentile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund's largest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VYM/holdings\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VYM/holdings\" target=\"_blank\">holdings</a> illustrate this, with household blue chips like JPMorgan (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM\" title=\"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.\">JPM</a>), Exxon Mobil (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>), Johnson &amp; Johnson (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNJ\" title=\"Johnson &amp; Johnson\">JNJ</a>), Procter &amp; Gamble (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PG\" title=\"The Procter &amp; Gamble Company\">PG</a>), Chevron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX\" title=\"Chevron Corporation\">CVX</a>), Coca-Cola (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO\" title=\"The Coca-Cola Company\">KO</a>), McDonald's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD\" title=\"McDonald's Corporation\">MCD</a>), and PepsiCo (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP\" title=\"PepsiCo, Inc.\">PEP</a>) all making the top 20-30 holdings. Per Vanguard, the median market cap of the portfolio is a hefty $175 billion (that is to say, stocks with market caps above this level account for half of the fund's assets), with the weighted average market cap clocking in at over $300 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The index's methodology and buffer rules throw up some other points worth considering. Firstly, the largest companies tend to stick around in the portfolio. The eight stocks mentioned above, for example, have consistently been among the fund's largest holdings in recent years, rarely falling out of the top 20.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33446475-17721849220280101_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1142\" data-height=\"572\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33446475-17721849220280101_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF % of Portfolio In JPM, JNJ, XOM, PGC, CVX and KO (Jan 31 2020 - Jan 31 2026)\" width=\"640\" height=\"321\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"321\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33446475-17721849220280101_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33446475-17721849220280101_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33446475-17721849220280101_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33446475-17721849220280101_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Data Source: Vanguard</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, mega-cap stocks do find themselves exiting the fund from time to time. An example of this would be Eli Lilly (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY\" title=\"Eli Lilly and Company\">LLY</a>) in 2023, whose dividend yield collapsed on the back of its stunning Mounjaro-driven share price surge.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_0562539c4915b1b6ab842906c1f3c8ed.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_0562539c4915b1b6ab842906c1f3c8ed.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_0562539c4915b1b6ab842906c1f3c8ed.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_0562539c4915b1b6ab842906c1f3c8ed.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Secondly, selecting stocks until half of the total investable market value has been included results in a relatively high number being admitted. The fund currently holds over 550 names, with the top 10 accounting for around 25% by weight. This makes VYM less top-heavy than composite indices like the Russell 1000 or S&amp;P 500, both of which are dominated by big tech firms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thirdly, screening by yield does give the fund a value tilt. Per <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vym\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vym\" target=\"_blank\">Vanguard</a>, the portfolio's current price-to-earnings ratio is just over 21.1x, representing a roughly 25% discount to the Russell 1000.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, employing dividend-based screens means the fund can look very different from broader-based strategies. Unsurprisingly, the fund is underweight technology compared to composite indices. It is overweight staples. Overall, there is only a 34% overlap by weight between VYM and the iShares Russell 1000 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWB\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 ETF\">IWB</a>). While the fund bears closer resemblance to its category benchmark, overlap with the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWD\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF\">IWD</a>) is still only 55%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Less Bumpy Ride</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The above also has implications for the fund's performance. Given its value tilt, this ETF can lag composite funds during bull markets. This has been a feature of its recent history, as returns trailed the Russell 1000 for three straight calendar years between 2023 and 2025.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_6b43f274250839fcb024910f6d05089c.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_6b43f274250839fcb024910f6d05089c.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_6b43f274250839fcb024910f6d05089c.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_6b43f274250839fcb024910f6d05089c.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the flip side, its focus on mature dividend payers typically makes for a less bumpy ride across an entire cycle. The absence of non-dividend payers and the lower-yielding half of its universe hasn't resulted in underperformance against its category average, either. On the contrary, VYM has significantly outperformed the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF since its inception in 2006, with lower volatility and a higher average dividend yield to boot.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_772143271c5253c0c060b90438635875.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_772143271c5253c0c060b90438635875.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_772143271c5253c0c060b90438635875.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_772143271c5253c0c060b90438635875.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see, the fund has underperformed the composite index in that time, although I think some context may be useful here. The latter does, of course, contain growth stocks. These have gotten more expensive in recent years relative to the value universe, which has been a tailwind that VYM has lacked. Suffice to say that this trend can also work in reverse, and this could benefit the fund.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33446475-17721542940674596_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1240\" data-height=\"606\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33446475-17721542940674596_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Relative Forward PE Ratios Russell 1000 Growth / Russel 1000 Value (2012 - 2025)\" width=\"640\" height=\"313\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"313\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33446475-17721542940674596_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33446475-17721542940674596_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33446475-17721542940674596_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33446475-17721542940674596_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Data Source: Siblis Research</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At $154.93, VYM trades for around 21 times its holdings' earnings. Its distribution yield is currently running well below its historical norm. I think you could look at this in two ways. On the one hand, none of this makes the fund cheap on an intrinsic basis. On the other hand, while value stocks have gotten more expensive, they still haven't seen the same degree of valuation uplift as growth stocks. That being the case, I expect VYM to hold up <em>relatively</em> well.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a53c523d947abd23d3af444456bfdbd2.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a53c523d947abd23d3af444456bfdbd2.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a53c523d947abd23d3af444456bfdbd2.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a53c523d947abd23d3af444456bfdbd2.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, fees are a standout feature of this fund. The expense ratio here is just 4 basis points after its <a href=\"https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/vanguard-delivers-landmark-cost-savings.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/vanguard-delivers-landmark-cost-savings.html\" target=\"_blank\">recent reduction</a>, a level that only a handful of ETFs can beat. And with over $70 billion in assets under management, VYM is large enough to ensure that it will be around for years to come.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF is more sophisticated than its name may suggest. By including half of eligible stocks and weighting by market cap, it is more like a blue-chip dividend fund than a high-yield one. While the fund can lag blended strategies in periods of strongly rising markets, it has a solid track record against its category, while an expense ratio of less than 5 basis points is hard to beat. For investors seeking a more conservative way to own stocks, VYM could be the ideal candidate.</p>",

CrowdStrike (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD\" title=\"CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">CRWD</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) and Zscaler (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZS\" title=\"Zscaler, Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">ZS</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) also dropped about 10% on the news. The financials sector fell more than 3% as American Express (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXP\" title=\"American Express Company\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">AXP</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), Goldman Sachs, and Blackstone (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BX\" title=\"Blackstone Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">BX</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) came under pressure on fears that AI could automate large portions of their businesses. A widely circulated Citrini Research piece warning of 10% AI-driven unemployment gave bears a macro narrative.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet the <em>“AI kills everything”</em> narrative ignores what the data actually shows: companies are integrating AI, not dying from it. McKinsey’s 2025 State of AI survey found 88% of firms already use AI in at least one business function, up from 78% a year prior, while by Q1 2026, that figure reached 78% of U.S. corporations scaling AI enterprise-wide, according to Netguru. Salesforce’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRM\" title=\"Salesforce, Inc.\">CRM</a>) Q4 2026 earnings showed over 22,000 Agentforce deals closed in the quarter, with combined AI and Data Cloud ARR surging to $1.8 billion from $1.4 billion just three months earlier, proving enterprise buyers are choosing to buy AI tools from incumbents rather than be replaced by them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Deloitte’s 2026 State of AI in the Enterprise report found that two-thirds of organizations already report productivity and efficiency gains, while a Harvard study showed that consultants using AI completed tasks 25% faster and at 40% higher quality, augmentation, not elimination. Goldman Sachs Research estimates AI-driven productivity could lift global GDP by 7% <em>(roughly $7 trillion)</em> and sees the next phase of the AI trade rotating precisely toward <em>“productivity beneficiaries,”</em> the non-tech companies that harness AI to widen margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, LPL Research notes that BLS data already shows real output rising 5.4% while hours worked grew just 0.5%, and that only 5.7% of U.S. job hours currently involve generative AI, meaning the largest productivity gains are still ahead, not behind us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The crucial point to consider is that the IBM selloff and SaaS panic of this year may ultimately look less like the beginning of a displacement cycle and more like the kind of reflexive fear that preceded every prior wave of technological adoption. We have seen this same cycle, from ATMs <em>(which </em><em>reduced bank teller employment) </em>to cloud computing <em>(which expanded, not destroyed, enterprise software)</em>. Notably, the companies that adapt capture outsized value, and the ones that don’t were already failing for other reasons.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main event came on Wednesday after the close. Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) reported fiscal Q4 revenue of $68.1 billion, beating the $65.9 billion consensus by 3.3%. Notably, it guided Q1 to $78 billion, well above the $72.8 billion estimate. Data center revenue totaled $62.3 billion, up 75% year over year. However, the stock still fell 5% on Thursday as investors flagged a lack of detail on lingering China uncertainty. However, Nvidia currently trades at a deep discount to the broad market index. While the S&amp;P trades near 22x earnings, Nvidia’s forward PE is 17x with a 0.45 price-to-earnings-growth ratio. With EPS expected to grow by 39.2% over the next 5 years, the fundamentals are compelling. By focusing on a possible future event that may or may not occur, they may miss a fundamentally strong company trading at a discount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The big risk worth watching is that tariff policy remains in legal limbo after the SCOTUS ruling. The AI disruption narrative is broadening beyond software into financials and logistics. And the extreme rotation into Energy, Materials, and Industrials <em>(up 21%, 17%, and 12%, respectively)</em> has left positioning dangerously one-sided against Technology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Resilience is not the same as safety.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Which brings us to the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Technical Backdrop</strong><span> – </span><strong>Technology Gets Tripped Up</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The S&amp;P 500 closed Friday at <strong>6,878</strong>, marking a second consecutive down session. From a pure trend perspective, the market remains in a <strong><em>bullish primary uptrend</em></strong>. But it is clearly struggling within the February consolidation range. The index sits below both its 20-DMA (~6,896) and 50-DMA (~6,899), which have crossed. That bearish crossover acts as overhead resistance rather than support. Every rally attempt in February has stalled in the 6,950–7,000 zone, while every pullback has found buyers near the 100-DMA and the lower consolidation range around 6,831.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-193-scaled.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1577\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-193-scaled.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MACD chart\" width=\"1280\" height=\"986\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-193-scaled.png?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-193-scaled.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-193-scaled.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-193-scaled.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-193-scaled.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-193-scaled.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-193-scaled.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Heading into March, seasonal data provides <strong><em>a positive tailwind</em>.</strong> Since 1964, the S&amp;P 500 has posted an average price return of approximately +1.1% during March. That makes it one of the better-performing calendar months. March also falls within the traditionally favorable <em>“best six months”</em> window <em>(November through April)</em>. Historically, this period outperformed the May–October stretch.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"paywall-full-content\"></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Seasonality-Monthly-Return-Stats-for-the-SP-500.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Monthly return stats for S&amp;P 500\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"700\" height=\"422\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Seasonality-Monthly-Return-Stats-for-the-SP-500.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Seasonality-Monthly-Return-Stats-for-the-SP-500.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Seasonality-Monthly-Return-Stats-for-the-SP-500.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Seasonality-Monthly-Return-Stats-for-the-SP-500.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, there is a critical asterisk: <strong>2026 is a midterm election year.</strong> Midterm years carry a well-documented pattern of elevated volatility and muted returns <strong>during the first half of the calendar year.</strong> According to Motley Fool, the S&amp;P 500 has returned an average of just +1% during midterm election years. It has also historically suffered an average intra-year drawdown of roughly 18%. When a new president takes office, as is the case now, the average midterm-year return drops to approximately ~7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the overall market, momentum indicators are <strong>deteriorating on the short-term time frame.</strong> However, they remain supportive on an intermediate- to long-term basis. The 14-day RSI stands at approximately 48. That is firmly in neutral territory, and well off the highs when the index was testing 7,000. The RSI is not yet oversold (below 30), which means the index has room to drift lower. Notably, the market is flirting with the bottom of its recent consolidation range and the 100-day moving average, where a break lower could draw more selling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Bottom line: </strong>The bull trend is intact, but the<em> “easy money”</em> phase appears mature. The intermediate-to-long-term structure remains constructive. The 200-DMA is rising, breadth is near record levels, and the rotation trade is broadening participation. However, short-term momentum has deteriorated notably. The index is below both its 20- and 50-DMAs, the MACD has crossed bearishly, and the RSI is declining. Layer in the midterm election year seasonal headwinds, hotter-than-expected inflation, and Iran-related geopolitical risk, and <em><strong>the path of least resistance in early March tilts toward further consolidation or a modest pullback before the seasonal tailwinds attempt to reassert themselves.</strong></em> I suspect we will get a better entry point for a rally as we move into March. However, use that opportunity to rebalance oversized winners, define risk levels, and avoid chasing strength. Don’t fight the trend, but protect gains if volatility inevitably returns.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><strong>Level Type</strong></td> <td><strong>Price Zone</strong></td> <td><strong>Technical Significance</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Immediate Resistance</strong></td> <td>6,950 – 7,000</td> <td>Psychological round-number resistance.

On the macro side, the week is bookended by two critical reads on the economy. ISM Manufacturing PMI lands Monday morning, after January’s surprise jump to 52.6 (the first expansion in 12 months), markets will scrutinize whether that rebound was genuine or simply a post-holiday reorder effect distorted by tariff front-running. A print below 50 would revive contraction fears and likely pressure cyclicals and small caps; a firm reading above 52 would reinforce the reflation narrative that has lifted Energy, Materials, and Industrials.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wednesday is the ADP Employment Report and ISM Services PMI. Services never entered contraction, and ADP has shown a recovery in employment as of late. Then on Friday, the February Employment Situation (Nonfarm Payrolls) caps the week and will set the tone heading into mid-March. The key number will be the wage growth component; if average hourly earnings accelerate, it could push out rate-cut expectations and weigh on rate-sensitive sectors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings will also move the market next week: <strong>CrowdStrike (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD\" title=\"CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc.\">CRWD</a>)</strong> reports after the close on Tuesday - the cybersecurity bellwether will offer a key read on enterprise security spend and the penetration of its Falcon Flex model. The market has priced in roughly a ±10% earnings move, so guidance will be the real catalyst. On Wednesday, <strong>Broadcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>)</strong> reports its fiscal Q1 2026 results with consensus revenue estimates near $19.2 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Focus will be squarely on AI semiconductor revenue (guided to $8.2B for the quarter), custom ASIC demand from hyperscalers, and infrastructure software margins. Given the recent selloff in semis, a strong guide-up could reignite the AI trade. Thursday is <strong>Costco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COST\" title=\"Costco Wholesale Corporation\">COST</a>)</strong> and <strong>Marvell Technology (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRVL\" title=\"Marvell Technology, Inc.\">MRVL</a>)</strong>, both reporting after the bell. Costco’s comparable sales trends and membership fee income will set the tone for the consumer, while Marvell’s data center revenue trajectory and Celestial AI integration update will add another data point to the AI infrastructure narrative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-186.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Events\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"844\" height=\"636\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-186.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-186.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-186.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-186.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-186.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Market Topping Process?

However, those growth names are where the earnings and revenue growth reside. With that in mind, the next rotation could be from defensive names back to growth names, which are now trading at significantly lower forward PEs. Such a rotation would be exactly what often happens, as no one currently expects it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-176.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Forward P/E\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"564\" height=\"417\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-176.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-176.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-176.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If it isn’t a market top, then is the recent rotation out of growth and into defensive sectors merely the kind of healthy digestion that precedes a further leg higher?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are the questions we will dig into today.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Case for a Top: What the Bears See</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The S&amp;P 500 has spent recent weeks grinding in a range that has tested the patience of both bulls and bears. More notable than the index’s headline price action has been the dramatic shift beneath the surface: utilities, healthcare, and consumer staples have led the tape, while the mega-cap technology stocks that powered the bulk of the post-2022 rally have stalled or retreated. The Nasdaq 100’s underperformance relative to the equal-weight S&amp;P 500 has reached levels not seen since the first quarter of 2022, a period that, it bears noting, preceded a punishing bear market leg.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_QQQ-vs-RSP-scaled.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1577\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_QQQ-vs-RSP-scaled.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Invesco S&amp;P 500\" width=\"1280\" height=\"986\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_QQQ-vs-RSP-scaled.png?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_QQQ-vs-RSP-scaled.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_QQQ-vs-RSP-scaled.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_QQQ-vs-RSP-scaled.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_QQQ-vs-RSP-scaled.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_QQQ-vs-RSP-scaled.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_QQQ-vs-RSP-scaled.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For market technicians, the pattern is uncomfortably familiar. Market-topping processes throughout history, from 2000 to 2007 to 2021, have been preceded by precisely this kind of internal deterioration: narrowing leadership, defensive outperformance, and a growing divergence between price-weighted and breadth-based indicators. The question is whether history is rhyming again, or whether the analogy is misleading.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most compelling argument that equities are in a market-topping process begins with the market’s internal structure. <strong>When investors rotate aggressively into utilities, staples, and healthcare sectors prized for their dividend yields and earnings stability rather than their growth prospects, it is typically a signal that institutional capital is seeking shelter.</strong> Money doesn’t move into Procter &amp; Gamble (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PG\" title=\"The Procter &amp; Gamble Company\">PG</a>) and Duke Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DUK\" title=\"Duke Energy Corporation\">DUK</a>) because portfolio managers are feeling adventurous. It moves there because they are seeking relative safety.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The breadth picture reinforces this concern. The percentage of S&amp;P 500 constituents trading above their 200-day moving average has been declining even as the index itself has held near its highs, a classic negative divergence. We also see the same negative divergence in the market’s relative strength measures. In past market-topping processes, such divergences have preceded meaningful corrections by 2 to 6 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SPY-Market-Breadth.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SPX chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"900\" height=\"673\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SPY-Market-Breadth.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SPY-Market-Breadth.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SPY-Market-Breadth.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SPY-Market-Breadth.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SPY-Market-Breadth.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then there is the yield curve. After a prolonged inversion that began in 2022, the curve’s re-steepening in late 2024 and into 2025 prompted some relief among investors who viewed the normalization as a sign the recession everyone feared had been avoided. But historically, the most dangerous period for equities is not during the inversion itself; it is in the 12 to 18 months after the curve un-inverts. The logic is straightforward: the curve steepens because the Fed is cutting rates in response to slowing growth, and the lagged effects of prior tightening are still working through the economy. By the time the damage becomes visible in earnings, the market-topping process has likely been completed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Yield-Curve-UnInversions.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Yield inversion reversals are recession signal\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"840\" height=\"518\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Yield-Curve-UnInversions.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Yield-Curve-UnInversions.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Yield-Curve-UnInversions.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Yield-Curve-UnInversions.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Yield-Curve-UnInversions.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, credit markets, while not yet flashing red, are showing early signs of strain. Investment-grade and high-yield spreads have widened modestly from their tightest levels, and dispersion within the high-yield market, particularly in private credit, has increased. Historically, credit leads equities, and the subtle deterioration in risk appetite in fixed income is difficult for equity bulls to dismiss entirely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Treasury-to-BAA-and-BB-spreads.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1663\" data-height=\"465\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Treasury-to-BAA-and-BB-spreads.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Treasury bond to yield spread\" width=\"1280\" height=\"358\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Treasury-to-BAA-and-BB-spreads.png?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Treasury-to-BAA-and-BB-spreads.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Treasury-to-BAA-and-BB-spreads.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Treasury-to-BAA-and-BB-spreads.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Treasury-to-BAA-and-BB-spreads.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Treasury-to-BAA-and-BB-spreads.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Treasury-to-BAA-and-BB-spreads.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But let’s also discuss the bull case.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Case for a Base: What the Bulls See</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bull case is not built on dismissing the rotation into defensives but on reframing it. Proponents of the view that the market is building a base, rather than a market-topping process, and point out that leadership transitions within a bull market are not inherently bearish. In fact, some of the healthiest and most durable advances in market history have been accompanied by exactly the kind of broadening and rotation currently underway.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consider the precedent of 2016. After a narrow, FANG-led rally in 2015, the market experienced a gut-wrenching correction in early 2016 driven by growth fears and an oil price collapse. What followed was not a bear market but a powerful rotation: value outperformed growth, small caps outperformed large caps, and the equal-weight index began to lead. As shown, that outperformance remained intact for nearly 36 months before it failed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-192.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SPX chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-192.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-192.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-192.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-192.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-192.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key distinction, then, is between rotation that signals deterioration and rotation that signals broadening. The former typically occurs alongside falling earnings estimates and rising unemployment claims. The latter occurs when the economy is resilient enough to support a wider set of winners.<strong> On this score, the fundamental backdrop remains constructive. </strong>Aggregate S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates for the forward twelve months have continued to grind higher, not lower, which is a crucial differentiator from the pre-recession environments of 2000 and 2007, when estimates were rolling over well before the index peaked.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-181.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2000\" data-height=\"1133\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-181.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EPS forward estimate\" width=\"1280\" height=\"725\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-181.png?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-181.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-181.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-181.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-181.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-181.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-181.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The labor market, while cooling from its post-pandemic tightness, has avoided the kind of abrupt deterioration that typically precedes a recession.

The Federal Reserve’s pivot toward accommodation, whether through actual rate reductions or a clear willingness to ease if conditions warrant, provides an important backstop. Historical analysis from Ned Davis Research shows that when the Fed eases into an environment of positive earnings growth, the S&amp;P 500 has posted gains in more than 80% of the subsequent 12-month periods. <strong>The combination of falling rates and rising earnings is, statistically, one of the most favorable macro regimes for equities.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The technical picture, while mixed, is not uniformly bearish either. The S&amp;P 500 remains above its rising 52-week (1-year) and 208-week (4-year) moving averages. That 52-week moving average has been a consistent bullish <em>“line in the sand”</em> that, when lost and confirmed, has historically been one of the most reliable signals that a cyclical bear market is underway. As long as that trend anchor holds, the benefit of the doubt arguably belongs to the bulls. <strong>The most important trend line is the 208-week moving average. If that fails, the bears will have control of the market.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SP-500-Weekly-Technical-Chart.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SPX chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1240\" height=\"928\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SP-500-Weekly-Technical-Chart.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SP-500-Weekly-Technical-Chart.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SP-500-Weekly-Technical-Chart.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SP-500-Weekly-Technical-Chart.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SP-500-Weekly-Technical-Chart.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_SP-500-Weekly-Technical-Chart.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, sentiment indicators have swung sharply toward pessimism during the recent rotation, with the AAII bull-bear spread, the put-call ratio, and the CNN Fear and Greed Index all at levels that historically don’t suggest a market-topping process is underway.

The ongoing buildout of artificial intelligence infrastructure, the reshoring of manufacturing supply chains, and the capital expenditure cycle across the energy transition represent multi-year tailwinds for corporate earnings that extend well beyond the mega-cap technology cohort. If the AI investment cycle is broadening from the hyperscalers to the enterprise software layer and the industrial economy, then the rotation could have further to go.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, which side do you pick?</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Verdict: Healthy Skepticism, Not Conviction</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Markets rarely announce their intentions clearly, and the current environment is no exception. The bearish case rests on pattern recognition, the eerie similarity between today’s internal deterioration and the breadth collapses that preceded the last three major market topping processes, and on the arithmetic of valuation, which suggests that the margin of safety for equity investors is thinner than it has been in over two decades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bullish case rests on fundamentals that remain, for now, constructive: earnings are growing, the Fed is friendly, the labor market is intact, and sentiment is depressed enough to provide contrarian fuel. History shows that expensive markets with rising earnings can stay expensive far longer than value-oriented bears expect, and that defensive rotations within a secular uptrend are more often buying opportunities than exit signals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The honest answer is that the market is at an inflection point where the evidence supports both interpretations. <strong>What will resolve the debate is not opinion, but price</strong>. As such, investors should pay close attention to key market levels, as noted in the Technical Update above.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em>The 100-day moving average remains a key bullish trend support.</em></li> <li><em>The 200-day moving average is a critical support level for markets during a corrective process.</em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the market breaks below the 100-day moving average, the market-topping process will likely be confirmed. If that happens, the next question for the bulls will be whether the S&amp;P 500 can hold its 200-day average. The bulls, on the other hand, will need to see the market eventually confirm all-time highs on broader participation. A bull market cannot last without the major sectors of Financials, Technology, and Healthcare providing support.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Bottom line:</strong> There is currently no evidence to suggest that the current rotation is the opening act of a more ominous distribution phase. However, that does not mean the evidence won’t eventually manifest. Therefore, investors who position dogmatically for a specific outcome are taking a lower-probability bet than those who remain flexible, watch the key levels, and let the tape itself provide the answer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the old market adage goes: <strong><em>the trend is your friend until it bends. </em></strong>The trend has not yet broken. But it is bending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Market Statistics &amp; Analysis</strong></h2> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>Weekly technical overview across key sectors, risk indicators, and market internals</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Market &amp; Sector X-Ray: Pullback To Support</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite what seemed like a market-topping process, most sectors and markets outside technology remain in overbought territory on a short-term basis. Energy, Materials, Industrials, and Staples, or rather <em>“value,”</em> have strongly outperformed every other market and sector this year. These areas are the most overbought, and a rotation back to growth seems increasingly obvious, but momentum is a hard thing to kill. Take profits and rebalance portfolios accordingly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Market-Sector-Relative-Performance-1.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1179\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Market-Sector-Relative-Performance-1.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Market-Sector-Relative-Performance-1.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Market-Sector-Relative-Performance-1.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Market-Sector-Relative-Performance-1.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Market-Sector-Relative-Performance-1.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_Market-Sector-Relative-Performance-1.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Technical Composite: 69.47 – Overbought Conditions Continue To Ease</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The overall technical condition remains bullish as the market remains stuck in a consolidation range. One argument against a market-topping process is that price consolidation is easing the previous overbought conditions. I continue to suspect we will get a better entry point for a rally as we get into March. However, as noted above, this weakness is very selective and is driven by Technology, Communications, and Financials. The next market rally will likely be driven by a rotation into these areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-197.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Technical composite\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1116\" height=\"570\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-197.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-197.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-197.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-197.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-197.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/3/1/saupload_image-197.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Fear/Greed Index: 72.80 – Greed Remains (In Certain Sectors)</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positioning in equities remained strong this week, driven by continued strength in Materials, Industrials, Staples, and Energy as noted above.

The moves may signal a diminishing appetite for risk-on assets as investors reassess growth expectations and adjust their economic outlooks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The new feature, <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-security\" rel=\"nofollow\">Claude Code Security</a>, scans codebases for security vulnerabilities and suggests patches, raising concerns that AI-driven development tools could reduce reliance on certain third-party solutions. The pullback has escalated the debate over AI displacement, with some seeing the advancements as threatening to cyber firms while others argue the market reaction has been largely panic-driven.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>“We believe these stocks selling off is all on the ‘AI Ghost Trade’ fears… but it will prove to be the wrong reaction in the long-term for clear winners such as Palo Alto, CrowdStrike, and Zscaler as they prove it out in 2026 in our view,” Wedbush analysts <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anthropic-claude-code-security-launch-200400637.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">said in a note</a>.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a sharp escalation on Friday, U.S. federal agencies were ordered to immediately cease using Anthropic’s technology following months of acrimonious disputes with the Pentagon. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/02/24/nx-s1-5725327/pentagon-anthropic-hegseth-safety\" rel=\"nofollow\">vowed</a> to blacklist Anthropic if the U.S. could not have unrestricted military use of its AI technology in a “lawful” manner, which included warfare and surveillance. In a Truth Social post, Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/116144552969293195\" rel=\"nofollow\">wrote</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>“...I am directing EVERY Federal Agency in the United States Government to IMMEDIATELY CEASE all use of Anthropic's technology. We don't need it, we don't want it, and will not do business with them again!\"</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The high-stakes AI battle happens to coincide on the heels of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558949-trump-confirms-us-began-major-combat-operation-against-iran\">airstrikes</a> carried out by Israel and the U.S. across Iran. Iran is a global oil producer and a founding member of OPEC. Ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran and three failed rounds of U.S.-Iran nuclear program talks have resulted in no deal, and now, the nations are engaging in major combat. Amid the news, OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, secured a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to deploy its models within a classified government network. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558951-openai-lands-pentagon-deal-after-anthropic-standoff\">stated</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>“Tonight, we reached an agreement with the Department of War to deploy our models in their classified network. In all of our interactions, the DoW displayed a deep respect for safety and a desire to partner to achieve the best possible outcome. Two of our most important safety principles are prohibitions on domestic mass surveillance and human responsibility for the use of force, including for autonomous weapon systems. The DoW agrees with these principles, reflects them in law and policy, and we put them into our agreement. We also will build technical safeguards to ensure our models behave as they should, which the DoW also wanted.”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we monitor the latest news and developments, for those seeking cybersecurity exposure, the recent volatility underscores the importance of focusing on fundamentals and quantitative metrics that remove emotion from investing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How I Chose Top Cybersecurity Stocks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I pulled holdings from the three largest cybersecurity-focused ETFs by assets under management and ran them through the Quant Ratings System.

Some analysts argue that AI will boost cybersecurity stocks in the long run and the market has overrated to the headlines.

The stock has more than tripled to current levels from the March lows of ~$6, despite giving back most<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> of its gains after spikes over $40 in October 2025, and another in January, which tested highs around ~$32.

During the first three quarters of 2025, no sales were recorded, while adjusted operating expenses have climbed from $8.8M in 2Q25 to $8.9M in 3Q25. This excludes the $3.2M in stock-based compensation, M&amp;A costs, and severance pay. The management expects 4Q25 adjusted OPEX to reach $13M-$15M, reflecting an accelerated hiring spree and commissioning activity at its Stillwater plant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we steer back to GAAP, we have to work with a noisy set of data. The net loss in 3Q25 was in fact $156.7M, or -$1.64 per share. This was mainly due to a $142M non-cash fair value adjustment on warrant and earn-out liabilities. In 2Q25, GAAP net loss was $142.5M, or -$1.54/share. The net loss is persistent with growing costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company finished the third quarter with $257.6M cash in hand and no significant debt. Operating cash flow burn was $21.1M during the first three quarters of 2025. Capex spend has been steadily increasing—$3M/$3.2M/$7.1M in 1Q/2Q/3Q of FY25. This was primarily for improving plant and equipment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recapitalization keeps it going</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In January 2026, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/usa-rare-earth-announces-closing-120100873.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">USAR closed</a> a $1.5B PIPE deal, and issued 69.8M shares at $21.50, with Inflection Point as the anchor investor. Later in the same month, the company <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/usa-rare-earth-enters-pact-for-1-6-billion-of-federal-funds-22626027\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> a non-binding letter of intent with the U.S. Department of Commerce's CHIPS program, which led to up to $1.6B in funding that consists of $277M in proposed grants and $1.3B in senior secured loans. In return, 16.1M shares and ~17.6M warrants were issued to the DoC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The obvious drawback is dilution. As of the end of January, there were ~217.9M in outstanding shares, with up to 76.3M shares listed for resale, or about 35% of the total float. The share dilution effect is a strong overhang on the stock, as evidenced by the 12% drop in the share price on the PIPE closing day.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reducing reliance on China's rare earth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's Stillwater plant in Oklahoma is a magnet manufacturing plant expected to be in commission in 1Q26. The initial production rate is 600 metric tons/annum (tpa), before scaling to 1200 tpa, and finally to a full capacity of 4,800 tpa.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">USAR acquired the UK's Less Common Metals (LCM) in November 2025 for $100M in cash and 6.54M in shares. This acquisition will bring in 1,500 tpa of NdFeB strip cast capacity, expanding to 2,000 tpa in 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fueled by geopolitical fears</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After China <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/consequences-chinas-new-rare-earths-export-restrictions\" rel=\"nofollow\">imposed</a> export controls on seven heavy rare earth elements in April 2025, it further expanded them in October 2025 and subsequently suspended the latter until November 2026. China's RE magnet exports fell by ~75% in the two months following the initial controls, and as a result, neodymium prices have <a href=\"https://strategicmetalsinvest.com/neodymium-prices/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener\">surged</a> roughly <span>124%</span> since January 2025, to $214.80/kg in February 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below is a neodymium price chart in CNY (¥).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49857933-17722791552274888_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"734\" data-height=\"418\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49857933-17722791552274888_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Neodymium price\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"364\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49857933-17722791552274888_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49857933-17722791552274888_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49857933-17722791552274888_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49857933-17722791552274888_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Neodymium price <span>(Trading Economics)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>USA Rare Earth's heavy critical minerals project is essential to restoring U.S. critical mineral independence.\"</p> <p>Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick (<a href=\"https://nam.org/commerce-department-injects-6-billion-into-domestic-rare-earths-35594/\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a>)</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not only is the funding pipeline credible, but it has garnered bipartisan support as it is a national urgency.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">But let's pause and look at fundamentals</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The gap between the company's aspirational <a href=\"https://investors.usare.com/static-files/504a8a9a-b867-4a1b-bee4-99b651cb0144\" rel=\"nofollow\">targets</a> (pp. 10) and execution is still pretty wide. By 2030, the management expects to hit $2.6B in revenue, $1.2B in EBITDA, and $900M in FCF. So far, market analysts have only put FY26E revenue at ~$51M, increasing to $281M in FY27E and to $858M in FY28E. EBITDA is not expected to turn positive until FY28E when it will reach $62M.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of 3Q25, the Stillwater plant has yet to produce its first magnet, let alone being able to manufacture at scale. Any further status update on its timeline to begin commissioning in 1Q26 would be welcome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its Round Top deposit in West Texas, which has heavy rare earths, gallium, and other critical minerals waiting to be extracted, still has to pass its pre-feasibility study, aimed to be done by 3Q26. Thus, we do not expect any revenue contribution here until at least 2028.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The economic viability of domestic RE producers rests strangely on the actions of China.</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As China's export control on REs has sparked urgency on domestic suppliers, the spigot is still very much under the control of China. A relaxation of its supply can cause rare earth prices to crash, as with any commodity. China has shown that it will use its dominance in rare earths as a negotiation tactic in trade talks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A competitive landscape</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MP Materials (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MP\" title=\"MP Materials Corp.\">MP</a>) is a larger competitor valued at $10.4B, has ~$276M in revenue in the past twelve months. It operates the sole active rare earth mine in North America. It also has close ties with the Department of War. However, USAR has an edge in heavy rare earths, which MP doesn't produce at scale. Despite this, MP still has multiple years of a head start and is expected to turn a profit as early as FY26E, according to market estimates.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation and Verdict</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At current levels, USAR trades at 36x FY26E earnings, which is high for an industrial miner, but possibly justifiable since rare earths are a sensitive, politicized commodity. Looking further out at $858M in FY28E revenue, the market estimates imply an FY28E P/S of 2.1x. We sense that this valuation is still on the expensive side—market estimates ($62M EBITDA on $858M revenue) imply a 29x FY28E EV/EBITDA multiple, whereas industrial miners tend to trade below 10x EV/EBITDA even during bull markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, dilution is a big overhang for the stock. There are still $280M+ of warrants to be exercised on the balance sheet. The <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1970622/000197062226000009/usar-20260128.htm\" rel=\"noopener\">SEC filings</a> contain risk factors that explicitly mention \"significant dilution associated with the expected U.S. Government investment and PIPE transaction.\" Management has indicated it will need additional capital to fund the full four-line buildout at Stillwater (at least $250M in capex plus $50M-$100M in working capital) and the Round Top development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We are not bearish on domestic rare earth suppliers due to geopolitical tailwinds, significant government support and funding, and ultimately the strategic importance of such minerals to defense, EVs, wind, and semiconductors. That said, current valuations are off-putting, and we believe more production milestones need to be reached for us to consider an investment that targets profitability in FY28+.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We rate USAR as a HOLD. We look forward to its next earnings release on March 19 to learn more about its progress at Stillwater.</p>",

SPYM is less popular than SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">SPY</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), but it is a very large and liquid ETF, with $107.6 billion in assets under management and an average daily volume of $923 million.

They are necessary for new readers to understand the metrics. If you are used to this series or if you are short of time, you can skip them and go to the charts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Base Metrics</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>I calculate the median value of five fundamental ratios in every sector: Earnings Yield (\"EY\"), Sales Yield (\"SY\"), Free Cash Flow Yield (\"FY\"), Return on Equity (\"ROE\"), Gross Margin (\"GM\"). All are calculated on trailing 12 months. For all these ratios, higher is better, and negative is bad. EY, SY and FY are medians of the inverse of Price/Earnings, Price/Sales and Price/Free Cash Flow. They are better for statistical studies than price-to-something ratios, which are unusable when the \"something\" is close to zero or negative (for example, companies with negative earnings). I also calculate two momentum metrics for each group: the median monthly return (RetM) and the median annual return (RetY).</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>I prefer medians rather than averages because a median splits a set into a good half and a bad half. Capital-weighted averages are skewed by extreme values and the largest companies. As a consequence, these metrics are designed for stock-picking rather than index investing.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Value and Quality Scores</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Historical baselines are calculated as the averages over a look-back period of 11 years for all metrics. They are noted respectively EYh, SYh, FYh, ROEh, GMh. For example, the value of EYh for technology in the table below is the 11-year average of the median Earnings Yield of S&amp;P 500 tech companies.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>The Value Score \"VS\" is the average difference in % between the three valuation ratios (EY, SY, FY) and their baselines (EYh, SYh, FYh). In the same way, the Quality Score \"QS\" is the average difference between the two quality ratios (ROE, GM) and their baselines (ROEh, GMh). </em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>VS may be interpreted as the percentage of undervaluation or overvaluation relative to the baseline (positive is good, negative is bad). This interpretation must be taken with caution: the baseline is an arbitrary reference, not a supposed fair value. The formula assumes that the three valuation metrics are of equal importance, except in energy and utilities, where the Free Cash Flow Yield is ignored to avoid some inconsistencies. VS and QS</em><em> are capped between -100 and +100</em><em> when the calculation goes </em><em>beyond </em><em>th</em><em>ese</em><em> value</em><em>s</em><em>.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Current data</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next table shows the metrics and scores as of writing.

class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Interpretation</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A hypothetical S&amp;P 500 median company is overvalued by 13% relative to historical averages since 2015. Its quality score is close to the historical baseline. Median valuation ratios calculated as the inverse of yields are as follows:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Price/Earnings: 27.47</li> <li>Price/Sales: 3.18</li> <li>Price/Free Cash Flow: 42.55</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The energy sector has the highest value and quality scores since <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4483198-ivv-sp-500-dashboard-for-february\">February 2022</a>. Real estate is undervalued by 13% based on 11-year averages and is close to its quality baseline. Healthcare is almost at its historical baseline regarding both value and quality. Consumer staples, communication, and financials are overvalued by less than 10%. Overvaluation may be offset by a good quality score for financials. Technology, consumer discretionary, and utilities are overvalued by 17% to 19%, with a good quality score for consumer discretionary and utilities. Industrials and materials are overvalued by 27% and 32%, respectively. The latter is the least compelling sector from a fundamental point of view, with both the lowest value and quality scores.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The S&amp;P 500 performance was significantly skewed by mega-caps in 2025, but the bias reversed recently to give quite balanced 12-month returns in the cap-weighted index (17% measured on SPYM), the equal-weight index (15.7% measured on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RSP\" title=\"Invesco S&amp;P 500 Eql Wght ETF\">RSP</a>) and the index median (13.3% reported in the table above).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The table above is not only useful to calculate value and quality scores. It may also help spot companies with attractive value relative to their peers. For example, the EY column tells us that a large consumer staples company with an earnings yield above 0.0364 (or price/earnings below 27.47) is in the better half of the sector regarding this metric. A dashboard list is sent every month to Quantitative Risk &amp; Value members with companies standing in the better half among their peers regarding the three valuation metrics. The companies listed below are part of the list sent to QRV members for March.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCL\" title=\"Carnival Corporation &amp; plc\">CCL</a></p></td> <td><p>Carnival Corp.</p></td> <td><p>DISCRETIONARY</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APA\" title=\"APA Corporation\">APA</a></p></td> <td><p>APA Corp.</p></td> <td><p>ENERGY</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PYPL\" title=\"PayPal Holdings, Inc.\">PYPL</a></p></td> <td><p>PayPal Holdings, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>FINANCIAL</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UHS\" title=\"Universal Health Services, Inc.\">UHS</a></p></td> <td><p>Universal Health Services, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>HEALTHCARE</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT\" title=\"Lockheed Martin Corporation\">LMT</a></p></td> <td><p>Lockheed Martin Corp.</p></td> <td><p>INDUSTRIAL</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEM\" title=\"Newmont Corporation\">NEM</a></p></td> <td><p>Newmont Corp.</p></td> <td><p>MATERIALS</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LW\" title=\"Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\">LW</a></p></td> <td><p>Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>STAPLES</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IT\" title=\"Gartner, Inc.\">IT</a></p></td> <td><p>Gartner, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>TECH</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EIX\" title=\"Edison International\">EIX</a></p></td> <td><p>Edison International</p></td> <td><p>UTIL</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is part of a larger rotational model with a positive bias on the long-term, not the result of in-depth stock analysis.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Cineplex has always been a story of divestment and deleveraging, something quite different from Marcus, as I showed you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But despite the good results, I told you I was targeting a range of $20 to $23.50 in one or two years. So, we still have an upside of ~20 to 25% until then, which, added to the mid-digit shareholder yield I was projecting, gives us a fairly large margin of safety.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, how's the thesis going?</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Theatres: Normalization in Sight?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although I, and a few other folks, have recently returned to the cinema, the narrative that many have tried to sell—that there will be a return to pre-pandemic numbers this year—is a lie.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we add up the <a href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/2025/?ref_=bo_yl_table_2\" rel=\"nofollow\">domestic box office</a> for the entire year, we arrive at something slightly above $8.6 billion (only 1% above 2024 but almost 24% below 2019).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">You could even argue that 2019 isn't such a comparable year, since many major releases came out, like Avengers: Endgame and The Lion King, but if you look back, in almost every pre-pandemic year the domestic box office exceeded $10 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772250741521367_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"730\" data-height=\"256\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772250741521367_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Domestic box office by year\" width=\"640\" height=\"224\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772250741521367_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772250741521367_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772250741521367_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772250741521367_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Domestic box office by year <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Besides not having normalized yet, the box office also hasn't reached the $9 billion projected by some <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/news/ni65043071/\" rel=\"nofollow\">analysts</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you ask me, I think more was expected from some films with old superhero formulas like Captain America and <a href=\"https://cosmicbook.news/superman-box-office-vs-batman-man-of-steel-fantastic-four\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superman</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Animated films like 'A Minecraft Movie' and 'Lilo &amp;

Even so, all should surpass $300 million in domestic box office (something that only six films managed to surpass last year).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on my estimates (considering Avengers: Doomsday will only be released in December), I think they could surpass that $9 billion estimate to something closer to $9.5 billion, with cheaper films (like The Housemaid and Wuthering Heights) boosting Gen Z and Millennial viewership.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But what about FY 2027?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Many say this year will be even better, with strong family titles like Frozen 3, Shrek 5 (that one I'll definitely want to see), and Minions 3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Could this be the catalyst to push domestic box office numbers above $10 billion? I wouldn't venture to say, but there's a chance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At Marcus, they achieved sales of $123.8 million in Q4 FY 2025, an increase of approximately 2.1% compared to the same period last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772251585869963.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Quarterly numbers\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"617\" height=\"422\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772251585869963.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772251585869963.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59215211-1772251585869963.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Press Release</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond the one-off effect of the release of the film '<a href=\"https://mkefilm.org/films/69459193a9fb3a42aed4908a\" rel=\"nofollow\">Song Sung Blue</a>' (a very important film for the Milwaukee community in particular), Marcus has been able to see revenue growth through pricing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you look at the KPIs for the quarter, visitation fell 5.7% and was fully offset by a 12.7% increase in the average ticket price. Along with that, F&amp;B per capita also jumped 7.2%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, they outperformed the national average by a good chunk of 760 bp.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notice that this isn't the traditional expansion (the kind we saw even before the pandemic) of organic growth via volume, nor the previous low-price strategies of afternoon matinees. This is a premiumization strategy, and, given the elasticity of demand, it's working quite well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we consider that small jump in the year's box office and Marcus achieving some gains in pricing and cross-selling on family films, I imagine that instead of Theatres revenue growing at a low-single-digit rate as it did in FY 2025, it will increase to a mid-single-digit rate (something between 4 and 6%), taking them to $481.2 to $490.4 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The big question would be the margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that premium push, they lifted the operating margin in the division from 4.9% to 6.3%. If that trend holds, mid-to-high-single-digit margins don't seem out of reach.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Answering the question I posed at the beginning of this section, if it happens, the normalization of box office revenue would occur in early 2027, with Marcus gaining market share while the industry continues to compete on price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How Paramount Helped Theatre Operators</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A piece of good news for theater operators that came out in the media today (February 27th, the day I'm writing this article) was the long-awaited Warner Bros. Discovery (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBD\" title=\"Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.\">WBD</a>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558365-paramount-wins-the-bidding-war-for-warner-bros-as-netflix-walks-away\">deal</a> with Paramount (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSKY\" title=\"Paramount Skydance Corporation\">PSKY</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And, to be honest, I didn't follow the intricacies of it. That's not exactly my area of ​​expertise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But since I cover Marcus and other operators in this industry, Paramount buying Warner Bros. instead of Netflix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX\" title=\"Netflix, Inc.\">NFLX</a>) saved them a lot of headaches.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To better understand this, we have to go back to David Ellison's <a href=\"https://www.screendaily.com/news/paramounts-david-ellison-commits-to-minimum-45-day-theatrical-window-in-letter-to-uk-creatives/5213433.article\" rel=\"nofollow\">statements</a> during the bidding war.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">He explicitly said:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>There will be a guaranteed minimum window of 45 days before releases go to streaming (more or less what it was in the post-pandemic period, when they reduced it from ~80 to 90 days);</li> <li>For major box office hits (I imagine films grossing over $300 million domestically), the idea is that the window should be 60 to 90 days;</li> <li>Paramount produces approximately 30 films annually for theatrical release.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at it bluntly, if they actually follow through on these promises, of course—this would extend Paramount's average window of ~30 days, which is more than a week shorter than the industry average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This all seems like a win for the establishment and, consequently, for Marcus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There's no doubt that Netflix would try its best to push very short windows, further shortening the theatrical lifespan of each film.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's fair to wonder if Paramount can maintain that volume of releases every year, like what happened with Disney (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) and Fox post-merger, but I think that's the lesser of two evils.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hotels: Smart Allocation and What to Expect in 2026</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hotels are also holding up well, especially assets that have just come out of renovations, like the Hilton Milwaukee.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you've read my write-ups on casinos like <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4867203-monarch-casino-capital-returns-today-potential-m-and-a-tomorrow\">Monarch</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCRI\" title=\"Monarch Casino &amp; Resort, Inc.\">MCRI</a>) and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4867488-boyd-gaming-2026-is-the-investment-year\">Boyd Gaming</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BYD\" title=\"Boyd Gaming Corporation\">BYD</a>), you'll know that the operators outperforming the national average are those that are constantly renovating their assets. One of the few local assets that hadn't been renovated, <a href=\"https://orleans.boydgaming.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Orleans</a>, hampered the entire segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Take the <a href=\"https://tourismanalytics.com/lasvegas-statistics.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Strip</a> as an example. Operators that aren't upscale are seeing a significant drop in ADR and, ultimately, RevPAR. But this is happening elsewhere too, like in the South (Houston is a good example) and even in the Midwest, where Marcus has most of its assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to data they revealed in the earnings call, in the U.S. RevPAR increased by only 0.8% (ADR-driven, of course), and in the Midwest, Marcus's competing hotels fell by 2% in FY 2025 as a whole.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the numbers they pulled in the last quarter, you can see they outperformed the national average by a large chunk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ADR increased 5.6% (driven by renovations and premiumization of certain assets), and occupancy fell only 1.2% to 60.2%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Marcus aimed and hit the 'k-shaped economy' at a very opportune time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">RevPAR grew 3.5%, about 550 bp higher than competitors in the Midwest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">You can also see the full-year effects of the renovations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With rooms closed part of the year, Hotels revenue grew only 2.6% in the full FY 2025, with the adjusted EBITDA margin remaining virtually flat year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Okay, but if they premiumized their room offering, why did margins shrink?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's simple. Some rooms remained closed during the renovation period, as well as certain areas like the convention center and part of the lobby. Since fixed costs remained stable, it's understandable that they would be less diluted while assets are under renovation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the entire FY 2026, management expects RevPAR growth in the low-single-digits, more or less stable with Q4 FY 2025 (likely with some pressure on occupancy and ADR increasing). But the difference here is that bookings for this year are ~3% higher than FY 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If I had to make a definitive prediction here, I'd say revenue would continue to grow in the low-to-mid single digits ($304 to $312.9 million) and margins would be slightly fatter compared to last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike other hotel chains, the World Cup won't be a huge boost here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Only Kansas City was chosen to host games, and since Marcus hasn't had properties there since 2015 (it sold the Phillips Hotel to focus on other markets), we probably won't see a very strong increase in bookings.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Good Old Cash Generation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, my midpoint revenue projections for FY 2026 are approximately $800 million, closely matching the consensus of $796.5 million that Wall Street is targeting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since they've been surprised every quarter recently, I'd say I'll stick with my projection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Premiumization efforts should push the EBITDA margin to ~13% (it's been hovering at 12.8% for the last two years), which would give us a full-year EBITDA of $104 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using the same 85% conversion rate I used in the last analysis, we could project an OCF of $88.4 million. That time we needed to project Capex, but now we know it should be between $50 and $55 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This slightly reduces our previous FCF projection of $40 to $45 million to $33.4 to $38.4 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even so, if we project dividends of $0.32 per share annually (a return of $9.8 million counting on the 30.7 million shares outstanding), they would be covered at ~3.6x the midpoint of the FCF.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If they use another $10 million to repurchase shares at ~$20 per share (being a little more conservative here), they would repurchase and retire 500,000 shares (buyback yield of just over 1.6%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We are still left with a low-to-mid-single-digit shareholder yield. But since I believe they will soon increase dividends back to what they were before the pandemic, I'm aiming for a mid-single-digit yield very soon.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still Cheap?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even though I think my previous price target of $20 to $23.50 is quite current, I believe we could take a look at the P/CF since these numbers are right in front of us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming the buybacks do reduce the outstanding shares to 30.2 million and the OCF comes in at $88.4 million (OCF per share of $2.92), Marcus's 5-year average multiple indicates that they usually trade at ~8.2x that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you look at the pre-pandemic period and imagine a scenario of normalization ahead, the price target is only slightly above my projections at ~$23.90 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will reiterate my '<strong>Buy</strong>' rating on Marcus, eyeing this minimum 20% upside and a low-to-mid-single-digit shareholder yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unless we head into a recession, the combination of a strong FY 2026–FY 2027 film slate and ongoing hotel premiumization makes this investment case look less risky from here. I also support the M&amp;A thesis in the Midwest given the low leverage of the balance sheet.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
