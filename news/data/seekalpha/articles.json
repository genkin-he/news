It’s a value ETF that owns some of America’s fastest-growing dividend stocks. I also added Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHD\" title=\"Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF™\">SCHD</a>) for its yield. While it may have a slower growth profile than CGDV, it brings a lot more stability and lower volatility to the table. Also, it has a much better income profile, which is key for a portfolio with an average target yield of 5.50%. To further improve the income, I added the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIVO\" title=\"Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF\">DIVO</a>), which uses a very conservative covered call strategy to juice the income of the portfolio without adding substantial options risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For that reason, I also added the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JEPQ\" title=\"JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF\">JEPQ</a>), which applies a covered call strategy to technology stocks. Given the elevated valuation of these stocks and increasing competition risks between the \"big guys,\" I believe a covered call strategy makes a lot of sense in this area going forward. Also, because of higher volatility, the options premiums are much higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last but not least, I added higher income through the Alerian MLP ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMLP\" title=\"Alerian MLP ETF\">AMLP</a>), which owns midstream Master Limited Partnerships, and the VanEck Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFXF\" title=\"VanEck Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF\">PFXF</a>), which is a bond proxy due to the high correlation between preferred equities and long-term government bonds.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"974\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616536214834552_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Portfolio Visualizer</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my prior article, I did not backtest the model portfolio, which was a huge error. <span class=\"highlighted_text\">Using the iShares Select Dividend ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DVY\" title=\"iShares Select Dividend ETF\">DVY</a>) as a benchmark, we see that since December 2022</span>, the model portfolio has returned 16.6% per year, more than 600 basis points above the 10.22% return of the benchmark ETF.

Nonetheless, it’s data that confirms my thesis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, I’ll make good on my promise and show you my picks for the other half of the 50/50 model portfolio. I will show you how we can use single stocks to add value and which companies I would pick. Needless to say, it’s just food for thought. As I explained in my ETF and so many other articles, every investor is different. I just provide the framework that can help people build their own portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, let’s get to it!</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Things To Keep In Mind After Laying A Strong Foundation of ETFs</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thanks to a strong ETF foundation, we can now add value by adding single stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But how do we do that? Buying random dividend stocks can hardly be the solution, as we already have a basket of diversified dividend income and dividend growth stocks in the ETF part of the portfolio. We need to find something special to add value. If we fail to do that, we may as well make this a 70%, 80%, or even 100% ETF portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, needless to say, we need to keep a few things in mind:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>We need to prevent too much overlap. It’s tough, given how much diversification we have, but it’s doable.</li> <li>We need to focus on the qualities we usually incorporate. This includes healthy dividend payout ratios, strong balance sheets, and business models that provide these companies with an edge. I’m not using the words \"wide moat\" here because REITs and some other good income stocks have no moats (capital is often the only constraint in the real estate business), yet they have other advantages that make them good investments.</li> <li>We need a consistently rising income to protect our income against inflation.</li> <li>We need to be aware that adding too many single stocks defeats the purpose of the 50/50 portfolio. We should stick to our highest-conviction ideas. However, we should also avoid adding too few stocks. For example, giving stock XYZ a 20% weighting would make it as important as the entire SCHD ETF in the model portfolio.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Personally, I would use various buckets to get a better overview of what we’re looking for and to make sure we maintain prudent diversification. For example, when I wrote about my retirement pyramid strategy, I used the overview below. I used three baskets with very different requirements for income and growth.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"1020\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"408\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616538123558707_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Leo Nelissen</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the pyramid strategy is mainly used on growth and income differences, the situation in this article is a bit more complex, as we don’t sort based on income and yield but on structural differences between stocks and the ETFs the model portfolio already owns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Personally (you may go into a different direction), I would go with the following buckets:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>I would go with a core of proven dividend compounders. These can be similar to the ones that SCHD owns, with yields of 3-5% and above-inflation dividend growth. Let’s call this the Stability Core.</li> <li>Then, I would go with a group of stocks that do not yet have a great ETF to represent them. These are essential infrastructure and energy stocks for inflation-resistant income and higher income. We can call this Hard Asset Value (or something else, as this is just a placeholder name for simplicity).</li> <li>I would obviously include Income Boosters, which are high-yield stocks that may not always have moats but have strong and safe income to improve the overall income and safety profile of the portfolio.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, I would track the Core &amp; Satellite method here, which I discussed in a recent <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4817645-the-only-retirement-investing-strategy-i-would-trust-with-my-future\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4817645-the-only-retirement-investing-strategy-i-would-trust-with-my-future\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>. While it’s a bit different from what we are doing here, the strategy is based on building a strong framework of low-cost ETFs and/or stocks and using specific investments to improve the risk/reward of the portfolio through very targeted investments.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"856\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"428\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761653848690977_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Leo Nelissen</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that in mind, let’s look into the actual picks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The \"Forever\" Dividend Stocks I Would Buy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you’re one of my more frequent readers, you will see a lot of companies that I bring up from time to time, as this isn’t an article to become creative and simply discuss random stocks for the sake of coverage diversity (I never do that, to be honest).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although every stage of the wealth-building process is key, retiring means being reliant financially on one’s financial assets.

That company is Realty Income (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/O\" title=\"Realty Income Corporation\">O</a>), the largest net lease REIT in the United States, with a focus on single-tenant assets occupied by operators in areas that are mostly anti-cyclical and protected against e-commerce disruption.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1666\" data-height=\"932\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616540211637685_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Realty Income</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Realty Income may be boring, yet when buying income, that’s great, as it yields 5.4% with more than 30 years of consecutive annual dividend hikes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, the dividend, which is paid quarterly (some really like that), has a five-year CAGR of 3.6%.

VICI is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vici_Properties\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vici_Properties\" target=\"_blank\">the result</a> of the Caesars Entertainment Corporation. It resulted in a spin-off of major properties. Later, it also bought its largest peer, MGM Growth Properties, becoming a company that basically owns most iconic buildings on the Las Vegas Strip, where it generates half of its total rent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its assets include Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Caesars Palace, The Venetian Las Vegas, and many others that create the only major REIT with non-commoditized assets.

Many BDCs have been aggressive funders of software operations, which now exposes them to severe AI disruption, as I wrote in a recent <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824776-single-biggest-risk-for-bdcs-nobody-is-talking-about\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824776-single-biggest-risk-for-bdcs-nobody-is-talking-about\" target=\"_blank\">article</a>. As you can see on page 24 of this investor <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_1b8ce2882772fbe3248825d2affa0489/mainstcapital/db/396/10973/pdf/Q2+2025+MAIN+Investor+Presentation+-+vF+-+FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_1b8ce2882772fbe3248825d2affa0489/mainstcapital/db/396/10973/pdf/Q2+2025+MAIN+Investor+Presentation+-+vF+-+FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">presentation</a>, its largest segment is machinery, accounting for 16% of its portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving over to hard asset value, I can keep this super straightforward. Here, I would own the most mission-critical players in infrastructure. This includes energy midstream infrastructure like pipelines and processing assets, large-scale infrastructure like toll roads, ports, power distribution, and even Class I railroads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we exclude MLPs, which we already own in the ETF part of the model portfolio, I would suggest American companies like ONEOK (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKE\" title=\"ONEOK, Inc.\">OKE</a>), which has a liquids-focused pipeline footprint in the South, and Antero Midstream (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AM\" title=\"Antero Midstream Corporation\">AM</a>), which owns the gathering and processing assets of Antero Resources (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AR\" title=\"Antero Resources Corporation\">AR</a>) in Appalachia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OKE yields 6.0% due to a weak oil price. While ONEOK’s business mostly consists of fixed-fee revenue, the stock tends to sell off when oil prices weaken. As it aims for 3-4% long-term dividend growth, this is a huge opportunity, as I expect a lot more demand for pipelines in America’s hottest energy region in the years ahead.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1536\" data-height=\"846\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"353\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-17616543596758008_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ONEOK</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833570-my-favorite-2-stock-combo-for-next-decade\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833570-my-favorite-2-stock-combo-for-next-decade\" target=\"_blank\">Antero Midstream</a> yields 5.0%.

I would include it because of its wide-moat footprint in the DIY housing space, which <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833229-coiled-spring-betting-on-my-top-picks-for-americas-next-housing-boom\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833229-coiled-spring-betting-on-my-top-picks-for-americas-next-housing-boom\" target=\"_blank\">I expect to benefit</a> from efforts to unlock the housing market, among its brilliant supply chain operations, and bigger push into the <a href=\"https://ir.homedepot.com/news-releases/2025/06-30-2025-130354727\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.homedepot.com/news-releases/2025/06-30-2025-130354727\" target=\"_blank\">PRO segment</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, while it’s not cheap, I would include RTX Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTX\" title=\"RTX Corporation\">RTX</a>), which has both defense and commercial aerospace exposure. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831529-rtx-my-biggest-defense-investment-just-went-boom\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831529-rtx-my-biggest-defense-investment-just-went-boom\" target=\"_blank\">I think</a> the company will continue to return double digits every year. It now yields 1.5% with a five-year CAGR of 6.9% that I expect to increase due to strong earnings growth and accelerating free cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, I would include some AI exposure here. Unfortunately, these are rather expensive right now, which is why I would likely stick to proven companies like Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>). It yields just 0.3% but has proven to be able to both stand out in the LLM AI model space and use its massive installed base of billions of daily users to turn its advantage into high earnings growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, what’s the bottom line?</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Portfolio Overview &amp; Closing Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now comes another fun thing, which is putting everything together.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below, I highlighted all the companies I mentioned. I included their yields and the average weighted yield. For that, I used the weighted yield contribution. You can ignore that, as it’s for calculation purposes only.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Please note that the weighting is 100%. If we combine it with ETFs, that number obviously becomes 50%, and all weightings are cut in half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we can see, the average yield is 5.5% because the majority of the portfolio is invested in O, VICI, MAIN, OKE, and AM. This means that single stocks heavily compete with the weighting of some major ETFs. It’s not perfect for diversification, but it shows that if we want to include faster-growing stocks, we either need to change the ETF composition or accept that some stocks get a bigger weighting. As I went with ultra-high-quality companies, I am not too worried about this weighting.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1714\" data-height=\"648\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"242\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/31557165-1761654505527929_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Leo Nelissen</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest risk here is MAIN’s 17% weighting.

AMLP yields 8.3%, while AM 5.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having said that, the results reflected in the chart above clearly show that AM has some embedded growth engines that are certainly worth taking into the equation when making a decision whether AM should really be so easily avoided for income investors even though the yield difference seems indeed quite material. After all, buying a growth business with a yield of ~5% should be something that is certainly worth a closer look for almost any income investor</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, given this and the fact that AM just recently issued a Q3 <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_1eaefacf739f3becdea63f12f778b175/anteromidstream/db/793/8050/pdf/AM+3Q25+Earnings+Call+Presentation_vF_10.30.25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">earnings package</a> that indicates robust growth, I have become bullish on this stock, where the underlying case boils down to resilient cash flows and truly sustainable dividend at a reasonable price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The recent earnings report contains strong messages across the board.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The year-over-year EBITDA increased by 11%, driven by organic growth (maintenance and growth CapEx) and previously made bolt-on acquisitions. However, I would say that the former component was the biggest contributor to the registered growth because of 99%+ uptime availability, 5% growth in compression volumes and 100% utilization rate on processing and fractionation activity. In other words, we could not have asked for something better on the operational side than what was achieved by AM in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, if we look at the cash flow dynamics, we will notice an uptick of 94% in the FCF generation (measured on a year-over-year basis). Given that the dividends have not changed over the past 12 months and while the EBITDA is indeed higher, we are obviously not talking about high double-digit figures; the only explanation that we have for this massive surge in the FCF generation is the reduced CapEx spend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And this is where things become interesting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The estimated total CapEx spend for 2025 is $180 million, which is roughly 4x below the average level in 2017 - 2019 period. At the same time, the full year EBITDA target for AM is slightly above $1.1 billion. Looking at the TTM figures, we can see that ~$200 million of the EBITDA result goes towards servicing debt, $180 million to CapEx and $435 million to dividends. This brings the dividend coverage to about 1.7x, which is already after CapEx and debt service coverage. And the surplus here is roughly $300 million that AM can retain in its books each year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Theoretically, this attractive story could be destroyed by an aggressive capital structure that would require AM to dedicate all of the excess cash flows toward debt reduction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the real situation is the complete opposite. As of Q3 2025, AM carried a leverage of 2.8x, which is for sure one of the lowest levels in the entire midstream space. The balance sheet is just as competitive as for EPD. The good thing here is that AM has no debt maturities until 2028, and the notes that stand first in line for refinancings in 2028 and 2029 have a cost of debt at ~5.5% (on a weighted average terms), which implies no meaningful headwinds after the rollovers are made.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So going forward, we should expect either intensified buybacks or additional bolt-on M&amp;A, where both are obviously accretive to the shareholders, especially considering the already optimized capital structure, where going lower would really not make sense from the value creation perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, I highly doubt that we will see further deleveraging (in a material way) given so strongly capitalized balance sheet, ample cash generation over dividends, and inherently de-risked top-line factor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of the top-line factor, we have to appreciate AM's revenue linkage to fixed contracts. Today, AM has absolutely no commodity risk present in its cash generation profile, as all of the income stems from fixed-fee contracts that are further <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_1eaefacf739f3becdea63f12f778b175/anteromidstream/db/793/8039/pdf/AM+Website+Presentation+August+2025_08.05.25_vF.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">hedged</a> by an accretive collar on the production volume front.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And, obviously, it is not only about the fixed, fee-based contracts but also about the underlying demand in the areas in which AM operates. As opposed to many peers, AM carries a significant focus on natural gas through its gathering and compression, processing and fractionation operations. Namely, there is no exposure to pure-play crude oil segments, which have become risky given the declining oil price over the past couple of quarters. Instead, AM's key business exposures allow it to directly participate in the structurally <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/global-natural-gas-demand-growth-set-to-accelerate-in-2026-as-more-lng-supply-comes-to-market\" rel=\"nofollow\">growing</a> natural gas area, that is mostly driven by the booming AI and the corresponding need for reliable baseload energy. In this context, we have to take into account AM's notable footprint in the Marcellus in which there is an elevated production activity due to extremely competitive <a href=\"https://info.evaluateenergy.com/low-breakevens-keep-marcellus-on-top/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">break-evens</a> for producers. This is clearly supportive for long-term and healthy demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, it seems that the market has also appreciated these aspects and baked into the cake a rather robust growth outlook for AM:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1533\" data-height=\"202\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"EPS growth\" width=\"640\" height=\"84\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"84\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49926601-17618460056855257_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, it makes perfect sense given the fundamental tailwinds that I described above.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bottom line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, I think that it would be fair to say that AM can be deemed as one of the most defensive midstream picks in the entire sector. When it comes to the leverage and distribution coverage, the situation is just as strong as for my top pick - EPD. In fact, AM is actually superior to EPD on the cash-flow predictability front due to its advantage of having 100% of the top-line linked to fee-based contracts, which is not the case for EPD.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, AM trades at EV/EBITDA of 10.2x, which is just by 0.1x lower than for EPD. PAA, WES and ET trade at 9.0x, 8.7x and 8.3x, respectively, which is by 10% to 15% cheaper. Having said that, none of them have the capitalized balance sheet and cash flow durability factors of AM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So the only thing that again makes the decision difficult for me (as a pure income investor) is the yield component. As stated above, the difference between rather similar (slightly lower quality but still defensive enough and sufficiently de-risked) midstream players and AM is about 3.2%, which is something that can move the needle. Also, in AM's recent <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_1eaefacf739f3becdea63f12f778b175/anteromidstream/db/793/8039/pdf/AM+Website+Presentation+August+2025_08.05.25_vF.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">investor presentation</a>, there are no indications of dividend hikes. Instead, the focus is put on buybacks and bolt-on M&amp;A, which is certainly supportive for price, but not necessarily dividend. Actually, if the price continues to go up and the dividend remains unchanged, the reinvestment yield will drop even further (e.g., below 5%).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having said that, given the \"best of breed\" fundamental profiles in the space and relatively attractive initial yield, I have decided to make a slight allocation into AM.</p>",

Despite the recent deal, appetite to add inorganic growth remains intact if opportunities open up. </span><span>However, currently no formal processes are underway. The collaboration with YPF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YPF\" title=\"YPF Sociedad Anónima\">YPF</a>) in La Amarga Chica drives operational synergies. </span><span>Overall, Vista executed efficiently with no surprises. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>The upcoming Investor Day on 12 November 2025 will outline the updated 2026+ strategy, cost initiatives, and long-term growth targets. For me, this will be even more important than the recent Q3 earnings release. Argentina’s elections are not seen as disruptive, having paved the way for operational growth and further stock price gains. The focus remains on profitable scale-up, cost discipline, and cash generation in a dollarized, export-oriented model, strengthening and de-risking the case.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vista remains far from cheap with a forward PE ratio of less than 9x. On an EV / operating cash flow basis, the multiple is around 10x – but using the working-capital depressed figure. I am using operating CF here instead of FCF, as Vista is pushing hard for growth, reinvesting every penny they can.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks To My Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see mainly two risks: the first being a significantly lower oil price. Gas likewise plays a role, but Vista is mainly an oil producer, as we've seen above. Despite low production costs, lower energy prices and thus operating results could become uncomfortable at some point due to the currently more leveraged balance sheet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Point number two, obviously any negative news from the political landscape in Argentina. This includes issues with public finances, like recently, which can send all stocks tied to Argentina down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I mentioned two risks, but a smaller third one could be if Vista pursues more acquisitions, especially when debt financed. This could weaken the balance sheet, and with it the equity portion of the enterprise value – the stock price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I reiterate my \"strong buy\" rating for Vista Energy. The recent challenges and confusions, especially from the political front, seem to be solved, at least for now. Further, Vista continues to excel operationally, having reached full export price parity. Production costs remain low, creating a strong buffer in the current environment of low oil prices. If and when oil prices turn up, Vista will be swimming in cash.</p>",

That's probably not a surprise.</p> <p>After all, companies with shareholder-oriented cultures and strong fundamentals tend to reward<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> shareholders year in and year out.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And why not? It's easy to do so when earnings are steadily climbing higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, I'm looking for companies with many more years of earnings growth than decline (depending on the industry and the business cycle, at least 8 or 9 out of the last 10 years is preferable).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment-grade (BBB- and up from S&amp;P and Fitch or Baa3 or higher from Moody's) credit ratings from rating agencies are also what I'm seeking. That provides businesses with a low cost of capital, which can make it easier to sustain earnings growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I want to cover businesses trading at appealing valuations. This brings us to the subject of today, which is the human capital management solutions provider, Paychex (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PAYX\" title=\"Paychex, Inc.\">PAYX</a></span>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I last covered Paychex with a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4716161-paychex-a-reliable-buy-for-growing-dividend-checks-now\">buy rating in August 2024</a>, I thought it could realistically achieve high-single-digit annual adjusted diluted EPS growth. I also liked the company's financial positioning. Lastly, I estimated shares were modestly undervalued.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fast forward to now, and we're reiterating our buy rating. Paychex's acquisition of Paycor in April is going well thus far, which reinforces our growth projections. The company's leverage ratio is exceptional, too. Finally, shares are also arguably more discounted now than they were 14 months ago.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Paychex Is Executing At A High Level</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1451\" data-height=\"758\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Paychex's financial highlights for the fiscal first quarter ended August 31st, 2025.\" width=\"640\" height=\"334\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"334\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Paychex Q1 2026 Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On September 30th, Paychex released its earnings report for the fiscal first quarter ended August 31st, 2025. The company's total revenue jumped 16.8% year-over-year to $1.54 billion in the quarter. For more context, that matched Seeking Alpha's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500166-paychex-non-gaap-eps-of-1_22-beats-by-0_02-revenue-of-1_54b-in-line\">analyst consensus</a> during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The driving force of this topline growth had to do with <a href=\"https://investor.paychex.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/791/paychex-completes-acquisition-of-paycor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paychex's acquisition of Paycor HCM</a> in April. The latter acquired the former for $4.1 billion. Strategically, this acquisition strengthened its competitive position upmarket by uniting the two to form an AI-enabled technology provider with top-notch service and advisory capabilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Digging deeper, Paychex's Management Solutions segment revenue soared 21% over the year-ago period to $1.16 billion for the first quarter. Of that amount, the company estimates that roughly 17% of the segment's topline growth was fueled by the aforementioned deal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to CFO Robert Schrader's opening remarks during the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4826950-paychex-inc-payx-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">Q1 2026 Earnings Call</a>, higher revenue per client played into this growth. This was made possible by improved price realization and increased product penetration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Paychex's PEO and Insurance Solutions increased by 3.1% year-over-year to $329.1 million in the first quarter. An uptick in the number of average PEO worksite employees was the primary driver of this topline growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interest on funds held for clients surged 26.9% over the year-ago period to $47.6 million. That mostly stemmed from higher average investment balances due to the Paycor acquisition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shifting gears to the bottom line, Paychex's adjusted diluted EPS grew by 5.2% over the year-ago period to $1.22 during the first quarter. That was $0.02 ahead of the analyst consensus for the quarter (the 19th quarter out of the last 20 it has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PAYX/earnings\">matched or exceeded</a> the analyst adjusted diluted EPS consensus). As the company was in the early stages of working Paycor into its business, its non-GAAP net profit margin contracted by 330 basis points to 28.6% in the quarter. This is why Paychex's adjusted diluted EPS growth lagged total revenue growth during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, the company should have plenty of growth ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's because Paychex's integration of Paycor is going well, with it set to exceed its initial cost synergy target of $90 million for FY 2026. The company is also pursuing incremental synergies beyond this target while reinvesting those gains for further growth and innovation investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the revenue synergy side of the equation, the integration has also been encouraging. President and CEO John Gibson noted that the company closed an ASO cross-sale to a Paycor client with several thousand employees. That was among the largest in Paychex's history.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For these reasons, we're inclined to think that the FAST Graphs analyst consensus is in the ballpark, if not a bit low. For FY 2026, adjusted diluted EPS is anticipated to rise by 9.8% to $5.47. In FY 2027, another 7.6% increase in adjusted diluted EPS to $5.89 is projected. For FY 2028, an additional 5.6% growth in adjusted diluted EPS is being predicted (this will likely rise as more analysts provide their forecasts for the fiscal year).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1450\" data-height=\"770\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A summary of Paychex's liquidity position and net leverage ratio as of August 31st, 2025.\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Paychex Q1 2026 Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financially, Paychex is a financially sound enterprise. As of August 31st, 2025, the company's net leverage ratio was 1.2x. This is what earns Paychex a BBB+ S&amp;P credit rating with a stable outlook. That arguably sets it up to opportunistically execute what it views as complementary acquisitions (similar to Paycor) down the road (unless otherwise sourced or hyperlinked, all info in this subhead was according to <a href=\"https://investor.paychex.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/809/paychex-inc-reports-first-quarter-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paychex's Q1 2026 Earnings Press Release</a> and <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_3d71fd2564896520cc343e0da5538808/paychex/db/883/8146/investor_presentation/Q1+FY26+Investor+Slides+Final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paychex's Q1 2026 Earnings Presentation</a>).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fair Value Could Be Above $150 A Share</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1661\" data-height=\"835\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PAYX in FAST Graphs.\" width=\"640\" height=\"322\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"322\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FAST Graphs, FactSet</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the last 14 months, shares of Paychex have only gained 1%. In our view, this modest performance only further enhances the stock's appeal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Paychex's shares are priced at a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 22. According to data from FAST Graphs, that's comfortably below the 10-year average P/E ratio of 27.9 (this was up incrementally from 27x as of August 2024).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving forward, we believe that a rational fair value P/E ratio for Paychex remains at around 27. What is our rationale?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, Paychex's profit margins are continuing to expand. The 28.6% non-GAAP net profit margin in Q1 2026 that we cited earlier is up significantly from 24.5% in <a href=\"https://investor.paychex.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/668/paychex-inc-reports-first-quarter-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q1 2021</a>. All else equal, a more profitable company supports our fair value P/E ratio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's more, Paychex's growth profile looks to be intact. For one, the FAST Graphs analyst consensus of $5.47 in adjusted diluted EPS for FY 2026 is higher than the consensus of $5.29 in August 2024. As is the consensus for FY 2027 of $5.89 for FY 2027 (it was $5.60 in FY 2026).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, the company's annual forward growth consensus is currently 7.3%. Considering that Paychex tends to beat adjusted diluted EPS expectations, this is comparable to the 10-year average annual growth rate of approximately 10%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of now, FY 2026 is about 41% complete. This leaves another 59% of FY 2026 and 41% of FY 2027 yet to come over the next 12 months. That produces a forward 12-month adjusted diluted EPS input of $5.64.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plugging this into our fair value P/E ratio of 27, we get a fair value of $152 a share. Relative to the current $124 share price (as of October 28th, 2025), this equates to a 19% discount to fair value. If Paychex matches growth forecasts and returns to fair value, it could generate a 27% total return by the end of November 2026. Through May 2031, it could post 13% annual total returns.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">More Strong Dividend Growth On The Horizon</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1541\" data-height=\"168\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PAYX in the Zen Research Terminal.\" width=\"640\" height=\"70\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Dividend Kings' Zen Research Terminal</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Paychex's 3.5% forward dividend yield comes in well above the 1.5% median forward yield of the industrials sector and the 1.3% yield of the technology sector. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PAYX/dividends/yield\">Seeking Alpha's Quant System</a> groups the company in the industrials sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, it's arguably now more of a technology sector stock with its tech-driven HCM platform and recurring software as a service revenue profile. That's why we'll provide info for each sector, but we would consider technology to be the more appropriate classification. This sizable starting yield is enough for the Quant System to issue an A- grade for overall dividend yield (unchanged from August 2024).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Better yet, Paychex's outsized starting income looks to be secure. The company's adjusted diluted EPS payout ratio is expected to be in the high-70% to low-80% range for FY 2026. This is above the 60% payout ratio that rating agencies like to see from the industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the higher payout ratio is more stable than it may initially seem. That's because Paychex is a free cash flow machine, with the free cash flow payout ratio anticipated to be in the low- to mid-70% range in FY 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not to mention the very low net leverage ratio on the balance sheet. From our perspective, these elements support the current payout ratio. This backs up the Quant System's A- grade for overall dividend safety (also unchanged from August 2024).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's why we also believe that Paychex can sustain high-single-digit annual dividend growth over at least the next several years. This jives with the Quant System's forward annual dividend growth per share forecast of 8.8%. That would be well above the industrial sector median of 6.4% (and the tech median of 6.5%). This warrants a B grade from the Quant System for this particular metric (also unchanged from August 2024).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's why we're confident that Paychex can build on its 14-year dividend growth streak. This itself is already more established than the industrial sector median of 3 years (and the tech sector median of 2.1 years). That explains the Quant System's A grade for overall dividend consistency.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks To Consider</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Paychex is a business with robust fundamentals. Yet, some risks could undermine the investment thesis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I outlined 14 months ago, one key risk to Paychex is that it's effectively a United States pure play. In its FY 2025, ended in May, only about 1% of its total revenue was generated outside of the United States (per page 80 of 180 of <a href=\"https://investor.paychex.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0000950170-25-095300/0000950170-25-095300.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paychex's 10-K Filing</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, it will be critical for U.S. economic growth to continue to hold strong. This is most especially the case for small and medium-sized businesses in the country, since that is the company's core focus. Any particular challenges to these clients (e.g., slowing economic growth or rising inflation) could put a damper on Paychex's growth potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk to the company is the scores of sensitive client data on its IT networks. If this is compromised in any way, impacted parties could bring litigation against Paychex. The company could also be hit with penalties by regulators. These events could cause an exodus of existing clients and make it more difficult for Paychex to attract new clients.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary: A Blue-Chip Deal Worth Buying Now</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Paychex checks many boxes for us. As the company further incorporates Paycor into its business mix, adjusted diluted EPS growth should be in the high single digits over the next few years. The market-beating payout is also adequately covered by earnings and free cash flow, signaling the potential for further dividend growth. Paychex's net leverage ratio is also vigorous.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Clinching our buy case is the fact that shares are priced 19% under our fair value estimate. If Paychex lives up to growth expectations and reverts to our fair value, the stock could have an attractive 27% upside over the next 13 months. Over the next five and a half years, Paychex could put up 13% annual total returns. In closing, that's why we're maintaining our buy rating.</p>",

And while the Dividend King is a strong business<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and great long-term holding, their valuation appears a bit stretched, making them less appealing.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock is in the green in the past year compared to peer PepsiCo (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP\" title=\"PepsiCo, Inc.\">PEP</a>), which is down double digits. This is led by underperformance in their North American segments. And while KO has navigated current economic challenges better so far, their valuation seems more to do with investors flocking to safety because of economic uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this article, I discuss KO's latest earnings, fundamentals, and why I suggest investors looking to buy to wait for a potential pullback.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Previous Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I last covered The Coca-Cola Company back in February in an article titled: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4761426-coca-cola-strong-momentum-bullish-but-headwind-keeps-me-from-upgrading\"><em>Strong Momentum Is Bullish, But One Headwind Keeps Me From Upgrading. </em></a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the beverage giant has since experienced some volatility, the share price has remained relatively flat over the past 8 months. It is down close to 2%. The S&amp;P (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" class=\"ticker-link\">SP500</a>) has continued its upward trajectory, up 15.41%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2049\" data-height=\"928\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"290\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">KO's headwinds that kept me at a hold were their valuation, macroeconomic uncertainty, and cash flow issues. Their cash flow was impacted by their tax litigation lawsuit with the IRS that required a $6 billion deposit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Free cash flow was down 51%, with dividends exceeding (FCF) of $4.7 billion, bringing the payout ratio above 100%. But I did expect the dividend to remain safe despite temporary headwinds. Limited upside to their 2026 price target of $68.56 also kept me cautious as I suggested investors wait for a pullback near $60.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong Earnings Delivery</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As mentioned earlier, the beverage giant delivered <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831463-the-coca-cola-company-ko-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">a strong Q3</a> and saw their share price rally as a result. EPS of $0.82 beat by $0.04, while revenue of $12.5 billion beat by $90 million, solid considering financially challenged consumers. Year-over-year, both grew 6% and 5%, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For comparison, PEP saw their bottom line decline slightly from $2.31 to $2.29, while revenue managed to increase modestly from $23.3 billion to $23.94 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PEP's performance in the past year has been impacted by performances in their North American segments. KO's performance was driven by a solid showing in their EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions, where they saw growth of 7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Bottling Investments, unit case volume grew 2%, up from the prior year's quarter, where it declined 31%. Activist investor Elliott Management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500105-eyes-on-pepsico-as-the-company-considers-a-refranchising-move\">recently took a $4 billion stake</a> in peer PEP, calling for the company to make strategic changes like KO with its bottling services, hoping to unlock value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far, the move by KO to battle declining volumes seems to have panned out. And Pepsi could soon follow in their footsteps. KO continued to grow market share for the 18th consecutive quarter, driven by their digital transformation efforts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During earnings, KO announced that in July, they sold a 40% stake in their Indian-owned bottler. This is expected to close sometime in 2026 and unlock growth opportunities in India and Africa. This is also another reason KO has outperformed PEP, as they seem to always be a few steps ahead.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margin Improvements</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Organic revenue growth was 6%, while global unit volume grew a modest 1%, up from a decline of 1% the year prior. However, organic revenue was lower than the previous year's 9%, a testament to the challenging economic backdrop. Margins also expanded as a result, with operating margins increasing from 30.7% to <strong>31.9%</strong>. Gross margins also expanded nearly 100 basis points from 60.7% to <strong>61.5%</strong>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1647\" data-height=\"1065\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"414\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>KO IP</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Free Cash Flow &amp; Guidance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a dividend-focused investor, I'm typically more concerned with a company's free cash flow even if they're Dividend Kings like KO and PEP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But in their recent quarter, cash flow improved to $2.4 billion, bringing this to $8.5 billion year-to-date, excluding the Fairlife payment. The previous year's quarter cash flows were impacted by the IRS litigation payment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a positive note, management raised FCF guidance, thanks to lower capital expenditures expected. Cash from operations is expected to amount to $12 billion, while FCF is expected to be $9.8 billion, up from $9.5 billion previously.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Organic revenue is still expected in a range of 5% to 6%, and EPS growth of 8%. Solid in comparison to Pepsi, who's expecting earnings to be flat from 2024's $8.16.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance Sheet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">KO's balance sheet was also in solid shape, with leverage well below their targeted range of 2.0x-2.5x at 1.8x. This, along with their A credit rating, gives the company flexibility should cash flows become impacted for any unforeseen reason, ensuring the dividend streak remains intact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1853\" data-height=\"801\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"277\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>KO IP</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Coca-Cola Company has rallied since September, up close to 7%.

PEP appears to be the better buy. Although, they've also rallied in the past month.

Moreover, with job losses increasing, this could lead to weakness within their segments, particularly in North America. And should volumes pull back, a sell-off is likely to follow.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While The Coca-Cola Company remains one of the safest businesses, I believe macro uncertainty has led to investors flocking to safe-haven investments like KO. This limits upside and could result in underwhelming returns going forward. Although I like KO's timeless brand, their valuation keeps me at a hold.</p>",

These are the two key points relevant to investors:</p> <ol> <li>Trump aimed to confirm the committed DFI<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> investments into the US and claimed he secured up to </span><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-visits-south-korea-he-attempts-secure-billions-investment?msockid=342659ca3eb068631bc54d2d3fcc69a2\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">$22 trillion in investments by the end of his first year in office</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> in his speech in South Korea. Obviously, the US economic growth would accelerate next year if these investments were realized, but also inflation would increase as well.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trump also met with the Chinese President Xi in South Korea, and they agreed to a broad 1-year truce, where part of the deal is a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/trump-cuts-fentanyl-tariffs-on-china-to-10percent-says-us-reached-rare-earths-deal-.html?msockid=342659ca3eb068631bc54d2d3fcc69a2\" rel=\"nofollow\">10% lower overall tariff</a> on imports from China, which reduces the overall inflation pressures, at least on margin. More importantly, a further tit-for-tat trade war escalation is now less likely, which reduces the overall macro uncertainty.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, on the surface, Trump's visit to East Asia has been successful, and the deals made are good for the US and the global economy - assuming that DFI commitments are actually realized and that the truce with China holds. However, there is considerable uncertainty whether these deals will hold.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The macro context</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trump's visit to East Asia was important within the geopolitical and the macroeconomic context.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Geopolitics</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From the geopolitical point of view, Trump's visit to East Asia was two-sided.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Trump met with the leaders of the key US geopolitical allies in the region, South Korea and Japan.</li> <li>However, Trump also met with the leader of the main geopolitical adversary, China, and narrowly avoided meeting the leader of another adversary, North Korea.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The State Department has a specific list of <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-15/subtitle-B/chapter-VII/subchapter-E/part-791/subpart-A/section-791.4\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"foreign adversaries\" 15 CFR 791.4: </a></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The People's Republic of China, including the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macau Special Administrative Region (China)</li> <li>Republic of Cuba (Cuba)</li> <li>Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran)</li> <li>Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea)</li> <li>Russian Federation (Russia) and</li> <li>Venezuelan politician Nicolás Maduro (Maduro Regime)</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On October 9th, China issued <a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/t0656_china_rare_earth_controls_2025_61_EN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">MOFCOM Notice No. 61.</a> in which it restricts the exports of rare earth materials for military use. Given that 1) China has nearly 90% control of global production and processing of rare earths, and 2) rare earths are essential in today's high-tech military equipment, China <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829908-us-china-trade-war-escalates-to-geopolitical-crisis\">escalated</a> the trade war to a major geopolitical situation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In response, Trump threatened an additional 100% tariff on China. It is also important to note that, just before the meeting with Xi, Trump announced that <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-appears-to-suggest-the-u-s-will-resume-testing-nuclear-weapons-for-first-time-in-30-years\" rel=\"nofollow\">the US will restart nuclear testing</a> on \"equal basis with Russia and China\".</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Economic growth</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trump's domestic economic plan is heavily dependent on foreign capital.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>First, tariffs are considered an important source of government revenue, used to offset the tax cuts in the Big Beautiful Bill.</li> <li>Second, Trump pledged to lower the reciprocal tariffs for the countries that commit to invest in the US - and this is expected to be the major source of growth from 2026 onwards.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, economically, for the US, it is important to formalize the committed foreign investments and to ensure their effective implementation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Deals with Japan and South Korea</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">South Korea pledged a $350 billion investment to get the reciprocal tariff on autos reduced from 25% to 15%, and that includes $200 billion in cash, paid in installments of up to $20 billion per year, and $150 billion directed toward the U.S. shipbuilding industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problem for South Korea is that $350 billion is 85% of its foreign exchange reserves. Thus, this investment will be very difficult and risky to implement. The US-South Korea deal does not specify how South Korea will raise funds to invest in the US. Thus, in my opinion, the actual implementation still remains uncertain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/10/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-brings-home-more-billion-dollar-deals-during-state-visit-to-the-republic-of-korea/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the list of all specific projects</a> agreed upon between the US and South Korea.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Japan pledged $550 billion to support U.S. industry and infrastructure and also to get the reciprocal tariff on autos reduced from 25% to 15%, out of which $332 billion is for critical energy infrastructure. Again, the problem is that such a large investment could strain the Japanese economy, since Japan would also commit public funds. No specifics were discussed in Japan about the source of funding for this DFI; thus, this investment also remains uncertain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/10/28195/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the list of all specific projects</a> agreed upon between the US and Japan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Trump's deals with Japan and South Korea specified DFI projects, but their actual implementation is still highly uncertain given that no information has been given about the source of DFI funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Separately, Trump signed the critical minerals agreement to 'further diversify the critical minerals supply chain' with Japan and the critical minerals access agreement with <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/10/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-secures-peace-and-prosperity-in-malaysia/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Malaysia</a>. This confirms the geopolitical aspect of the deals.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Deal with China</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China agreed to delay the implementation of the rare earth export ban for military use for one year - and that's the main outcome of the Trump-Xi meeting. Thus, the US now has a year to find alternative sources of rare earths, and it seems like the race is on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In return, Trump lowered the 20% fentanyl tariff down to 10%, which is not really a major concession. China also pledged to increase the purchases of soybeans, and both countries will start lowering trade barriers, such as port fees. Overall, these are minor concessions from both sides.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Market wanted to hear some positive news about Nvidia exports of Blackwell chips to China, but China seems to be on the path of self-reliance in high-tech, which supports the decoupling thesis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Implications</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Presidents Trump and Xi agreed to a temporary truce. However, the geopolitical situation remains tense, the US-Venezuela situation is escalating, the Russia-Ukraine war has no end in sight, and the fact that Trump invoked nuclear tests right before the meeting is also an escalation. Thus, there is uncertainty whether the truce will hold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The DFI investment is Trump's main plan for domestic growth, and tariffs are becoming an important part of government revenue. However, the Supreme Court will review the case in early November to decide whether the reciprocal tariffs are legal. If the Supreme Court upholds the lower court decision and rules against the Trump tariffs, the DFI pledges are unlikely to ever be implemented.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even if the Supreme Court rules in favor of tariffs, countries like Japan and South Korea will find it difficult to fully fund the pledged DFI. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty whether these DFI pledges will ever be fully implemented.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the Trump-Xi meeting and the deals with Japan and South Korea don't signal the return of globalization and free trade, which is what the market would want to hear.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global financial markets did not respond favorably to the outcome of the Trump-Xi meeting, with the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" class=\"ticker-link\">SP500</a>) falling by 1%, as the truce was already priced in. However, Gold (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLD\" title=\"SPDR® Gold Shares ETF\">GLD</a>) increased by almost 2%, which is the ultimate safe haven and, thus, the indicator of post-meeting uncertainty.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AUDC\" title=\"AudioCodes Ltd.\">AUDC</a></span>) in February of 2024, when we doubled down on our cautious stance (Hold rating) in the voice AI software-related Israeli company. Shares at the time looked like they were undergoing<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a bottoming pattern, as demonstrated by a crossover of the popular long-term MACD indicator just a few months previous. AUDC stock, as we see below, topped out in mid-2020, so it was tangible that buyers were finally stepping in, given the improved </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AUDC/valuation/metrics\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">valuation</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> on offer. Suffice it to say, although requiring more bullish evidence (primarily concerning growth rates, which would be revealed in earnings reports that followed), downside risk seemed limited in AUDC some 21 months ago.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, as we see below, AUDC stock failed to gain traction since then, with the stock actually losing approximately 17% in the process. From a technical standpoint, initially, it must be stated that the long-term death cross (crossing of the 10-month moving average beneath its 40-month average) in mid-2022 trumps any other technical indicator, including the long-term MACD. That moving-average death cross confirmed that AUDC entered a long-term bear market at that time. The opposing subsequent bullish MACD crossover can act as a precursor to a turnaround, but it should never be acted on solely, especially against the prevailing trend. Therefore, this is why, from an initial technical standpoint, we stood pat on our cautious stance 21 months ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"990\" data-height=\"1277\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AUDC Long-Term Technicals\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"826\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AUDC Long-Term Technical Chart (<span></span>StockCharts)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings Continue to Disappoint</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a fundamental standpoint, AudioCodes' quarterly earnings results have been disappointing, with the company missing EPS expectations in five out of the last six quarters. Although the company's second-quarter revenues ($61.08 million) this year beat the consensus, GAAP earnings were barely profitable ($0.01), missing the estimate by $0.06 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Irrespective of the rise in revenues, both compared to Q2 last year and Q1 this year, operating profit ($2.6 million) and GAAP profit ($0.3 million) both trailed their quarterly counterparts by some margin. This really is the issue with AUDC in that approximately $1 million in tariff-related costs hit the income statement in Q2, with up to $4 million expected to be the full-year tariff-related figure before all is said and done.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tariffs Exacerbating Profitability Headwinds</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Suffice it to say, irrespective of AUDC's attractive valuation, it looks like tariff-related costs are only going to exacerbate the company's poor profitability trends and forward-looking growth rates alike, most likely suppressing share-price appreciation in the process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is why investors should not solely focus on the likes of AUDC's growing services revenues ($32.6 million in Q2), which will keep growing recurring revenue streams over time. When it boils down to it, AUDC needs much better top-line growth rates because positive fundamentals in certain parts of AUDC's business continue to be drowned out by elevated tariff-related costs and muted growth, all things remaining equal.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Internal Growth Engines Not Showing Up in Overall Numbers</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, with annual guidance remaining on hold due to ongoing uncertainty, the 6%+ Q2 growth, for example, in the <a href=\"https://www.uctoday.com/ccaas/audiocodes-voca-cic-now-supports-microsoft-teams-phone-extensibility/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft Teams</a> business, is not enough, you feel, to change sentiment here. Furthermore, how much of the projected 40% growth in CX's <a href=\"https://www.stocktitan.net/news/AUDC/audio-codes-expands-voice-c-paa-s-offering-with-ai-vtqmyalnovkh.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Conversational AI</a> business next year will end up dropping to the bottom line? Moreover, whilst fresh certification approvals may open up connectivity with other platforms, how are we to gauge these developments when management fails to provide forward-looking annual visibility whilst growing its own controlled costs (SG&amp;A) in the process?</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses rose to $35 million, up from $32.5 million in the year-ago period. The higher expenses are primarily attributable to higher investments in marketing and sales resources as part of our conversational AI investment. As to the guidance, as mentioned in our previous quarter's discussion, we will postpone issuing a financial outlook until we have a better and clearer understanding of the resolution regarding tariff rates.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Expected Earnings Look Like More of the Same</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consensus for the third quarter (expected to be announced 11/4/2025) is expecting $0.01 in GAAP earnings on revenues of $60.8 million (1.2% expected growth). Again, we see here that these growth rates are not strong enough (GAAP earnings of $0.09 per share were reported in Q3 last year) when attempting to shift investor sentiment in earnest.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Discount Model</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, when we have a stock that is technically in a long-term bear market, has profitability headwinds, yet still pays a dividend, we like to run a dividend discount model to try and stamp an accurate valuation on the company. The formula we will use is the following</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-17618235258163922.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Dividend Discount Model Formula\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Dividend Discount Model (<span></span>WallStreetMojo)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">where EDPS is 'Expected Dividend Per Share.' CCE denotes 'Cost Of Equity,' and DGR refers to AudioCodes' 'Dividend Growth Rate'.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To initially calculate AudioCodes' DGR, we multiply the company's GAAP retention ratio (21.74%) by its return on equity (7.32%). DGR = 1.59%. Therefore, we can state that our EDPS equals the current annual dividend ($0.40) multiplied by 1.0159 = $0.41 per share</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To calculate AUDC's cost of equity, we use the formula below. Cost of equity is denoted as the rate of return investors require from a long investment in AUDC. We will use the current US 10-year treasury yield as our risk-free rate (4.06%), volatility instrument beta comes in at 0.96, and '<a href=\"https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Equity Risk Premium</a>' (4.33%) (denotes minimum expected return on a long investment in AUDC).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cost of equity = Risk-Free Rate + (Beta) x (Equity Risk Premium)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cost of equity = 4.06 + (0.96)(4.33) = 8.22%</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, the fact that COE comes in higher than ROE demonstrates that value is not being created for shareholders but actually being destroyed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plugging all of our numbers into the dividend discount model above, we get</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Value of AUDC = $0.41 / 0.0822 - 0.0159 = $6.18 per share.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, to sum up, based on AUDC's struggling profitability, lack of annual guidance from management, and dividend discount model result, we are downgrading our rating in AUDC to a 'Sell' until further notice. Many times, binary events such as quarterly earnings reports have the potential to change sentiment for the better, but constrained profitability trends point to us that all the risk remains to the downside. We look forward to continued coverage.</p>",

While I really like the company a lot, the current valuation is a bit discouraging. The company has been growing fast and has a lot more room to<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> grow, both on the top line and the bottom line. However, the problem is that to justify buying at the current valuation, it would need to grow above 20% CAGR for ten years, and it requires a pretty high net margin of 18% in the tenth year. While I believe the company could hit those numbers, it's a scenario that's tough to pull off.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Company Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hesai is a Chinese leader in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lidar </a>(Light Detection and Ranging) technology. To analyze the whole business, we can break down its operations into three main markets. First, in the automotive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_driver-assistance_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">ADAS</a> (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems). They supply major global Chinese OEMs, helping them create advanced cruise control and semi-autonomous driving. Second, they're the leading provider of Lidar sensors required for fully automated vehicles (<a href=\"https://www.sae.org/news/blog/sae-levels-driving-automation-clarity-refinements\" rel=\"nofollow\">level 4</a>) used in both robotaxis and roboshuttles. Third, they're developing and supplying robotic and industrial applications, including warehousing, logistics, and mapping.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the <a href=\"https://investor.hesaitech.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hesai-group-reports-second-quarter-2025-unaudited-financial\" rel=\"noopener\">last quarter</a>, the company reported triple-digit Y/Y shipment growth, showing an impressive change over the last year. Plus, it's starting to show profitability, which is another bullish indicator worth highlighting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"862\" data-height=\"213\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"hesai key metrics\" width=\"640\" height=\"158\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Key metrics <span>(Author's using company's fillings)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to <a href=\"https://www.hesaitech.com/lidar-industry-enters-mass-adoption-phase-hesai-remains-leader-in-global-market-share/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yole Group</a>, Hesai, despite maintaining dominance of the lidar automotive market, has dropped by 5% (500 basis points) between 2023 and 2024. It's important to note two aspects that create a lot of uncertainty regarding Hesai's market share and sales growth. First, the technological factor: any player could come up with a new technology and really threaten the sales and market share of everyone else. Second, given that ADAS and robotaxis are so sensitive, particularly due to the potential for hitting a pedestrian, the regulatory landscape is likely to shift rapidly in any direction. Therefore, we should be cautious when making sales and margin projections, especially when we consider the market share variations between Hesai and Huawei, as shown in the following chart.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://medias.yolegroup.com/uploads/2025/04/IMG-LIDAR-FOR-AUTOMOTIVE-2024-vs-2023-market-share_YG_Apr2025-1024x662.jpg\" alt=\"market share lidar hesai yole\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Yole Group</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the last few months clearly show a strong rebound. According to Gaishi Auto Research in August 2025, they held a 46% Automotive LiDAR <a href=\"https://www.itiger.com/news/1153102953\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">market share</a>, which is 1.5 times that of the second-ranked competitor and 2.4 times that of the third. The monthly installation volume has almost tripled since January, soaring from 33,485 units to 97,583 units. It's also worth noting that the bar is getting higher in the automotive industry; features once considered luxury are now becoming standard. For example, the Lidar sensors are now being called \"the invisible airbag.\"</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to <a href=\"https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-lidar-market\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mordor Intelligence</a>, the Lidar industry is expected to grow 18.85% until 2030. The main driver is the potential breakthrough of solid-state, less than $500 sensors for mid-tier models instead of premium ones, in other words, the potential acceleration of mass adoption of the LiDAR technology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In August, the company reported achieving a \"<a href=\"https://investor.hesaitech.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hesai-group-reports-second-quarter-2025-unaudited-financial\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">C-sample phase</a>\" for a top European OEM. In short, the \"A phase\" is about quick prototyping; the B phase focuses on functionality and final design. The C phase is about demonstrating the capability for high-volume quality required by the OEM. Then the D phase is the start of production. In other words, sales are going to be spiced up by expanding into Europe. Also, they announced a joint venture with Toyota based in China, with mass production beginning in 2026. In the domestic Chinese market, they led the creation of a \"<a href=\"https://www.codeofchina.com/standard/GBT45500-2025.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">standardization</a>\" of sensors, along with 50 other manufacturers, to accelerate the mass adoption of ADAS and lidar technologies. This has two advantages for Hesai: First, it could accelerate sales (through mass adoption), and second, it creates barriers to entry for small competitors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The robotics and \"physical AI\" segment can be framed as a call option, where the downside risk is somewhat limited to R&amp;D costs, but the upside has almost no ceiling given the vast range of potential applications ahead.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to valuation, it may be somewhat tricky for two reasons: First, the company is growing revenues fast at 38% TTM Y/Y in USD; and secondly, the margins are improving fast. In both cases, to approach valuation, it requires making assumptions in order to reach a figure and draw our conclusions about whether it is cheap, expensive, or fairly valued. Also, this is not done without a high level of uncertainty about the growth rate and the margin performance ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Revenues growth assumptions hesai\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"404\" height=\"501\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Revenues growth assumptions <span>(Author's)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here, the first three years are projected in line with the analyst consensus estimates. However, even after doing that, the rates are very optimistic. For example, when Mordor Intelligence expects an 18% CAGR in the next 5 years, the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSAI/earnings/estimates\">analyst consensus</a> implied rate is 37% CAGR between 2025 and 2030. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">((2230/452)^(1/5))-1 = 37.60%</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my case, I decided to go for a more conservative approach, using the native Excel function to forecast. It's still on the upper end of the optimistic forecast, but more realistic. To reach such a figure, I'm assuming the company will be able to do two things. First, it will maintain its current market share (in relative terms), but on a \"bigger market\" (growing in absolute terms), when mid-tier vehicles would adopt Lidar technology in bulk. Second, I assume the company will have some success developing and commercializing new robotic models for industrial applications, outside of the automotive segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The following valuation model is based on 4 key variables: revenue growth, net margin at the tenth year, a P/E representative of fair value for this company, and cost of equity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I already discussed potential revenue growth. Regarding net margin, it is the most uncertain part of this, especially looking at the 10 years ahead. However, I'm modeling not only to \"project,\" but also to \"<a href=\"https://www.wallstreetprep.com/knowledge/reverse-dcf-model/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reverse value</a>\" the company - in other words, how much it needs to reach in net margin terms to justify the current valuation. As we see in the sensitivity analysis, Hesai will have to grow at a CAGR rate of around the 20s, combined with reaching a net margin of at least 18% in the tenth year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1302\" data-height=\"457\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"hesai fair valued cheap expensive\" width=\"640\" height=\"225\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's assumptions</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding the P/E ratio, I just used 17x, which is the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSAI/valuation/metrics\">median</a> sector in SA. There are two sides here. The company may be significantly above the median discretionary sector because of its dominance and high level of innovation, but on the other hand, it is a Chinese company, which has additional risks compared to an American one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding the cost of equity, as I discussed in previous articles (especially in other Chinese companies, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4815623-qfin-holdings-poor-3q-2025-guidance-weakens-the-bullish-thesis\">such as</a> Qfin (QFIN)), I'm somewhat skeptical about the CAPM model. The Chinese <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/china/government-bond-yield\" rel=\"nofollow\">10y rate</a> now is at 1.75%; it doesn't make a lot of sense to discount to that rate, which translates into a measure of risk lower than an average US company. Instead, I used the US rate, so it resulted in something slightly above average, which I believe is more representative of Hesai.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While there are several risks to note, I will discuss the two I consider the most important: competition and political risks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to competition, despite their dominance in the market, there are other fierce competitors, such as Robosense (the main Chinese competitor), Luminar Technologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LAZR\" title=\"Luminar Technologies, Inc.\">LAZR</a>), Quanergy Systems (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QNGYQ\" title=\"Quanergy Systems, Inc.\">OTCPK:QNGYQ</a>), and Innoviz Technologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INVZ\" title=\"Innoviz Technologies Ltd.\">INVZ</a>). We should consider competition from three different perspectives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, Hesai's strategy is to lower prices in order to accelerate massive adoption; in that case, they would win not by a high margin but instead by high volume sold. However, the downside of this strategy is the potential price war that could erupt and really compress the company's profit margins. In a price war scenario, the companies with the most volume produced/sold will most likely survive, and the small ones will be hurt the most. So despite being somewhat bad, I believe it is not \"so bad\" for Hesai. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, they have a significant client concentration risk; losing only a few contracts/clients could show a substantial difference in total revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third, because we're dealing with a relatively new technology, there is a significant level of uncertainty. A competitor could find a way to develop a superior product—one with better value for money—and really challenge Hesai.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding political risks, there are two to highlight. First, the Pentagon <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/pentagon-removes-lidar-maker-hesai-us-list-firms-alleged-help-beijings-military-2024-10-16/\" rel=\"noopener\">re-included Hesai</a> on its list of Chinese military companies. After Hesai filed an appeal, a U.S. District Court <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/news/us-court-keeps-chinese-lidar-maker-hesai-on-pentagon-blacklist\" rel=\"nofollow\">upheld</a> the decision of the Pentagon. I believe the company will be fine as long as they avoid colluding with the Chinese military, of course. Given that case, the Pentagon, Europe, and others will be a ceiling in revenues for this company. I don't think Hesai's management has the incentives for doing that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, there was the risk of delisting Chinese stocks by the U.S. government. However, this risk has lowered over time. Regarding these two issues, the company has been primarily listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In other words, the company achieved a <a href=\"https://www.hesaitech.com/hesai-successfully-listed-on-the-main-board-of-the-hong-kong-stock-exchange/\" rel=\"nofollow\">double primary listing</a> condition, and, therefore, its stocks are fungible. This means that, in the event of a US delisting, investors can easily convert their US-listed shares to the fungible shares traded in Hong Kong.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the last months, things changed for good for Hesai. First, the delisting risk from the US government (which was somewhat small) has been further lowered by the double-primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Revenue in 2026 is highly likely to be spiced up by the European OEM, along with the joint venture with Toyota in China. Also, the potential in the robotics segment, while it's uncertain, is very appealing to me because the upside could be huge. From an <a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/management/ansoff-matrix/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Ansoff Matrix</a> point of view, this segment was a question mark, but if the trend continues, it appears that it will become the star segment. All this, of course, without taking anything away from the ADAS and robotaxis/roboshuttles segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding the risks, competition, the potential price war, and the political issues are somewhat manageable as of now. So, at first glance, it may not jeopardize the company. However, at the end of the day, the key metric for every company is forward earnings. From a reverse valuation point of view, the requirements of revenue growth and margins are pretty high at the current valuation. As for me, I'll wait on the sidelines for this great company; if there is a 20-30% drop in prices and no substantial change in the fundamentals, I will consider buying.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The company has been struggling to live up to its potential for years, posting<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> stagnant results, but shares still commanded premium valuation multiples in the meantime.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After a further fall earlier this year, shares traded at similar levels as January, yet valuations are still very demanding, even if the company returns to post historically high margins, all of which is making me very cautious.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">All About Machine Vision</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cognex has a mission to make advanced machine vision easy, which in itself is a hard thing to do. The company describes itself as the clear technology leader within advanced machine vision.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps this is best described by comparing the link between the human brain and eyes being applied to machines with optics taking the role of the brain and vision software the role of eyes. This allows machines to guide, identify, and inspect items in various industrial, logistics, and manufacturing environments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company employs about 3,000 workers, who generate just shy of a billion in revenues here, with the competitive positioning supported by nearly 1,500 patents issued and patents pending. In terms of geographical coverage, the business is extremely well diversified across the globe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Automotive is a key end market, with other markets including logistics, electronics, packaging, and, to a smaller extent, semiconductor applications as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the 2010s, the company more or less tripled sales, with revenues just surpassing the billion mark in 2021. Revenues have been stagnant in the years thereafter due to overinvestments during Covid, more challenging macro conditions (certainly within automotive), and perhaps some execution issues as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The boom and subsequent period of stagnation have been seen in the share price as well. A $10 stock in the early 2010s saw shares peak around the $90 mark in 2021, but ever since, shares have come down to the $40 mark at the start of the year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gauging Expectations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the end, 2023 turned out to be a very tough year, with sales down 17% to $837 million, with adjusted earnings reported at just $0.73 per share. Following the announcement of Japanese-based Moritex and a recovery amidst easy comparables, growth was returning in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The full-year results for 2024 were not yet known in January, but it was fair to say that adjusted earnings for the year were only seen around $0.75 per share, flattish compared to 2023. With net cash holdings down to just over a dollar per share, a $40 stock at the start of the year commanded very premium valuation multiples, around 50 times earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In February of this year, Cognex <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/773500753/files/doc_earnings/2024/q4/earnings-result/cognex-press-release-q4-24.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> a 9% increase in 2024 sales to $915 million, in between organic growth reported and the contribution of Moritex. So far the good news is that adjusted earnings only rose by a penny to $0.74 per share, with margins lagging here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company failed to issue a full-year guidance for 2025 but only provided a guidance for the first quarter, with sales seen between $200 and $220 million, as EBITDA margins were seen between 12% and 15% of sales.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2025: Mixed Times</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hurt by some currency headwinds, first-quarter sales <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/773500753/files/doc_earnings/2025/q1/earnings-result/cognex-press-release-q1-25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">rose</a> by just 2% to $216 million, although margins were much stronger, with adjusted earnings up five cents to $0.16 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second quarter sales <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/773500753/files/doc_earnings/2025/q2/earnings-result/cognex-press-release-q2-25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">were</a> up 4% to $249 million as adjusted earnings of $0.25 per share look solid but rose by just two pennies on the year before. Over the summer, the company <a href=\"https://investor.cognex.com/news/news-details/2025/Cognex-Announces-New-Leadership-Team-to-Drive-Strategic-Growth-and-Innovation/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> a new leadership team under new CEO Matt Moschner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the ambitions, the company saw mixed results as activist investor Engaged Capital <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4506284-cognex-gains-after-activst-engaged-capital-reports-stake\">reported</a> a stake in the business in the fall, citing potential for huge upside in the shares, believing that new management could boost margins by 1000 basis points over time, in line with previous performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By the end of October, Cognex <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/773500753/files/doc_earnings/2025/q3/earnings-result/cognex-press-release-q3-25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> an 18% increase in third-quarter sales to $277 million, yet the results benefited from a one-time contribution from a commercial partnership with a medical lab automation channel partner, with revenues otherwise up 13%. Adjusted earnings rose from twenty cents to $0.33 per share, or to $0.28 per share if we adjust for the commercial partnership.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Somewhat disappointing is that stronger momentum is set to slow down dramatically in the fourth quarter, which is surprising after the stronger momentum and new leadership being in place. Fourth quarter sales are seen between $230 and $245 million, suggesting a flattish to 7% increase in sales on an annual basis, with adjusted earnings of $0.19-$0.24 per share, largely in line with a $0.20 per share number reported in the final quarter of 2024.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Now?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares of Cognex fell from $47 to $40 upon the release of the results, with the fourth quarter outlook feeling a bit soft. Right now, realistic earnings are seen just shy of a dollar per share this year, a dramatic improvement from 2024 numbers, but still translating into demanding multiples around 40 times earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net cash holdings stand at $600 million, and with 170 million shares outstanding, net cash holdings stand around $3.50 per share. Down to the $40 mark, operating asset valuations stand at $36.50 per share, for a 37-38 times earnings multiple. Operating assets are here valued around $6.2 billion, and with sales seen close to a billion, sales multiples are seen around 6.5 times sales here. In part to undoubtedly please investors, the dividend was hiked by 6%, now payable at $0.32 per share each year, for a yield below a percent here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In between all this, Cognex has seen somewhat of a more resilient performance in 2025. While revenue and earnings growth is seen, and valuation multiples have come in, overall valuations remain very demanding. The risk-reward proposition still is not looking too favorable here despite long-term drivers in place related to labor shortages, inflation, and the need for automation, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At its peak, Cognex managed to post operating margins around 30% of sales. If that happens on a current one billion revenue base, after-tax earnings could come in around a quarter of a billion, equal to earnings around $1.50 per share.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even if this becomes a reality, it still is hard to justify the current valuations of the operating assets at a mid-twenty times earnings multiple. All this makes me continue to bark at current valuations, even if down over half from the highs in a post-pandemic environment.</p>",

Unfortunately, CoreWeave slumped following the deal agreement, in part due to taking on the debt of the data center projects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The deal has a fixed exchange ratio of 0.1235 shares of CoreWeave for each Core Scientific share. The shareholder vote is on October 30 and based on the current price, Core Scientific shareholders would only get $16.67 per share while the stock has already rallied to over $20 on speculation that the deal will get blocked.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CoreWeave has slumped from ~$160 prior to the deal to only $135 now.

CoreWeave added a $6.5 billion deal with OpenAI and a massive <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500180-coreweave-pops-amid-new-14b-deal-with-meta-for-ai-power\">$14.2 billion deal</a> with Meta Platforms, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), both of which indicate Core Scientific could land an expanded contract.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While approval of the deal could release CoreWeave to trade higher and provide more value to Core Scientific shareholders, the best solution is probably to just cancel the merger and let the stock prices adjust to market values. After all, both IREN and TeraWulf have tripled since July 7.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key investor takeaway is that the timing of the CoreWeave planned acquisition of Core Scientific didn't make a lot of sense. With CoreWeave facing a major lock-up expiration right after the deal announcement and the natural distraction from the major AI data center growth opportunity, the stocks haven't performed well during this period.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Core Scientific has already rallied into the shareholder vote on October 30, but the stock would appear to have more upside. Not to mention, the company appears past due for additional contracts that would juice the stock.</p>",
