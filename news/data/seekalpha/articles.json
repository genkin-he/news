Today we reiterate a Buy and check back in on the company's performance in the latest quarter and discuss the outlook. The company delivered another great report. Let us discuss the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557121-urban-outfitters-gaap-eps-of-1_05-misses-by-0_20-revenue-of-1_8b-beats-by-10m\">just-reported Q4 results</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue was a record for Q4. It grew 9.8% from last year's Q4 to $1.80 billion and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/URBN/earnings/estimates?hasComeFromMpArticle=true&amp;source=content_type%253Areact%257Csection%253Amain_content%257Cbutton%253Abody_link#figure_type=annual#hasComeFromMpArticle=true#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\">beat consensus</a> by $11 million. Now, the one thing that we really watch for with retailers is changes in comparable sales. This is a key metric for any retailer we analyze. It is almost more important than the overall sales figure, as it shows both traffic volume and pricing power. Comps are up across the board for Urban Outfitters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We saw comparable retail segment net sales increase a strong 5.5%. The increase was a result of mid-single-digit positive growth in both digital channel sales and retail store sales. Segment-wise, we saw comparable sales increase 9.6% at Urban Outfitters branded shops, increase 5.2% at Free People branded shops, and increase 3.7% at Anthropologie branded shops. This is solid performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One big driver of recurring revenue has been the subscription model that has been recently employed versus years past. Subscription segment sales jumped 42.6% from a year ago, thanks to a huge 40.3% increase in average active subscribers since last year. We will also point out that wholesale segment sales increased 9.1%. Much of that was from a 10.2% increase in Free People branded wholesale sales. Overall, this was incredibly positive across the board and drove the sales beat. What is even more impressive besides the mostly positive comps was that margin power improved.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margins and Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sales were up nicely, as we saw, but the profit margin is another key element we need to be aware of. Well, folks, gross margin was up a strong 101 basis points, so we saw expansion. Gross profit dollars increased 13.6% from last year, hitting $599.2 million, another record, and of course up nicely from the $527.7 million last year. We saw lower markdowns than a year ago and some leverage on delivery expenses thanks to combining customer packages. That is a win.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When we consider the operating expenses of $440 million, we saw a strong income from operations of $158.7 million, up from $125 million last year. Net income hit $96.3 million, and GAAP EPS was $1.05. Of course we look to the adjusted net income, and that was $130.5 million, and adjusted EPS surged to $1.43, up from $1.04 last year. This is a win. And yes, shares deserve to be higher when we look at the chart above, as annual EPS is expanding. Adjusted net income for the year came in at $499.2 million, with EPS of $5.44. Folks, this is up from $4.03, or up 35%. One could argue it was undervalued even into the print.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking Ahead</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we saw, it was a great quarter and an even better year, and shares were at $65 before the print; that was just 12X 2025 EPS. Can the growth continue in shares and in EPS? It is the EPS gains that will drive shares higher. We think the stock is pretty cheap right here, right now, and rate shares a Buy. Why?</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, there are 14.6 million common shares remaining under the repurchase program, which can further reduce the float. The company bought back 3.3 million of them this past fiscal year. But we see strength ahead as we suspect ongoing subscription increases and see sales improving once again in 2026. Based on the momentum, current inventory, and margins that we think will remain on par with 2025, we see the 2026 fiscal year seeing total sales of $6.60-$6.75 billion. That would be about 8% growth. Not counting any repurchase activity and factoring in a commensurate operating expense increase to sales ratio, we think you'll see EPS of $5.90-6.00. This implies shares trade at just 11X FWD. The company is also debt-free with a healthy liquidity position. Take advantage of weakness and do some buying.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACMR\" title=\"ACM Research, Inc.\">ACMR</a></span>) just reported quite a disastrous end to the year if you look at how the company’s shares reacted. I don’t think such a drop was justified, but the profitability declines are<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> quite worrisome, leading me to assign it a Hold rating for now.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the last time I covered the company back in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4722867-acm-research-stock-bright-future-ahead-china-sentiment-keeping-it-down\">September of 2024,</a> I said the company had a bright future and assigned a Buy rating. Since then, even with the current profit-taking action, the company’s share price is up over 220% vs. SPY’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>) 20.6%. That was a good call indeed, but given the uncertainty right now and quite the multiples expansion, I am not so interested in starting another position again.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>By the Numbers</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue for Q4 came in at around $244m, up 9.4% y/y, and beat estimates by around $3m.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s look at the breakdown of revenues in more detail. The cleaning segment still dominates with around 65% of total revenues for the quarter, which grew 3% y/y. The ECP, Furnace &amp; Other front-end grew almost 24% to $64m, and advanced packaging grew about 24% as well, to $20.5m. Shipments for the quarter came in at $228m, which is a decline of 13.5% y/y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48589448-1772140693512413_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1994\" data-height=\"952\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48589448-1772140693512413_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ACMR Investor Slides\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"306\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48589448-1772140693512413_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48589448-1772140693512413_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48589448-1772140693512413_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48589448-1772140693512413_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ACMR Investor Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the company’s margin profile, Q4 gross margins across the board took quite the beating. A decline of over 870bps to 40.9%. For the full year, margins came in at around 44.5%, which is still within the company’s long-term range of 42%-48%. It is quite a difference from the last time I covered the company, when we saw gross margins hovering close to 50%. The reason for such a drop? Nothing concrete except for a shift in the product mix, competition, and scaling costs. All quite vague. Operating margin also took a massive hit, going from 19.3% last year to around 12.1% this quarter, over 720bps deterioration. The operating expenses grew almost 21% while revenues only grew 9.4%. Adjusted operating income got hit even more, going from 25.6% to 15.9%, a massive 970bps hit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are substantial declines, yet the management is saying they are temporary, and they expect to see these recover as the company’s new products fully ramp up. It’s good that the company gave such a wide range in its long-term gross margin, hedging its underperformance. Because of these declines, the company’s Q4 Non-GAAP EPS came in at around 25 cents, which missed estimates by a whopping 15 cents.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s move on to the company’s financial position. ACMR finished <a href=\"https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828026011998?cik=1680062\" rel=\"nofollow\">the year</a> with around $757m in cash and equivalents, and around $400m in ST deposits and investments, against around $178m in long-term debt. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACMR/balance-sheet\">ACMR’s balance sheet</a> is very strong in my opinion. All of the debt, short-term and long-term, and long term is easily covered by the mountain of cash and ST investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of these results, the company reiterated its 2026 guidance as follows: revenue to be in the range of $1.08B to $1.175B or $1.1275B at the midpoint, which fell a little short of investors’ expectations of at least around $1.15B. These numbers imply a 20%-30% growth for the year, which is not too shabby at all. For the next quarter, revenues are expected to be around $228m vs $209m expectations and $0.34 in EPS vs $0.37 expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I’m not sure how to feel about this end of the year report. There are some positives, but clearly these positives have been overshadowed by the negatives, which is why the company’s share price plummeted over 18% as of writing this update. The massive EPS miss and rapid deterioration in profitability across the board did a number on its share price. Was it a catastrophic report that justified such a selloff? I don’t think so, but it wasn’t a pretty report, and when your share price has been steadily climbing for the last two years, anything but a perfect report will see some profit-taking action.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Comments on the Outlook</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After this report, it seems that the company will need to do a lot of work to restore investor confidence. It certainly needs to do a lot for me because the last time I covered it, I was giving it high praise due to its growth potential and profitability. Now, the profitability is a lot worse than before, which is much more important for me than the decent top-line guidance for 2026. So, what are they planning to do to restore margins?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They are banking on the company’s new products to deliver an improvement in the long-term, hopefully towards the higher end of the given margin range above, somewhere around 48%. Furnaces like PECVD, TRACK, ALD, and advanced cleaning tools like Tahoe and SPM, which have been proven to deliver 10%-15% better gross margins than semi-critical cleaners that the product mix shift towards them recently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, the company is planning to improve its supply chain to cut costs, which includes the Oregon facility expansion for localized production, as well as continuing its efforts to reduce China dependency, which was the big worry of many investors back in 2024 when I covered the company last. China still remains a large region for the company, but it is getting a lot more diversified than before.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What is interesting to see, and not at all surprising, is the product shift away from Foundry and logic, which still dominate, and much more towards memory and somewhat packaging &amp; wafer processing. We know what has been happening with high bandwidth memory (\"HBM\") and other memory players like Micron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU\" title=\"Micron Technology, Inc.\">MU</a>), Western Digital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WDC\" title=\"Western Digital Corporation\">WDC</a>), and SanDisk (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SNDK\" title=\"Sandisk Corporation\">SNDK</a>), which saw their share prices skyrocket in just one year due to supply and capacity shortages. Some of the clearly helped ACMR, as it does provide some tools for HBM and advanced packaging. This surge in demand shifted a lot of the revenue composition towards memory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48589448-17721406856047163_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"638\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48589448-17721406856047163_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ACMR Investor Slides\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"407\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48589448-17721406856047163_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48589448-17721406856047163_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48589448-17721406856047163_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48589448-17721406856047163_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ACMR Investor Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s Ultra ECP 3D product is in high demand due to HBM surging, so I expect to see some tailwinds here because these tools are essential for AI chip stacking.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, at least for H1 2026, the management expects to see lower margins persisting, and then gradually go back up once high-margin Track and PECVD revenues kick in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Should you invest in ACMR after the drop?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don’t remember when I sold my small position in favor of something else, but if I were to start again, I don’t think I would find it appealing right now, given how much its profitability deteriorated in just one year. Also, if you are already holding it for at least two years and saw over 200% gain on your position, I don’t think this should scare you one bit right now, so I would suggest holding through and maybe take some off the top and leave the rest to continue to ride the AI wave, as that is not ending for another couple of years.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will wait to see what happens over the next couple of quarters, and hope that its margins recover much faster than expected.</p>",

When I previously covered BTZ, I issued a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4822043-btz-cef-high-leverage-has-limited-nav-growth\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">hold rating</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> due to the limited growth potential attributed to the elevated interest rate environment and high use of leverage.

When including all distributions paid out to shareholders, the total return jumps up to 8.9% over the same time frame. BTZ now offers investors a starting dividend yield of 9.4% while issuing payouts on a monthly basis. The latest report indicates that the fund has generated sufficient income that supported distributions. While this is great for income investors, there are some trade-offs that should be considered.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3e380aee1f7837c48c298d7703cd38bd.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3e380aee1f7837c48c298d7703cd38bd.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3e380aee1f7837c48c298d7703cd38bd.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3e380aee1f7837c48c298d7703cd38bd.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For instance, the fund's allocation to credit instruments continues to be a source of stress in this high-interest-rate environment. Many of these income securities have an inverse relationship with high-interest rates, so growth is limited. Additionally, I believe the fund's net investment income needs to be substantially improved in order to improve the fund's resilience during market downturns. As it stands, the fund is heavily reliant on net realized gains to fuel its growth, which is challenging to capture during this current market environment. So let's start by taking a look at the underlying strategy that BTZ implements to generate its earnings.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Strategy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to the latest <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/240168/blackrock-credit-allocation-income-trust-usd-fund\" rel=\"nofollow\">fund overview</a>, BTZ has total managed assets of $1.55B that are spread across a diverse range of holdings. The fund has a listed expense ratio of 3.99%, which is extraordinarily high but a bit misleading. This includes fees related to interest expenses and operating costs related to some of its securities. Since BTZ is structured as a closed-end fund, BTZ is legally required to lump its expenses into its listed costs, but it isn't what investors actually pay. When excluding these other costs, the actual management fee sits at 0.96% of assets and is more reasonable considering the yield provided to investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund's primary objective is to generate a high current income for shareholders. It achieves this by allocating its assets across a variety of investment-grade credit, high-yield, non-US developed, and agency mortgage securities. Therefore, the fund essentially has no exposure to equities, and this means there should be no expectation for BTZ to stay on par with the movement of any indices. Many of its securities are directly linked to the health of the debt markets, so the fund is more likely to be influenced by interest rates rather than the movement of the indices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, the fund's share price continues to get suppressed by interest rates. The Fed initiated three separate <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4530232-fomc-cuts-interest-rate-for-third-straight-meeting\">25 basis point</a> cuts to interest rates in 2025, but the federal funds rate remains near the higher end of its ten-year range. Many of these debt-focused securities will typically share an inverse relationship with the federal funds rate, which means that valuations within BTZ's portfolio have struggled. As long as interest rates remain elevated, BTZ's growth potential may be limited. However, future interest rate cuts back to pre-pandemic levels may serve as a positive catalyst for growth in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_793942ef5c872fc36cd5e8249e38a130.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_793942ef5c872fc36cd5e8249e38a130.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_793942ef5c872fc36cd5e8249e38a130.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_793942ef5c872fc36cd5e8249e38a130.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expanding on the diversity of the fund, BTZ spreads its assets across different industries to help reduce concentration risks. As we can see below, BTZ is most heavily allocated to communications securities at 16.79% of assets. This is followed by an allocation to US agencies and consumer non-cyclical securities, which accounts for 12.51% and 12% of assets, respectively. The fund tries to focus on industries that are typically associated with reliable streams of income, which is why the allocation to technology securities makes up a smaller portion of assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720242772737727.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSU breakdown by industry\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"610\" height=\"524\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720242772737727.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720242772737727.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720242772737727.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>BlackRock</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BTZ is so large that its portfolio currently contains 1,771 different positions at this time. Despite the focus on income, BTZ's top holdings reveal a lot of notable names. Although Uniform MBS is currently the largest holding at 9.85% of assets, we can see many other traditional positions as well. For instance, this includes exposure to holdings like the Invesco Senior Loan ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BKLN\" title=\"Invesco Senior Loan ETF\">BKLN</a>), Verizon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ\" title=\"Verizon Communications Inc.\">VZ</a>), Bank of America (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC\" title=\"Bank of America Corporation\">BAC</a>), and Altria Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MO\" title=\"Altria Group, Inc.\">MO</a>), just to name a few. However, BTZ has exposure to these positions through various debt securities rather than common shares. Therefore, investors should not expect BTZ to keep up with the movement of its underlying holdings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772025283594226_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1242\" data-height=\"362\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772025283594226_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BTZ top ten holdings\" width=\"640\" height=\"187\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772025283594226_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772025283594226_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772025283594226_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772025283594226_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>BlackRock</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation &amp; Performance Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I previously covered BTZ, the fund traded at a small discount to NAV of 3.21%. Despite the minimal change in share price over the last quarter, BTZ now trades at a <a href=\"https://cefdata.com/funds/btz/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">discount to NAV</a> of 5.74%. For reference, BTZ has traded at an average discount to NAV of 5.97% over the last five years. Referring to the red line on the chart below, we can see that it appears like BTZ trades somewhere in the middle range of its price-to-NAV history. However, the data is skewed by the large decline experienced throughout 2022's market decline. When looking at the data from 2024, we can see that BTZ actually trades at a reasonable price to NAV level in relation to its recent range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721367006234782_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1083\" data-height=\"632\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721367006234782_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BTZ discount to NAV valuation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"373\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721367006234782_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721367006234782_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721367006234782_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721367006234782_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>CEF Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since my last coverage, BTZ has released an <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/resources/regulatory-documents/stream-document?stream=reg&amp;product=BTZ-AGG&amp;shareClass=NA&amp;documentId=2489228%7E1912821%7E1864346%7E1864322&amp;iframeUrlOverride=%2Fus%2Findividual%2Fliterature%2Fannual-report%2Far-retail-tax-book-one.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">updated annual report</a> for 2025. This is the only report that provides transparency into the fund's underlying earnings and NAV trajectory. Net investment income amounted to $0.71 per share, while net realized gains landed at $0.39 per share. Looking back on prior years, BTZ continues to produce net investment income within a consistent range. This can be an indication that the portfolio strategy and selected debt securities are efficient at generating income through different market cycles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the future, I would love to see net investment income support the annual distributions on its own. This approach is more likely to result in attractive price appreciation over time since the fund will no longer be reliant on net realized gains to fuel its NAV growth. As it stands right now, BTZ's reliance on net realized gains limits the overall NAV momentum of the fund. An improvement in net investment income would also improve BTZ's resilience through market declines by softening the rate of its share price erosion. For reference, here are the year-end NAV amounts over the last few years:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>2021: $15.10 per share</li> <li>2022: $11.19 per share</li> <li>2023: $11.59 per share</li> <li>2024: $11.27 per share</li> <li>2025: $11.36 per share</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720243425988672_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1675\" data-height=\"476\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720243425988672_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BTZ financial highlights\" width=\"640\" height=\"182\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720243425988672_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720243425988672_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720243425988672_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720243425988672_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>BTZ Annual Report</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current structure of paying out most of its earnings as a distribution means that the fund is incapable of providing price appreciation over time. Despite market indices racing to new all-time highs through 2025, we can see how BTZ's share price growth was nonexistent. Referring to the fund's performance over the last ten years, we can see that BTZ's share price has declined by 10.1%. When including all distributions that were paid out to shareholders, the total return jumps up to 96.5% over the same time frame. Therefore, investors should anticipate that most of their returns will come from the fund's ability to maintain a high rate of payouts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_0d80cc82a37e22a3a64506193ed947c6.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_0d80cc82a37e22a3a64506193ed947c6.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_0d80cc82a37e22a3a64506193ed947c6.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_0d80cc82a37e22a3a64506193ed947c6.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interestingly, this portfolio strategy and high yield isn't always enough to protect against market declines. For instance, market indices, such as the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>), have traded sideways over the last three months with the selloff of tech. Despite BTZ's high yield, the total return still underperforms against SPY over the same time frame. The issue is that BTZ may find itself in a scenario where it is paying out more than it generates, since net realized gains are a large part of the equation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_f873f0aa4e1fb064bdde62eb70aff774.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_f873f0aa4e1fb064bdde62eb70aff774.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_f873f0aa4e1fb064bdde62eb70aff774.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_f873f0aa4e1fb064bdde62eb70aff774.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Coverage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of the latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4536590-blackrock-credit-allocation-income-trust-declares-00839-dividend\">declared</a> monthly distribution of $0.0839 per share, the current dividend yield sits around 9.4%. Looking at the dividend history below, BTZ has maintained a consistent payout over the last five-year period. This is great for investors seeking a reliable source of dividend income within their portfolio, but there are some trade-offs. Referring back to the same annual report, BTZ has only been able to generate earnings that outpaced distributions twice in the last five years. While some of the challenges may be attributed to the market's uncertainty following the pandemic and changing interest rates, I believe this is an indication that something needs to change structurally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720243693557708_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1091\" data-height=\"400\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720243693557708_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSU dividend history\" width=\"640\" height=\"235\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720243693557708_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720243693557708_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720243693557708_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720243693557708_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that BTZ's long-term performance would be greatly improved if management chose to reduce payouts to match market conditions. By choosing to keep payouts the same, this keeps investors happy, but it also continues to threaten the fund's NAV over time. The fund offers a 9.4% yield, and if management were to reduce payouts by 20%, the dividend yield would still be around ~7.5%, which remains competitive amongst the high-yield landscape.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These changes would reduce the rate at which the share price declines and also display management's priority for preserving the NAV. A reduction would also translate to more capital appreciation during those periods where BTZ captures a high level of capital appreciation. The current strategy means that more NAV erosion is likely to occur in a scenario where interest rates remain at their current levels or increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, investors need to consider the risk that the distributions received from BTZ may not be completely tax-efficient. For reference, the latest <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/literature/press-release/1-30-26-pay-date.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Section 19(a) notice</a> indicates that 67% of the latest payout was supported by net investment income, which has the greatest tax consequence for investors. Therefore, a position in BTZ is best utilized within a tax-advantaged account for investors looking to minimize their overall tax liability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720341517145138_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1195\" data-height=\"518\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720341517145138_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BTZ distribution breakdown\" width=\"640\" height=\"277\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720341517145138_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720341517145138_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720341517145138_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720341517145138_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>BTZ Section 19(a) Notice</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In conclusion, I believe that BTZ remains as a hold at this time. Although the historical price-to-NAV graph is skewed by the deep discount experienced through 2022, BTZ actually trades at a reasonable valuation. Despite this, I still don't think it's a good time to accumulate shares since the growth potential remains limited in this high-interest-rate environment. The fund provides diversity across a wide range of income-producing securities, but the underlying structure is a bit flawed. For instance, the distribution policy is a bit generous at this time since the fund has frequently paid out more than it earned. This has historically resulted in NAV deterioration, which I would like to see resolved by a slight dividend reduction and an improvement in net investment income.</p>",

This follows a hugely successful M&amp;A and strategic repositioning roadmap in recent years.</p> <p>This strong operating and organic performance is<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to be applauded, yet the signaling of the business to issue equity to finance more deals, as well as demanding valuations, made me a bit cautious.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, as this too is somewhat of a derivative of the AI boom, shares have kept rallying later in 2025 and heading into 2026, backed up by continued strong achievements and continued operating momentum. While I continue to offer my praise to management, I fail to have the conviction to chase the shares here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">About the Transformation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having completed over a dozen M&amp;A deals over the past decade since its divestment from SPX Corp., SPX has turned itself into a focused and technology-enabled, but moreover, more profitable business after shedding a lumpy and low-margin power business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this is based on a valuation creation framework, which is based on a strong foundation, itself based on engineered niches, leading positions, moats, and sustainable operations. This is complemented by operational excellence and a solid capital allocation track record.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following this transition, the business reports its more than $2.2 billion revenue base across two major segments. The largest of these is a $1.5 billion HVAC business, one posting operating margins near a quarter of sales. This is complemented by a three-quarters of a billion detection and measurement segment, one posting fairly similar margins.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Massive Achievements</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has come a long way thanks to the aforementioned strategy, with revenues up some 50% over the past decade. The bigger achievement is that flattish operating profits a decade ago have risen to the mid-teens, even depressed by amortization charges, as otherwise margins come in closer to 20%. All this has been achieved amidst very modest dilution incurred, as praise goes to management in engineering this turnaround.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These advancements have been more than reflected in the share price, as it's good to understand the giant degree of momentum displayed by the shares. In fact, this was just a $10 stock a decade ago and traded in the $40s as recently as 2022. Ever since, massive momentum has pushed shares up to $243 at this moment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">About the Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While SPX Technologies has done absolutely everything all right, it has become a victim of investors applauding these achievements as well, granting the stock higher valuations with time passing. Following a 14% increase in 2024 sales to $1.98 billion, the company reported adjusted operating profits of $395 million, equal to $5.58 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Guiding for 2025 earnings to advance to $6.00-$6.25 per share, a $150 stock early in 2025 commanded a demanding multiple in the mid-twenties. The company announced several deals, however, including a $350 million deal to acquire Kranze Technology Solutions, as well as a $144 million deal for Sigma Heating and Cooling and Omega Heat Pump.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aided by these deals, the company hiked the full-year earnings to a midpoint of $6.50 per share over the summer, as organic growth was actually stuck in the low single digits. Trading near the $200 mark, the company offered 2.7 million shares in August to raise half a billion, reducing leverage after bolt-on deals were announced earlier that year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the high valuation, the dilution incurred from the equity issuance actually was accretive to earnings per share, making me still quite cautious. Trading at a high-twenty times earnings multiple, valuations were demanding, and while the company has a solid track record, organic growth was rather modest.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">More Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Supported by the financial room provided by the August equity issuance, the company announced two bolt-on deals over the fall. In December, SPX <a href=\"https://spx.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/spx-technologies-acquire-crawford-united\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://spx.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/spx-technologies-acquire-crawford-united\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> an agreement to acquire Crawford United, a highly engineered air handling and industrial products producer. Valued at $300 million, the transaction will contribute $82 million in sales and $23 million in operating profits, resulting in valuation multiples of 3.7 times sales and 13 times operating profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Early in the year, the company <a href=\"https://spx.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/spx-technologies-announces-acquisition-thermolec\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://spx.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/spx-technologies-announces-acquisition-thermolec\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the purchase of Thermolec in a $140 million deal. The Canadian-based business provides electric duct heating and related solutions, adding $35 million in annual sales, making the business valued at 4 times sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Driven by M&amp;A efforts early in 2025, the company announced a 14% increase in full-year sales to $2.27 billion, with EBITDA up 20% to $507 million, as adjusted earnings rose by 21% to $6.76 per share. Net debt was reported at just over $138 million, with pro forma net debt up to $578 million, for a leverage ratio just over 1 time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aided by the contribution of these two recent deals and organic growth, the company sees 2026 sales up around 13% to $2.535-$2.605 billion. Adjusted EBITDA is seen up to a midpoint of $605 million, with adjusted earnings reported up to $7.60-$8.00 per share. Part of this is driven by the continued rise of data center applications, this being a $200 million business in 2025, equal to about 9% of total sales, as discussed on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874204-spx-technologies-inc-spxc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874204-spx-technologies-inc-spxc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">conference call</a>. Data center revenues are seen up 50% in 2026, boosting the share in relation to total revenue to 12% of sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All of this is quite encouraging, as a share count of just over 50 million shares values equity at $12.3 billion here and the enterprise at $12.8 billion if we factor in current net debt levels. This values the business at around 5 times sales, just over 20 times EBITDA, and about 30-32 times forward earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are elevated, of course, in relation to the past valuation of SPX, the market at large, and also peers like Johnson Controls (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JCI\" title=\"Johnson Controls International plc\">JCI</a>) and Carrier (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CARR\" title=\"Carrier Global Corporation\">CARR</a>). Some of (these) peers, certainly with higher residential exposure, have been even suffering a bit, while margins are much lower in the lower teens.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Now?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Truth be told, I have been chasing shares of SPX for quite a while here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Time and time again, the company continues to perform, but time and <span>time again</span>, I bark at the high (forward) earnings multiples, often in the high twenties and now even the low-thirties! Of course, the company is playing a great trick by making solid acquisitions at reasonable prices, as it pays for these with retained earnings and some equity issuances at much higher valuations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The real achievement is that so many deals are made, yet strong organic growth is achieved, this standing at 7% and change in the fourth quarter of 2025, even accelerating from a full-year number at 6% and change for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This either implies great execution or great positioning, as we do not have to have a debate on whether organic growth stems from positioning or execution, as both are essentially to management's credit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, I likely see the roadmap continue, perhaps with some opportunities for equity raises during the year and more dealmaking, although I fear that it becomes ever harder to maintain organic growth while being so acquisitive. After all, buying is one thing, but integrating these businesses and delivering on organic growth is another.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, SPX and its management certainly deserve credit, yet keeping historical performances and expectations in mind, credit is given, but I fail to have the conviction to join for the ride. For appeal to be found, I'm happy to pay a premium.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A 22-24 times earnings multiple (or 4.0-4.5% earnings yield, at par to treasuries) translates into a desired entry point around $180 per share, provided that such a pullback has not been caused by deteriorating fundamentals.</p>",

This report is not a market prediction but describes a dystopic scenario that might take place in mid-2028. By then, AI<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> Agents can become extremely efficient, maybe too much, and this will be a significant concern for human intelligence. In such a scenario, most of the white-collar jobs that prioritize mental labor over physical labor are at risk, and of course, this has systemic consequences. White-collar jobs account for ~50% of the US workforce and ~75% of US consumption, a crucial component of the US GDP (~70%).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If they start to be replaced by cheaper AI Agents, consumption will drop as well as the GDP, and the stock market will follow suit. Citrini’s scenario points out a 10.20% unemployment rate by mid-2028 and an S&amp;P 500 Index down 38% from the October 2026 highs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, a very doomsday future that is scaring investors. However, how much importance should we give to this report? Does it have the potential to change our investment decisions? These are the questions that I am going to answer in this article.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">1) The SaaS Apocalypse Has Just Begun, but a Key Factor is Omitted</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to this report, the SaaS apocalypse has just begun. It started with the latest AI developments, such as the recent release of<a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-opus-4-6\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Claude Opus 4.6</a>.

And this is definitely not the most advanced version; there will be many more over the next years. Given these premises, are companies like Salesforce, FactSet, and Adobe at risk of being replaced?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An interesting point raised by Citrini is that AI Agents could have an impact on their operations even if the technology to totally replace them is not yet available:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>SaaS wasn’t “dead”. There was still a cost-benefit-analysis to running and supporting in-house builds. But in-house was an option, and that factored into pricing negotiations. Perhaps more importantly, the competitive landscape had changed.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, just the fact that in 2026 you can think about in-house builds (even though it might not be the best option for you), you could use it as a negotiation lever. So, if the salesperson expects you to pay a 5% increase for your subscription plan as you have always accepted over the last years, this time you can fight back.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>The salesperson had expected to run the same playbook as last year: a 5% annual price increase, the standard “your team depends on us” pitch. The procurement manager told him he’d been in conversations with OpenAI about having their “forward deployed engineers” use AI tools to replace the vendor entirely. They renewed at a 30% discount.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding this aspect, I believe Citrini got the point of the situation. The “SaaS apocalypse” should not be considered as a revolution that will destroy every SaaS company but as a key turning point for this industry. Nobody questions that Salesforce will still be the #1 CRM in 2028, but the doubts concern its business model and pricing power. With these new AI Agents on the market, will Salesforce (and all the other SaaS companies) be able to increase the price of its subscriptions? That’s hard to say, but what we do know is that it can’t escape a period of change.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the current state, Salesforce is forced to invest aggressively in AI unless it wants to lose the lead, but this forced decision is a bitter medicine.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>The companies most threatened by AI became AI’s most aggressive adopters.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Salesforce is implementing AI Agents within its platform to keep up with the times, but there is a high risk that they might cannibalize its own revenue streams. Salesforce and many other SaaS companies base their business models on selling subscriptions to users, something that currently goes against the primary role of AI. AI Agents are supposed to provide you the same or better outcome with fewer users, and this means less revenue from subscriptions. Things change if your business is intended to solve problems regardless of the number of users (pay-per-outcome). In that case, AI is an enhancer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SaaS companies might be forced to rethink their business model from pay-per-user to pay-per-outcome, but this transition might take years, and we don’t yet know the economic consequences. There is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding these companies, and this explains why they have become falling knives. As I<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871702-saas-apocalypse-the-law-of-the-strongest-crushing-the-weak\"> expressed in a recent article</a>, due to the complexity of the situation, I am staying out of these companies even though they seem very cheap. However, today I want to speak up for them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Citrini report adds further fuel to the fire, but it never takes into account the elephant in the room: who is really going to replace all the SaaS companies? Sure, AI Agents, but belonging to which companies exactly? Anthropic and OpenAI are worth <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/anthropic-hits-380b-valuation-heightens-224521453.html\" rel=\"noopener\">$380 billion</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-19/openai-nears-100-billion-funding-at-850-billion-valuation\" rel=\"nofollow\">$850 billion</a>, respectively, but neither of them makes a single dollar of profit (it will take years to become profitable). They need constant funding as they are cash-burning machines, which is why an IPO is expected for both of them in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market is doubting the SaaS companies’ business model, but nobody is questioning whether Anthropic and OpenAI will face some headwinds to turn profitable. That’s not a small detail: no business is good enough if it doesn’t make money. At least, current SaaS companies still have huge profit margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I believe the first part of the Citrini report is quite interesting and thought-provoking, but it has a major flaw never brought up: innovation is nothing without profit. Believing that Anthropic and OpenAI (or whatever AI company is on the rise) will replace many established SaaS companies while still remaining widely unprofitable is something that is very unlikely. Once these companies go public, investors won’t accept constant dilutions; they will demand some profits, and not over the next decade. Meanwhile, Salesforce just reported the quarterly results, and it keeps growing double digits, on top of announcing a $50 billion buyback program.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2) No More Friction, but I Have Many Doubts About It</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is probably the most controversial part of the whole report. Citrini depicts a scenario in which friction is going to 0 since the network effect competitive advantage has been destroyed by AI Agents. Most of the companies that used to collect small fees on services provided to millions and millions of people are at high risk. How is it possible? Well, AI Agents are expected to change the way people buy things.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An AI Agent always picks the best economic choice for you; that’s the core behind this idea. Therefore, all the industries that exploit this kind of moat will see their profit margin heading to 0%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the future, if you want to buy something, you don’t need to look for it on Amazon; the AI Agent will do it for you at the best price by instantaneously comparing all the prices on each e-commerce platform. The same reasoning also applies to other cases:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>If you want to book a trip, you no longer need Booking. The AI Agent will automatically buy for you the cheapest trip package (flight, hotel, experiences) by instantaneously confronting all the available options.</li> <li>If you need a ride or food, Uber becomes obsolete. The AI Agent doesn’t take into account Uber’s network; it only cares about the cheapest option for you. So, if new companies join the industry and accept lower fees, they will eat up Uber’s market share.</li> <li>Visa, Mastercard, and American Express are going to be hit hard. AI Agents hate friction and paying fees; therefore, every transaction will be settled with stablecoins via Solana or Ethereum L2s. In this way, a merchant receives $99.99 out of a $100 payment vs. $97.50 in a traditional transaction.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, giants like Visa, Booking, and Uber will soon lose their moat to the point of becoming worthless. Personally, I couldn’t disagree more; in fact, I have recently bought shares of all these companies. As for the previous paragraph, in this one as well, there is a huge missing point that this scenario never takes into account: these companies are not charging fees for no reason; they are offering an essential service. Let’s start with Visa.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">You need a new pair of shoes, and since we are in 2028, you ask your AI Agent to buy a specific model at the lowest price. So, the AI Agent compares all the websites, finds the model you were looking for, and pays with stablecoins via Solana. Two days pass, and nothing arrives at your home. Great, you have been scammed, and since you didn’t settle the transaction via the Visa network, you can’t call your bank and get your money back. Furthermore, stablecoin transactions don’t have the same strict regulations in terms of money laundering, the network might go down more frequently than Visa's, and you have to say goodbye to your cashback. In fact, Visa is a credit network; with stablecoins, you can spend only what you own.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In that small fee, Visa does all these services that are crucial to protect both the consumer and the merchants. The Solana network might be cheaper, but I believe that nobody would ever take it seriously. Even though not visible in the balance sheet, trust is the most valuable asset, and Visa has plenty of it. The same logic applies for Booking and Uber.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">You want to take a vacation after a whole year of hard work, and you totally rely on your AI Agent to book a nice one. The AI Agent finds a great place for a low price, but you get there, and the hotel doesn’t have your reservation. Great, once again you have been scammed, and you can’t complain to anybody; the AI Agent doesn’t take responsibility for its actions. In case of a Booking reservation that didn’t go as planned, you can call customer service, and in the worst case, they will find you a new place to stay.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trust is also Uber’s biggest advantage. Would you ever trust booking a ride through your AI Agent? The AI Agent only cares about finding the cheapest ride; it doesn’t care if you disappear in the middle of the night. Every Uber ride is tracked by a real-time GPS, every rider has auto insurance, and in case of an incident, you get immediate help.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I find the second part of the Citrini report totally out of touch, as if the best companies in the world can be easily replaced by a cheaper (and not better at all) option. Their moat is decades long, and they know well in advance if a new trend is emerging. Visa has been investing in stablecoin transactions since 2021, Booking is already implementing AI in its platform, and Uber won’t be replaced by an Agent that doesn’t understand what the real priorities are.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3) Innovation = Regression. But Isn't That Always the Case at the Beginning?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the final part of the report, Citrini highlights the economic/financial consequences of such a dystopic scenario. Like dominoes, the white-collar's replacement by AI Agents triggers a downward spiral in consumption. It is not just a matter of losing the job and not having the same spending capacity, but it is also a matter of not being able to face previous expenses. In fact, those people were used to relying on high wages, and with a high FICO score, their access to credit was smooth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, once they get fired, they are forced to accept lower-wage jobs, even freelance jobs (Uber drivers, Fiverr…). And that’s a huge problem, not only for them but also for banks. They issued a significant amount of mortgages to white collars, but their creditworthiness is no longer the same, so banks are forced to increase allowances for credit losses—therefore their profits collapse. Mortgages that previously were considered safe are now very risky (does this ring a bell?), and this is how the systemic risk spreads across the globe. In all this, companies generate less profit; therefore, they replace the remaining white collars with AI Agents in order to reduce costs, adding further fuel to the downward spiral.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The potential crisis described in this scenario is something new for humanity; in fact, there isn’t a clear solution:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>This is the first time in history the most productive asset in the economy has produced fewer, not more, jobs. Nobody’s framework fits, because none were designed for a world where the scarce input became abundant. So we have to make new frameworks. Whether we build them in time is the only question that matters.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2000, 2008, and 2020, you could lower interest rates and inject liquidity into the system in order to sustain the economy, but what can you do if the problem is the human intelligence itself? You can’t force companies to hire people, and if they find it convenient to use AI Agents, they certainly will. They don’t care if rates are at 0%; they won’t hire you if an AI Agent costs a fraction of a human employee. What a complex situation, right?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At first glance it seems that there is no solution, but this is completely normal; we are humans, and our forecasting ability is terrible. We can’t comprehend what is coming next, and this makes us anxious. We know that AI will change our daily lives forever, but we don’t know in which way; major changes always come with a lot of doubts; there is no exception. That’s why the Citrini report got such a large following and exacerbated the losses of all those companies involved in this historical shift.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Uncertainty creates doubts, and doubts create panic. But what if I tell you that every major change goes through the same process? In 1995, the economist<a href=\"https://www.consulttci.com/Book_reviews/endwork.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Jeremy Rifkin</a> published a book titled “The End Of Work - The Decline Of The Global Labor Force And The Dawn Of The Post-Market Era.”</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>We are entering a new age of global markets and automated production. The road to a near-workerless economy is within sight. Whether that road leads to a safe haven or a terrible abyss will depend on how well civilization prepares for the post-market era that will follow on the heels of the Third Industrial Revolution. The end of work could spell a death sentence for civilization as we have come to know it. The end of work could also signal the beginning of a great social transformation, a rebirth of the human spirit. The future lies in our hands.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding a significant innovation, you will always find catastrophic theses along the way. As you can see, the concept of a “workerless economy” is definitely not something new, and it gets hyped every time society faces an important shift. I am not accusing Jeremy Rifkin of having been short-sighted; he simply couldn’t know what was about to come. Back in 1995, nobody could have predicted Amazon’s rise, people making millions by recording themselves (Meta and Alphabet were not even born), or a streaming platform with 350 million users (nobody believed in Netflix in its early days).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Do you think it was any different before the widespread adoption of computers? Not at all.<a href=\"https://assets.press.princeton.edu/chapters/s7704.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"> On March 22, 1964</a>, President Lyndon Johnson ended up reading a fourteen-page memorandum (some of the writers were Nobel Prize winners). That was the content:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>A new era of production has begun. Its principles of organization are as different from those of the industrial era as those of the industrial era were different from the agricultural. The cybernation </em><em>revolution has been brought about by the combination of the computer and the automated self-regulating machine. This results in a system of almost unlimited productive capacity which requires progressively less human labor. Cybernation is already reorganizing the economic and social system to meet its own needs.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Once again, the society was scared about less human labor in the future. I can go even further back in time, and the result would always be the same: every innovation seems to be the one that will make human labor obsolete, but in hindsight it is never that way.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nowadays we are living in that moment (the last time was in the late 90s), and it is very easy to be influenced by catastrophic theses. I don’t know what the future looks like, but history tells me that it won’t be so dark as portrayed. Of course, a recession will come sooner or later, but that’s part of the business cycle, and it is a solvable problem, nothing to do with permanent job losses. A lot of people will definitely lose their jobs, but others will reinvent themselves or will be engaged in jobs that we cannot imagine today.</p>",

At the time, revenue growth was strong, charge-offs were improving, and margins were also expanding. But valuations were not compelling enough to compensate<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> for the rising macro credit risks and uncertainties. I was concerned about the earnings durability in a potentially weakening consumer environment. I was also wary of a very competitive subprime lending segment and limited expansion potential. Since then, my wait for a better visibility of the credit cycle and a deeper valuation reset have both played out favorably to consider a Buy. All this while, operating strength remained intact.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Execution and Operating Strength</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interest and dividend income growth has strengthened from ~10% levels we were seeing in May last year. There is visible growth acceleration and further confirmation of a growth trend that had just emerged in Q1 2025. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834849-oppfi-inc-opfi-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q3 2025</a> also reported a ~41% YoY increase in adjusted net income. Guidance for revenue growth is solid (double digits) in Q4 and into 2026. Adjusted net income has also been guided significantly higher from $125-130m earlier to $137-$142m for the full year. That is a material revision for the full year with just a quarter left to report, although the YTD run rate was already pointing to ~$150m. This guidance upgrade could be interpreted as conservative expectation setting and upgraded with only better visibility and certainty – but even that better visibility and certainty counts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/62089123-17719004168890316_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"750\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/62089123-17719004168890316_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Interest and Dividend Income Growth YoY - OPFI\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/62089123-17719004168890316_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/62089123-17719004168890316_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/62089123-17719004168890316_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/62089123-17719004168890316_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Interest and Dividend Income Growth YoY - OPFI <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Conducive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since my May thesis, OppFi has corrected by ~24%, but valuations have contracted much more. With earnings revised upward, the forward P/E ratio, which was around 9x earlier, is now ~5x (far lower than the ~7x levels I had in mind to re-evaluate entries). At ~5x, markets are either discounting an earnings contraction phase ahead or are skeptical about earnings sustainability – OppFi's double-digit growth and repeated earnings guidance upgrades do not explain this sharp a multiple contraction. Even if earnings fall by ~30%, the P/E ratio expands to ~7-8x – levels I had found reasonable for a profitable specialty lender in 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_22d735ad133db81c969b5316e3569c5b.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_22d735ad133db81c969b5316e3569c5b.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_22d735ad133db81c969b5316e3569c5b.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_22d735ad133db81c969b5316e3569c5b.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPFI/valuation/metrics\">price-to-book ratio</a> is ~2.96x. This may look higher than traditional lenders who generally report valuations at around 1-2x the book value (median valuations ~1.2x). Specialty lending could be priced higher if the RoE and book value are expanding strongly. And in OppFi's case, both are visible. The book value dipped a bit before rising materially above the ~$30m mark seen in Q1 2025 (which was the basis of the May 2025 thesis). The RoE has also followed a similar expansion path and now sits at a very strong ~51% level. With ~$140m in projected earnings against $277m in equity, retained earnings should expand book value rapidly, compressing price-to-book valuations organically if profitability holds. Overall, at ~5x earnings and ~3x book with ~50% RoE, valuation now provides asymmetry – provided credit metrics remain within management’s targeted bands.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_ebcda6f4eb8f3e398403874270bbea4f.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_ebcda6f4eb8f3e398403874270bbea4f.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_ebcda6f4eb8f3e398403874270bbea4f.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_ebcda6f4eb8f3e398403874270bbea4f.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_627bcd08044de5fdc50e87f9645d1725.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_627bcd08044de5fdc50e87f9645d1725.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_627bcd08044de5fdc50e87f9645d1725.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_627bcd08044de5fdc50e87f9645d1725.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Credit - The Core Variable</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Credit becomes the core variable for OppFi as it scales. While the macro-related credit risks I was wary of in May last year have not emerged, the macro uncertainty has not improved significantly either. The odds of a recession <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/outlook/market-outlook\" rel=\"nofollow\">still loom</a>, and credit deterioration cannot yet be ruled out – unless growth stabilizes, labor markets strengthen, and we have better clarity on monetary policy. However, we have lived through a tariff regime and its uncertainties without collapsing, and the odds of a recession, although still high, are decreasing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Importantly, OppFi's credit quality is not showing any obvious signs of worsening. Net charge-offs are now 35% of revenue, only marginally higher than the 34% level seen last year. OppFi now has the capability to dynamically adjust pricing across risk bands, including adjustments at the weekly level. This means when losses rise, yields can adjust. Additionally, management has demonstrated a sustained strong recovery record for the past two years. Lower fixed costs also help cushion any rising loss scenario in a softer credit phase. OppFi's operating expenses fell to ~30% of revenue in Q3 2025, compared to 33% in the prior year. Interest expenses also fell to 6% of revenue (vs. 8% earlier).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The execution so far, overall, improves confidence in OppFi's ability to navigate a slightly deteriorating credit situation. And all is not well in terms of the credit environment – new vintages showing higher early payment defaults. Management has acknowledged a potentially worsening credit situation, but nothing that alters OppFi's ability to navigate it:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>I'm not going to not say that credit isn't worse. It is worse than it was last year in the new segments, especially the new, but something that we can operate in now with our current pricing structure and how we operate.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The numbers so far do not show material impact overall. These are not the best credit conditions, but the impact appears to be controlled – offset by recoveries and cushioned by lower funding costs. The provisions data charted below (as a % of revenue) also shows controlled loss intensity relative to earnings power. In the past few quarters, the provision ratio has also stabilized within the 32-38% band, despite modest credit softening in newer vintages. Overall, credit costs are elevated but within a controllable band.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62089123-17719178654924443_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"750\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62089123-17719178654924443_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Provision as a % of Revenue - OPFI\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62089123-17719178654924443_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62089123-17719178654924443_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62089123-17719178654924443_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62089123-17719178654924443_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Provision as a % of Revenue - OPFI <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">OppFi Is a Buy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I expect OppFi to continue its double-digit growth not only in the upcoming quarter but also in early 2026 as well. I think markets are cautious about OppFi now because of higher charge-offs in Q4, as indicated in the Q3 earnings call. I think that could be the case indeed (charge-offs drifting to the higher thirties), but that is not a structural issue or a reflection of macro worsening. Q4 may see higher charge-offs due to seasonal effects like seasoning and delinquency roll-forward mechanics and holiday spending stretching borrower liquidity. We have seen higher provisioning in Q4 2024 too. I would take the opportunity to Buy before the quarterly results, while the expectations are low (because there is no structural damage here yet).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My Buy call is comforted by valuations that are much more conducive and often absorbs bad news, especially if temporary. I have argued before how the valuations can absorb short-term earnings shocks at current levels and still look reasonable if the long-term thesis holds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q4, alongside an expected worse charge-off, I see adjusted net income coming out well over the guided $137-$142m range. This is because the current run rate, even with deep moderation (say 25%), shows an adjusted net income above the upper end of the full-year guidance (~$142.5m). That could compensate for any negative sentiment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The primary risk to the Buy thesis is if credit normalization does not stabilize as expected, although nothing negative is indicated yet. A sharper deterioration in borrower metrics, particularly if newer vintages show sustained weakness beyond seasonal patterns, could push charge-offs above manageable bands and pressure earnings despite pricing flexibility. Investors should also watch whether competitive intensity or regulatory developments limit OppFi’s ability to fully reprice risk. If loss trends accelerate, the earnings durability narrative would weaken, and the multiple may remain compressed longer than anticipated.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, the thesis rests on three pillars – accelerating operating momentum, materially improved valuation, and credit costs that remain controlled (even if it stays at current levels). I maintain a Buy as long as charge-offs and provisions stay within historically manageable ranges and earnings power remains intact. I would reassess this position if net charge-offs move sustainably above 40% of revenue without offsetting pricing power, or if guidance turns structurally lower due to credit stress rather than seasonality.</p>",

Part of this is because many major market indexes have been stuck in a trading range and seem to have hit stall speed for<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the past few months. I see so much uncertainty in various areas now, which I think is making it hard for the stock market to break out of its recent trading range. Like most investors, I see reasons to be both bullish and bearish.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, if the market is unable to resume climbing a \"wall of worry\" soon, I think the chances of a market plunge will become more likely. I think many market participants hoped that a strong earnings report from Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) would reignite the bull market, but the stock's post-earnings price action seems to be a potential warning sign for the market overall. This downbeat reaction seems to cap the results of the earnings season overall—despite strong earnings reports in general, the stock market has been unable to rally on this good news. With all this in mind, let's take a closer look at what could get the stock market back on track:</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Charts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the chart below shows, the S&amp;P 500 Index (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a></span>) has been stuck in a trading range for a few months now. While this index is still trading near record levels and near the 50-day moving average, I believe it risks a correction, as it appears to have run out of steam. If there is a drawdown, it might not be too bad, as it could find support near the 200-day moving average, indicated by the red trend line on the chart. A pullback to this level would represent a decline of about 7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721310783125591_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"990\" data-height=\"817\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721310783125591_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"528\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721310783125591_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721310783125591_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721310783125591_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721310783125591_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>StockCharts.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The S&amp;P 500 Index has held up relatively well because it is a broader index with a significant number of stocks outside the tech sector. Many investors are rotating out of tech stocks due to fears about an AI bubble, overspending on capex, and AI disruption in software and other sectors, and this has helped to support this broader index. As shown in the chart below, the NASDAQ 100 Index (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NDX\" title=\"NASDAQ 100-Index\">NDX</a></span>) appears to have formed a bearish double top on the chart since hitting record highs in October and then roughly matching those levels in January before pulling back to current levels. The failure to decisively break out to new highs in January is a potential warning sign for the bulls.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311118424625_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"990\" data-height=\"817\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311118424625_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"528\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311118424625_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311118424625_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311118424625_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311118424625_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>StockCharts.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings Season Has Failed As An Upside Catalyst</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Many companies reported strong earnings overall, and earnings season is wrapping up now. The hyperscalers reported strong earnings results, but their stocks fell after they announced plans to increase capex spending. Nvidia was one of the last major tech stocks expected to report earnings. Nvidia reported very strong earnings, which was widely expected, but the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557921-nasdaq-drops-nearly-2-percent-as-the-tech-selloff-deepens-post-nvidias-earnings\">post-earnings price action</a> was negative, and that suggests that Nvidia can't carry the market higher for now. With earnings season largely over and the major market indexes still stuck in a trading range, the bulls will need to find new potential upside catalysts soon. If they don't, I believe the market is likely to resolve the position it has been stuck in by declining.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here Are Some Potential Upside Catalysts That Bulls Can Focus On</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Potential upside catalysts include lower interest rates as we move further into 2026 and potentially large tax refunds for many households. However, just as great earnings were expected and delivered by Nvidia, I think that investors may have already priced in the expectations for lower interest rates and larger tax refunds. This could mean these are non-events, just as Nvidia's strong earnings report was a non-event instead of a major upside catalyst for the bulls. So, it might take a combination of positives to get this bull market back on track, and it might also need more potential upside catalysts, which could include the following:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>1) AI Disruption Fears Could Ease:</strong> The software sector has been one of the hardest hit by fears of AI disruption, but many sectors have been impacted by these fears recently. It is starting to look like these fears are getting out of hand. One potential example is a former karaoke company that recently <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/pro/tens-of-billions-of-dollars-wiped-out-from-household-name-brands-as-obscure-penny-stock-karaoke-vendor-turned-ai-platform-debuts-game-changing-platform\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> it was changing its focus to AI and that it had a game-changing development in freight logistics using AI. When this announcement was made a few days ago, the market responded by wiping out over $17 billion in market cap in the freight sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think this is a clear sign that investors are potentially overreacting, so if investors realize that the worst fears over AI disruption might not be very likely, the tech sector, software in particular, could be poised for a rebound. A rebound in software-related stocks like Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) could be the upside catalyst that this market needs for the bulls to take back control. If you look at the chart of the software sector below, you can see that these stocks recently reached the same lows hit during the stock market plunge after Liberation Day tariffs were announced in April 2025. This suggests that this sector may have bottomed out and could be poised for a relief rally, which could benefit the stock market overall.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311483905313_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"990\" data-height=\"817\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311483905313_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"528\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311483905313_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311483905313_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311483905313_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311483905313_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>StockCharts.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>2) IPO Success:</strong> OpenAI and Anthropic are two of the most revered AI startups, and both plan to go public in 2026. If these companies and other high-profile tech companies have successful IPOs, it could alleviate concerns about funding and circular deals that have created fears of an AI bubble. OpenAI in particular seems controversial because its major commitments will require massive funding. However, if they raise more cash in an IPO with an estimated <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/openai-is-reportedly-planning-a-1-trillion-ipo/498994#:~:text=the%20company's%20focus.-,OpenAI%20is%20reportedly%20eyeing%20an%20initial%20public%20offering%20%28&lt;a%20href='https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IPO'%20title='Renaissance%20IPO%20ETF'&gt;IPO&lt;/a&gt;)%20that,at%20up%20to%20$1%20trillion\" rel=\"noopener\">$1 trillion market cap</a>, investors will probably take their spending commitments more seriously.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>3) Investors Could Rotate Back Into The Mag 7:</strong> One way to get this bull market back on track is if investors decide that the Mag 7 stocks are now undervalued after recent declines over capex spending plans. I think stocks like Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) and Microsoft are deeply undervalued after plunging due to the announcement of increased capital expenditures. A recent Bank of America (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC\" title=\"Bank of America Corporation\">BAC</a>) investor <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/25/normally-staid-bond-investors-have-a-new-biggest-worry-an-ai-bubble.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">survey</a> suggests that an AI bubble is investors' biggest fear. However, many of the Mag 7 stocks are now trading far below market PE multiples.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By contrast, the recent rotation out of tech stocks and into consumer staples has pushed those valuations to levels that make no sense to me, unless this signals an approaching recession. This is especially true when considering the growth rates. For example, Walmart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>) now trades for about <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\">43 times </a>earnings, and earnings are expected to grow by around 10%. By contrast, Microsoft is now trading for just about half the multiple of Walmart, which is just around <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\">23 times </a>earnings, and it is expected to post higher growth rates for years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As this Seeking Alpha <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557783-from-ai-to-a1-sauce-staples-are-now-pricier-than-megacaps\">article</a> points out, consumer staple stocks are now more expensive than mega-cap tech stocks. If a bubble exists, it might be in consumer staple stocks, not the tech sector. Mega-cap tech stocks could regain favor soon because their valuations appear attractive, and this sector may have bottomed out. As shown below, the chart of the Roundhill Bug Tech ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAGS\" title=\"Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF\">MAGS</a>) recently touched the 200-day moving average, and it has rebounded slightly from that level. This could signal that these tech stocks are poised to rebound.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311812802134_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"990\" data-height=\"817\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311812802134_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"528\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311812802134_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311812802134_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311812802134_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311812802134_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>StockCharts.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>4) Geopolitical Tensions:</strong> There are several global hotspots, and tensions between the United States and Iran appear to be growing. If diplomacy succeeds, or if any potential military action in the Middle East is short-lived, the stock market could be poised for a relief rally. I plan to use any stock market weakness stemming from geopolitical tensions as a buying opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>5) Seasonal Trends: </strong>February is not <a href=\"https://tradethatswing.com/seasonal-patterns-of-the-stock-market/?srsltid=AfmBOor6fRsSMx7-XZb_SFbsZ7nDH5wSGj68Za_PH1qXGRhVNvWw0A3M\" rel=\"nofollow\">historically</a> known as a strong month for the stock market. By contrast, March and April are typically two of the best months for stocks. Perhaps this seasonal pattern will play out and get the bull market back on track with new potential highs in the coming weeks. During March and April, we might see the impact of bigger tax refunds, which could also support the bull case. Some analysts believe that many consumers might <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/02/18/stocks-150-billion-yolo-trade-tax-returns-wells-fargo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">invest their tax refunds into the stock </a>market, and this could be another upcoming positive.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Downside Risks Could Lead To A Bear Market</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stock market valuations are high and possibly priced for perfection. Margin debt is near <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/key-topics/margin-accounts/margin-statistics\" rel=\"nofollow\">record high levels</a>, which has often set the stage for a bear market. JPMorgan Chase (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM\" title=\"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.\">JPM</a>) CEO Jamie Dimon recently <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/24/economy/jamie-dimon-warning\" rel=\"nofollow\">warned</a> about private credit, AI euphoria, and potential loan losses in the financial sector. The job market has been showing weakness for the past few months, and AI-related job losses could be poised to increase as time goes by.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are just some of the many warning signs that could threaten the bull market and lead us into a bear market. When we see very strong earnings from Nvidia, yet the stock drops, it is a troubling sign and could be one more indicator that the bull market has topped out. If the stock market can't rally on good news (such as a strong earnings season), the path of least resistance could be lower. We could continue to see consolidation for a bit longer, where the market seemingly stagnates, but I believe the longer this drags out, the more likely it will resolve to the downside.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think there is still a good chance that investors will pile back into mega-cap tech stocks due to better valuations after a recent selloff. The valuations of stocks like Microsoft and Amazon look attractive when compared to historical valuations or to companies like Walmart. Fears about AI disruption may have become overblown, and if these fears ease, the software sector could rebound and help get the bull market back on track.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If AI startups like OpenAI and Anthropic have strong IPOs, this could renew investor interest in tech stocks and quell fears about an AI bubble. While there is still probably some time for the bulls to reassert control of this market, I think time is running out, especially since Nvidia's earnings results seem to have failed as an upside catalyst. I believe this is a higher-risk moment for the market, and as such, I am keeping high levels of cash in my portfolio so that I am prepared for market pullbacks. At the same time, I can't pass up opportunities to buy stocks like Amazon and Microsoft when their valuations are much lower today than they were just weeks ago.</p>",

At that time, I thought that perhaps the business might be worthy of an upgrade. This followed a plunge in the share price<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> of 15.3% at a time when the S&amp;P 500 was up 18.9%. At the end of the day, however, I decided against upgrading it. Revenue and profitability had slipped compared to what the company saw in 2024. And, I claimed, the business looked mostly fairly valued as opposed to undervalued. So instead of upgrading it, I reaffirmed it as a \"Hold\" candidate. For context, whenever I rate a company a \"Hold,\" I am making the claim that the stock should perform more or less similarly to the broader market for the foreseeable future. Since that day, we have seen that transpire. Shares are up 12.4%, only narrowly outperforming the 11.5% increase that the market enjoyed.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a purely fundamental standpoint, management has continued to capture revenue growth. But the bottom line for the business has been more complicated. While net profits and adjusted net profits have pulled back, cash flows are on the rise. The good news is that management is implementing additional cost-savings initiatives throughout 2026. As things stand, the company looks pretty much fairly valued on an absolute basis and might be a bit pricey relative to other firms that have similarities to it. Given this, I think that maintaining my \"Hold\" rating is the right choice here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s too early for an upgrade</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of this writing, investors have data for the company extending through the entirety of <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/8818/000000881826000004/ex9918k2-4x26.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/8818/000000881826000004/ex9918k2-4x26.htm\" target=\"_blank\">2025</a>. Obviously, this means the final quarter of the year as well. For that time, the business actually did quite well. Revenue came in at $2.27 billion, which exceeded the $2.19 billion the business reported a year earlier. Based on the data provided, this expansion was driven in large part by the company’s Materials Group, which operates as a provider of label materials, graphics, and reflective materials. It also provides certain functional bonding materials like tapes.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628687350867_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2108\" data-height=\"856\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628687350867_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"260\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"260\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628687350867_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628687350867_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628687350867_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628687350867_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Year over year, revenue for the business jumped 5.1%, from $1.47 billion to $1.55 billion. This is great to see in and of itself. However, the devil is in the details here. Most of the revenue increase was actually driven by foreign currency fluctuations. If we strip those out, we would get a rise of just 0.3%. And to make matters worse, actual organic growth was negative to the tune of 0.9%. There were certain areas of strength, most notably high-value categories like the Intelligent Labels offerings that jumped at a high single-digit rate. Graphics and reflectives were up at a low single-digit rate as well. But on the whole, while the company did see a rise in volume and favorable changes in product mix, lower prices that it had to pass on to consumers because of deflation ultimately pushed organic results lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also have the Solutions Group segment, which focuses on providing information and branding solutions to customers. Specific examples here include data management and digital identification associated with branding and embellishment, in addition to those same services for things like pricing and retail media and productivity. One thing that the company prides itself on is its emphasis on providing ultra-high-frequency RFID solutions that are vital for the modern-day supply chain. Everything from the food and grocery space to general retail, to the apparel market, to even aspects of the industrial economy, benefits from these types of solutions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue here was up only slightly, inching up 1.5% from $713.7 million to $724.2 million. The good news was that all of this was organic in nature, with management chalking that up to sales in the Intelligent Labels category popping at a low single-digit rate, Embelex-related revenue up at a high single-digit rate, and Vestcom growing in excess of 10%. While the Intelligent Labels portion of the company is more well-known, these other two are lesser known by market participants. For context, Embelex focuses on providing certain apparel and retail branding solutions, including woven and printed garment labels, heat transfers and embellishments, hashtags and trims, and the like. Meanwhile, Vestcom specializes in store shelf communication and pricing systems like shelf tags and price labels, promotional signage, digital shelf labeling integration technologies, and more. Overall, I would say that these value-added offerings certainly are appealing, and they proved that, at a time when more commoditized offerings are suffering, the company has some growth potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, even though revenue for the business improved, profitability took a hit. Net income contracted from $174 million to $166.4 million. Even on an adjusted basis, we get a contraction from $191.4 million to $189.4 million. Management blamed this weakness on higher employee-related costs and, when it came to the Solutions Group segment, investments aimed at growth opportunities. The good news is that cash flow at least increased. Operating cash flow jumped from $351.2 million to $376.8 million. If we adjust for changes in working capital, we would get a rise from $257.9 million to $281 million. And finally, EBITDA for the business expanded from $358.1 million to $367 million.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625531270142_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2288\" data-height=\"862\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625531270142_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"241\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"241\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625531270142_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625531270142_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625531270142_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625531270142_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The final quarter of the 2025 fiscal year was not a blip on the radar. In fact, even though revenue for the business has continued to grow in recent years, ever since 2024 came to an end, profitability has taken a hit. In the chart above, you can see precisely what I mean. The good news here is that management is working to correct these profit issues. For 2026, management has not provided any comprehensive financial guidance. They did provide some estimates for the first quarter, with reported sales growth estimated to be between 5% and 7%, while organic sales growth should be between 0% and 2%. Economic conditions remain problematic, but the company is targeting incremental cost savings resulting from restructuring actions of around $50 million for the year. Between that and the prospect of share buybacks, they expect earnings growth to occur this year as opposed to a contraction in earnings like what we saw last year.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625820956721_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2054\" data-height=\"934\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625820956721_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trading Multiples\" width=\"640\" height=\"291\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"291\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625820956721_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625820956721_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625820956721_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625820956721_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond this, we don't really know what to expect. In all likelihood, the company will return additional capital to shareholders. This follows about $570 million of share buybacks during 2025 and $290 million of dividends. But unless we see a significant improvement in profitability, the stock is not cheap enough to justify a bullish outlook. In the chart above, you can see how shares are valued using results from 2024 and 2025. On an absolute basis, this is certainly not a bad picture. However, when it comes to other companies that have similarities to it, namely those in the packaging industry, it's not exactly the most compelling prospect. In that same chart, you can see that three of the five firms that I compared it to are cheaper than it is on a price-to-earnings and on an EV-to-EBITDA basis. Meanwhile, four of them are cheaper when it comes to the price-to-operating-cash-flow approach.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Long term, there certainly is potential for the business. In fact, in the image below, you can see their estimate, measured by units, of the size of the Intelligent Labels market. Across all categories that the company already plays in, it <a href=\"https://s205.q4cdn.com/945924874/files/doc_presentations/2026/Feb/16/AVY-Investor-Presentation-February-2026.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://s205.q4cdn.com/945924874/files/doc_presentations/2026/Feb/16/AVY-Investor-Presentation-February-2026.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a> the unit opportunity to be around 350 billion a year. And this is just the addressable market. It does not include the total market size that is substantially greater. What's more, in addition to focusing on growth in its existing addressable markets, the company has a history of expanding into new ones. In fact, since 2021, the company has experienced an expansion in its total addressable market of about 20 billion units.

It is specifically focused on what it calls high-value categories. Right now in the Materials Group segment, only 38% of sales fall under the high-value designation. But when it comes to the Solutions Group segment, that number is around 60%. For the business in its entirety, about 45% of sales come from high-value offerings, which represents a nice increase over the 33% seen back in 2019. Geographically, the company is also intensely interested in growing into emerging markets. About 39% of the revenue associated with the Materials Group segment comes from those areas. Management has not provided an estimate of how much of the revenue coming from the Solutions Group segment is attributable to emerging markets. But we do know that the overwhelming majority of sales come from developed markets like the U<span>nited States</span> and Canada, as well as Europe. In total, about 30% of the firm's revenue comes from emerging markets, though. So there should be some growth prospects there. As expansion into high-value categories increases, you can expect profit margins to grow as well.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628505373278_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2546\" data-height=\"1378\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628505373278_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"346\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"346\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628505373278_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628505373278_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628505373278_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628505373278_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Avery Dennison</span></p></figcaption></figure> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on the data provided, I would make the case that Avery Dennison remains an interesting prospect. But honestly, it's not one that I can get behind at this time. The company is decently priced, but it's nowhere near cheap enough to justify a bullish outlook. This is especially the case considering the recent profitability issues that management has relayed to investors. So for now, I think that maintaining it as a \"Hold\" candidate is the right move.</p>",

Acadia's CEO Debra Osteen told analysts on the company's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874594-acadia-healthcare-company-inc-achc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a> yesterday:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Over the last several years, we have expanded our footprint to over 12,500 beds, taking care of 84,000 patients per day.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557057-acadia-healthcare-outlines-3_37b-3_45b-2026-revenue-target-as-new-ceo-emphasizes-operational\">guidance for 2026</a>, Acadia is expecting to generate revenues of $3.37bn -$3.45bn, adjusted EBITDA of $575m - $610m, adjusted earnings by diluted share of $1.3 $1.55, and to make capital expenditures of $255m - $280m.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, Acadia reported a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACHC/balance-sheet\">cash position</a> of $133.2m with $595m available under its $1.0bn revolving credit facility and a net leverage ratio of 4x adjusted EBITDA. The long-term debt position was reported as $(2.47bn).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Analysis - New CEO Aims for Stability</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4839184-acadia-healthcare-another-earnings-shock-but-this-time-im-optimistic\">my last note</a> on Acadia for Seeking Alpha, published after Q3 earnings in early November, I discussed how:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>In late August 2024, Acadia stock traded &gt;$80 per share - very close to its all-time high (shares traded ~$90 briefly in late 2022), but collapsed in value in September 2024 as the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4154121-acadia-healthcare-plunges-20-additional-legal-scrutiny-comes-light\">company disclosed</a> that it had received a request for information and a jury subpoena from a U.S. Attorney and jury subpoena in two jurisdictions related to its admissions, length of stay and billing practices.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the company shared annual earnings and 2025 guidance in February last year, its stock retreated further in value, to ~$30 per share, and traded at $20 per share when I published my last note.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Multiple headwinds were buffeting Acadia's business at that time - then CEO Chris Hunter told analysts that:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>patient day growth fell short of expectations due to persistent softness in acute care Medicaid volumes and heightened payor scrutiny around authorizations. In addition, revenue was negatively impacted by elevated levels of bad debt and denials, which are expected to remain a headwind in the fourth quarter.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insurers faced shrinking budgets due to higher patient healthcare utilization, coupled with the U.S. government's refusal to hike payment rates to ease the burden on the sector, heightened by the fact the government was in shutdown at the time Q3 earnings were released.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a substantial amount of debt on its balance sheet and revenue growth negligible, perhaps the slide in Acadia's share price is understandable; however, I also noted in my last post that:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>In September, it was reported that the activist investor Engine Capital, which had built up a ~3% stake in Acadia, had <a href=\"https://enginecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Engine-Capital-Sends-Letter-to-Acadia-Healthcares-Board-of-Directors-Regarding-the-Urgent-Need-for-Strategy-and-Governance-Changes.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">written</a> to Acadia's Board of Directors, demanding changes to how the business was being run.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Engine outlined a series of issues it felt needed addressing by the management team and some strategy ideas to implement going forward, namely:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Strengthen the Board and Adhere to Best Corporate Governance Practices.</li> <li>Align Executive Compensation to Shareholder Value Creation.</li> <li>Immediately Halt All Growth Capital Investments.</li> <li>Prioritize Improving Operations and Rationalize the Company’s Cost Structure.</li> <li>Explore Asset Sales Across the Company’s Portfolio.</li> <li>Repurchase Undervalued Shares..</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I suggested this could be a catalyst for positive change at the company and also noted that \"whether the CEO survives may be open to question.\" Nevertheless, I gave the stock a Buy rating, writing:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>I am making Acadia a risky Buy opportunity. It is risky because a strategic turnaround of the business may need to be executed, and if it fails, shareholders may suffer substantial losses - and the entire business broken up. If it can succeed, however, the opportunities to enhance the value of a $1.9bn market cap business earning &gt;$3.5bn revenues per annum are self-evident.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In January this year, it was <a href=\"https://bhbusiness.com/2026/01/20/acadia-healthcare-reinstates-former-ceo-amid-70-stock-plunge/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> that CEO Hunter would be leaving his role to be replaced by former CEO Debbie Osteen, a decision that was cheered by the market, with shares rising in value from ~$11.5 to &gt;$15.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yesterday during the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874594-acadia-healthcare-company-inc-achc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a>, the new/old CEO told analysts:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The focus now is on delivering quality care for patients and consistent operational performance. We have the right mission, the right markets and the right foundation to deliver improved results. This work will take discipline and consistency. We remain focused on providing care with the highest standards for our patients and the communities we serve.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In response to one analyst's question re whether low- to mid-single-digit organic volume growth, low- to mid-single-digit pricing gains, and generating margin improvement were still possible, the CEO replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>I do think the demand continues to be very strong. And I certainly don't see anything that would impact that either short term or long term.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apparently, Engine Capital <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/finance/acadia-healthcare-stock-down-60-165808686.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">reduced</a> its holding of Acadia stock on February 23rd, so its commitment to the long-term recovery of Acadia may be waning, but the return of an experienced CEO - a steady hand on the tiller at a time of crisis - is likely a net positive, in my view.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking Ahead - 2026 and Beyond</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2026 does not look like being the year Acadia returns to growth and prosperity - its issues run too deep for such a fast turnaround. On its earnings call, the Chief Financial Officer - also relatively new to the role, as the previous CFO left their position last year, as did the Chief Operating Officer - said Acadia expected to add 400-600 beds in 2026:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>primarily through the opening of new facilities nearing completion. This includes 3 facilities with joint venture partners, including new hospitals with Tufts Medicine, Methodist Health and Orlando Health.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The CFO also told analysts, \"We anticipate full-year same-facility volume growth between 0% and 1%,\" reflecting 630 new beds added to the same-store bucket in Q1, offset by \"an approximate 350 basis point headwind to the same-facility growth from changes in the New York Medicaid program.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The CFO said they expected a 2%-3% increase in same-facility revenue per patient day and outlined expectations to generate positive free cash flow \"as we expect to see CapEx decline to a range of $255 million to $280 million.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The CFO also told analysts Acadia expected to earn between $820m and $830m of revenues in Q1, with adjusted EBITDA of $130m to $137m. Meanwhile, the CEO told analysts,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>I think that we would only consider closing beds if there's no clear path to viability. And our focus right now is really on operating and improving the existing portfolio. So we're not talking about closures at this point and don't anticipate being in that situation.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49171940-17721338302879863_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1274\" data-height=\"747\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49171940-17721338302879863_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"375\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"375\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49171940-17721338302879863_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49171940-17721338302879863_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49171940-17721338302879863_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49171940-17721338302879863_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EPS bridge <span>(presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown above, EPS is expected to decline in 2026, which arguably highlights the fact that 2026 is going to be a difficult reset year, with the new management team looking to correct mistakes made by the former management team.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, at this point in Acadia's evolution, arguably the numbers - in terms of revenues and earnings, at least, are less important than the fact that the market is reacting positively to changes in strategy. It's not always normal for a business's stock to leap in value when expectations for the coming year are set so low. As the CFO put it yesterday:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>right now, we're focused on delivering in '26, ramping the new facilities we put in the ground and then being very disciplined on CapEx in the years after that as we get back to generating free cash and really showing off the cash-generating power the underlying business has now that we have these beds available and as we fill them.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Concluding Analysis: Am I Upholding My Buy Rating On Stock For 2026?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's a difficult question to answer. Acadia stock is now up &gt;50% year-to-date and ~8% since my last Buy call, which is a positive, perhaps reflecting what is known in the sports world as a \"new manager bounce.\" But can it last?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are few signs currently that the health insurance industry and government are aligned on policy or payment rates - seemingly, the government wants to pay less, while the sector demands more help - and that is a headwind that could lead Acadia to have to downgrade guidance or miss, e.g., Q1 guidance, which could reverse the goodwill Wall Street is currently showing the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, Acadia is a &gt;$3bn revenue per annum company that generated &gt;$270m of GAAP net income in 2022 and &gt;$250m in 2024, owns a large portfolio of properties, and is capable of generating significant cash flow. As mentioned, as recently as August 2024, stock traded &gt;$80 per share, a premium of &gt;250%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Often, contrarian trades look very attractive by certain metrics - price to sales and price to adjusted EBITDA in Acadia's case, plus former share price highs, but can backfire spectacularly; businesses do not typically resolve deep-seated structural issues overnight.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, then, I am torn; however, I am opting to uphold my Buy rating because managing behavioral health issues is a massive industry, and therefore, a good management team (with a proven track record) will always stand a good chance of making a business like Acadia work, in my view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is clearly not an easy business to be in, and Acadia has suffered some significant reputational damage, being subject to investigations by the<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/acadia-healthcare-company-inc-pay-1985m-settle-allegations-relating-medically-unnecessary\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Department of Justice</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-118\" rel=\"nofollow\">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (source: behavioral health business) and having <a href=\"https://bhbusiness.com/2026/01/20/acadia-healthcare-reinstates-former-ceo-amid-70-stock-plunge/\" rel=\"nofollow\">settled</a> a securities fraud lawsuit by agreeing to pay $179m in November last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would preach extreme caution, however - last April, I identified agilon health (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AGL\" title=\"agilon health, inc.\">AGL</a>) as a potentially strong contrarian trade opportunity in the healthcare space, and shares are down 89% since that note at the time of writing.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As discussed, structural issues faced by distressed businesses often prove too deep-seated to fix, but in Acadia's case, for the time being at least, I feel as though the new CEO deserves time to implement new plans and potentially drag Acadia's business out of the doldrums.</p>",
