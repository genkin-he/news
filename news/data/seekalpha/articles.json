And this is<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> largely justified as their demand has worsened thanks to competitive and macro pressures, two variables I vastly underestimated.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The go-forward question, however, remains: is this just a temporal deterioration that stabilizes, or a structural one that would then support their current price? I find the former more likely and correspondingly see various paths for outperformance, but I’m still not buying.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sales: Share Loss Structural?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here’s the year-over-year financial summary: sales have gone from <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/10269868\">$602M</a> to $483M as their community absorption rate declined from 4.3x to 3x, more than offsetting their growth in communities from 128 to 146 (ASPs were roughly flat at $365K). Total closings declined from 1,655 to 1,323.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Included in those figures is a mix of both their Wholesale and Retail business. Parsed out, Wholesale closings actually grew year-over-year from 117 homes last year to 237 in Q2, with revenue correspondingly growing from ~$36M to ~$71M today. Retail, however, materially weighed on results - total closings declined from 1,538 to 1,086, with revenue declining from ~$566M to ~$412M. So, when we’re thinking about the sales decline, we’re really contextualizing the decline in their Retail business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Digging in, I think this decline reflects a mix of both market-related and competitive pressures. Management kicked off the Q2 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4808972-lgi-homes-inc-lgih-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">call</a> noting that “elevated mortgage rates contributed to the affordability pressures weighing on entry-level buyers,” and that “heightened economic uncertainty has created a softer sales environment, which buyers are still exploring the idea of home ownership, but are taking longer to make decisions and, in some cases, choosing to delay their purchases.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some of this seems to have some qualitative truth - i.e., it’s not inconceivable that consumers are deferring home purchases amid today’s economic climate. Indeed, from one angle, there has been a slight <a href=\"https://www.mba.org/news-and-research/newsroom/news/2025/05/13/mortgage-delinquencies-increase-slightly-in-the-first-quarter-of-2025\" rel=\"noopener\">uptick in FHA</a> mortgage delinquencies in 2025. Or, alternatively, PulteGroup (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PHM\" title=\"PulteGroup, Inc.\">PHM</a>) has seen a single-digit decline in orders, citing that while “consumers remain engaged in the home buying process … they are proceeding with caution given concerns,” so industry conditions are not better, to say the least.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, when I zoom out on the landscape, we can see some of LGI’s competitors, like Meritage Homes (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTH\" title=\"Meritage Homes Corporation\">MTH</a>) and Lennar (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LEN\" title=\"Lennar Corporation\">LEN</a>) reporting roughly flat year-over-year orders and closings. Furthermore, rates are about the <a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/61853/30-year-mortgage-rates-chart\" rel=\"nofollow\">same</a>, so I don’t really buy this argument that they’ve lost a material number of customers for macro reasons. And we can see industry <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/new-home-sales\" rel=\"nofollow\">data</a> showing a roughly similar demand level year-over-year for new home sales across the U.S.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, that’s not to say there’s some general market softness; however, there’s clearly a wide disconnect between the demand changes that LGI has seen and the rest of the industry. If, then, LGI’s demand reflected a change in market factors - e.g., interest rates, uncertainty - we’d see a similar demand impact on some of their competitors, but this clearly isn’t being reflected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is true that part of LGI’s absorption decline stems from a “one-time”-ish impact from the addition of new communities. That is, new communities tend to be, on average, less productive in their initial phases, so as they’ve increased the mix of these (from 128 last year to 146 today), that should have slightly reduced their absorption rate. However, we know this was only part of the degradation, as total closings were down despite more communities, implying their “existing” communities sold many fewer homes today than last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The only logical conclusion from this, then, is that they lost customers to some of their competitors, as evidenced by the referenced data above. And there seems to be a reasonable explanation: increased incentives by competitors. Let’s take Lennar as an example. In Q3 last year, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/10496168#source=section%3Asummary%7Csection_asset%3Aall_news%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A3\">Lennar posted 22.5%</a> gross margins - today, those margins are 17.5%, and that’s not because costs grew. It’s because, as Lennar points out, they’ve increased their incentives offered. D.R. Horton (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DHI\" title=\"D.R. Horton, Inc.\">DHI</a>) too saw their gross margins decline ~200 bps to ~22%, with approximately half attributed to increased incentives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Concurrently - and importantly - LGI has not really been increasing their incentives at the same rate. ASPs were just marginally higher year-over-year at ~$365K, and had it not been for increased Wholesale mix, the ASP would have actually been a little higher thanks to the “geographic mix” in the quarter. This trend reflects that (1) they’re not materially reducing listed pricing anywhere and (2) there’s no material pressure from previously reported trends of customers trending down to lower square footage homes that have a lower price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, they can keep prices unchanged but increase their incentives (COGS) offered. To this end, LGI’s adjusted gross margins are indeed down 150 bps year-over-year, and part of this does indeed stem from increased incentives, which they confirmed back at the start of the year and have noted on Q1 and Q2 calls. However, considering that part of the gross margin decline also came from increased Wholesale mix and operating deleverage, the increase in incentives could have conceivably only been something like 60-80 bps of that. So, compared to what we’ve seen from someone like Lennar, the improvement in their competitors’ value proposition seemingly exceeds LGI’s improvement, supporting this hypothesis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Inversely, there’s not really any other great explanation for the decline in demand year-over-year (materially speaking). One could suggest a share loss to apartments (a considered alternative by their customers), which I suppose has maybe some merit, but not that much. <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250707370880/en/Apartments.com-Releases-Multifamily-Rent-Growth-Report-for-Second-Quarter-of-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">CoStar released</a> data for Q2 2025 showing apartment rents nationally growing year-over-year in the first half of 2025 and in Q2 specifically, not necessarily something consistent with a structural shift to apartments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, I’m largely at odds with management's take on what’s been driving the decline in Retail closings. They’ve been chalking it up to “affordability” or “market” degradation, but that simply doesn’t square away with the data I’m seeing. Share loss appears to be the better explanation as customers find more attractive prices from competitors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If this is true, what do we make of absorption rates going forward? They’re guiding for ~1.2K closings in Q3 across 145 communities, or an absorption rate of ~2.75x. Typically, there’s some seasonally driven decline from Q2 here, so this isn’t terribly concerning, but clearly, their guidance reflects that today’s demand was not driven by some major one-time issue - this is a good reflection of current (weakened) demand conditions. And there also doesn’t appear to be any predicted, abnormal pressure from anticipated Wholesale closing declines. On a run rate basis, then, absorption rates appear to be about 2.8x-ish on an annual basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I think about where this could trend to, I envision a few different ends of the outcome range. On one end, it’s conceivable that competitors continue to price even lower (increase incentives) while LGI remains steadfast on maintaining their margin. This, however, doesn’t appear sustainable, as I believe LGI would ultimately reduce price to retain customers - they know their price elasticity better than I do, but at some point, the price reduction would be smaller than the cost savings from lower volume.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And indeed, they admitted on the Q2 call to “leaning” into more incentives lately, which would support this go-forward approach. Or said differently, they’re guiding for 24.5% adjusted gross margins in Q3, which would be 100 bps lower than the 25.5% reported in Q2. Their explanation on the call was that they “...always want more pace, leading to our discussion on gross margin, we're forecasting slightly lower gross margin because we are leaning into incentives, especially on the older aged inventory.” So, I find it reasonable that LGI starts to more closely match their competitors' incentive changes, thus reducing share loss.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, is it possible that the industry sustains a lower margin profile beyond today’s levels? It’s not inconceivable. Looking at Lennar again, we can see that their current high-teens gross margins are lower than their low-20% gross margins historically. And if we run some over-simplistic math on returns-on-tangible-capital, Lennar is posting sub-10% returns now, or average-to-below-average at this point. So, we’re clearly closer to the bottom range of sustainable rational outcomes, but I personally wouldn’t rule out an extended period - say, 2-3 years - of below-average margins across the industry. Things take time to turn, and the world doesn’t always operate rationally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But if we are at the bottom of the range, though, in terms of how far players will take their price, and we also assume that LGI will start matching incentives to a roughly similar magnitude, a long-term absorption rate of 3x would make sense to me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The alternative end of the spectrum is pretty much just the inverse - prices return to historical averages as each company attempts to earn a reasonable return on capital (development costs), which would essentially drive a good chunk of demand back to LGI as they wouldn’t increase prices as much as competitors implicitly would. In the scenario, LGI could certainly be doing 4x+ absorption rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, there’s a final element here, which is just general market demand levels. At the moment, there appears to be some decent stability, or perhaps slightly worse conditions than last year. When I zoom out, however, we’re not in some abnormal, unsustainable demand territory that’s artificially propped up. That is, new home sales are about where they were pre-COVID, which more or less matches long-term historical averages.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where this goes from here, I don’t think anyone really knows. Per history, we could maintain stability around these levels, or we could see increased demand from external drivers (lower rates), or the opposite (higher rates). Sustainably speaking, however, I’m fine assuming some 10% bound around those absorption rates. That is, I think there’s a range of outcomes where LGI is doing 2.75x absorption rates over time and an outcome where they’re doing 4.5x. Layer on another 0.25x from new community rate maturity, and we’ll call it 3-4.75x. And in both scenarios, I don’t mind assuming 0-1% cost inflation to their current $365K ASP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, the biggest assumption I’m making is that the declines we’ve seen versus last year are not perpetual, but just stemming from a widened price gap. At some point, either (1) this stops, or (2) LGI increases incentives accordingly to maintain share before it stops. But I don’t find it sustainable long-term for the industry to price materially lower than they’re currently realizing, otherwise returns-on-capital would seemingly fall to uninvestable territory. And as far as new entrants and/or structural market changes, there are worthy items to consider, but none that I think materially change the long-term picture for LGI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The final variable is their long-term community count. As referenced above, this grew quite a bit year-over-year, from 128 to 146, with LGI opening up new communities across all regions. My conclusion hasn’t really changed here - I still think there’s room for them to grow to 200+ over time, and their belief hasn’t really changed either, as they note that “[d]irectionally, it should be increasing.” In the meantime, though, their previously stated guidance for 160+ by year-end is not likely. Indeed, they’re guiding for 145 in Q3 with the pullback due to economic reasons (lower returns on capital).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And it’s true - historically, they’ve posted returns on equity of ~20%, but given the current demand conditions, those returns are closer to 8-10% on a run rate basis, or about average. So, there are two extremes here. On the one hand, they may ultimately decide that notwithstanding economics recovering to historical levels, they’d open new communities anyway and grow to, say, 200. The other extreme, however, which is more evidenced by recent moves, is that they materially curtail community growth and send those dollars back to shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m personally assuming path 1 is more likely - i.e., they grow. Consistent with this model, they’re going to have to front about $1B+ in capital via inventory growth to support another ~50 communities. Of course, this varies depending on community size, but I expect that to remain relatively consistent with today’s profile. And it also depends on how much inventory they want to carry - as they noted on the call, they’ll be reducing inventory in the near term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All considered, then, my model looks something like this. I have a community count of 200, from which I contextualize there to be two scenarios - one in which they post 3x absorption rates and another where they post 4.75x. With $390K as an ASP, sales would range from ~$2.8B to ~$4.4B.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margins: Sales Dependent</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">LGI’s adjusted gross margin declined 150 bps to 25.5%, and GAAP EBIT margin declined 300 bps to 8.2%. Management called out the gross margin decline on the call, citing “...higher percentage of wholesale closings and, to a lesser extent, higher lot costs and higher capitalized interest as a percentage of revenue as well as reduced operating leverage…”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The capitalized interest variable is excluded in adjusted gross margins, but the rest of the variables make sense - Wholesale was indeed higher and carries lower gross margins, and the reduced absorption rates result in less fixed cost leverage, although this is a smaller percentage of COGS as most of COGS is comprised of the individual home construction (variable costs). Also, it’s worth recalling that back in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4779449-lgi-homes-inc-lgih-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q1</a>, they were seeing increased costs, although it’s possible these have yet to fully flow through yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I’ve discussed above, though, a good chunk - despite being unmentioned - of the gross margin decline likely had to do with increased incentives. That is, while ASPs are roughly unchanged, incentives - rate buydowns, closing costs - have increased, increasing their COGS relative to sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With respect to OPEX, this declined with G&amp;A relatively unchanged, while selling expenses declined from ~$53M to ~$41.6M. They cited “more efficient advertising spend” as the reason for the selling expense decline, which I tend to contextualize as just lower ad spend. It’s worth pointing out that for the first half of the year, advertising spend is actually “higher” despite lower sales, so increased “efficiency” seems moot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Qualitatively speaking, though, selling expenses should have had two mixed changes. For one, the increase in community count entails increased headcount - sales reps and managers - to support those communities. Countering this, however, was a decrease in the absorption rates/closings that reduced their sales commission expense. And this latter variable should have driven the bulk of the year-over-year selling expense decline, more than offsetting the headcount cost increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thinking about what this means going forward, I don’t find it to be all that complex, as sales are really going to be the driver of long-term margins, or more specifically, closings. Right now, the 8.2% EBIT margins translate into ~8%-ish on an annual run rate basis (Q2 is a decently average quarter per year).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we think about scenario 1, where they earn ~$2.8B in sales, this entails an absorption rate roughly equal to today’s run rate and a higher community count. I’m assuming in this scenario, though, that competitors remain aggressive on incentives and that LGI would choose to more or less match them, but I’m not assuming it materially degrades beyond today’s conditions (a potentially perilous assumption). As I referenced above, adjusted gross margins are guided to 24.5% in Q3, reflecting LGI’s willingness to match competitive conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So relative to today, based on industry margins starting to encroach on the lower end of returns on capital, if we assume that they remain here long-term, this would translate into another 100 bps EBIT margin headwind. Layering on minimal additional operating leverage as my absorption rate estimate remains unchanged, and long-term EBIT margins would look like 7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Scenario 2 would simply be a lot of the opposite. Absorption rate would return to 4x+ levels, implying that industry prices/margins improve and that LGI would be able to retain at least their current gross margins. Layer on, then, the additional operating leverage per community, and that would probably translate into a margin closer to 10%, more consistent with their history when absorption rates were much higher.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I touched on this earlier, but two capital allocation paths could unfold - they can acquire inventory to grow communities, or send FCF back to shareholders. I’m assuming they’ll invest in inventory to support future community growth as noted earlier (to what I think will be ~$1B+).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, I’ll just reiterate what I’ve noted in prior articles, which is that they don’t *have* to acquire all new inventory. That is, they’re running inventory at ~185% of sales, a level that is far higher than they justifiably need (the delta is management reportedly finding attractive prices). Thus, it could be that community growth to the 200 mark entails using a mix of already purchased inventory and newly acquired inventory, which would materially change the cash flows (and thus, IRR). For conservatism's sake, I’m assuming inventory remains at these levels and shareholders don’t get this benefit yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Put together, here’s how I’m contextualizing the prospective IRR. In one scenario, I think LGI could be doing sales and EBIT of $2.8B/$197M over time (FY35). If that’s realized and remains at a structural, sustainable level, investors would earn something like a 7-8% IRR. On the other hand, if reality is the second scenario ($4.4B/$445M), I calculate an IRR closer to 12-13%. (For more specifics, I’m taking their EBIT, subtracting tax, capex, and their inventory investment along the way to calculate the go-forward free cash flow.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Does this make for an attractive bet? Well, it depends on your opportunity cost. But from an absolute return perspective, it’s an okay return per what I’d deem a reasonable range of outcomes. Again, the key assumption that I’m making is that LGI is not structurally broken such that they’re a perpetual share loser. And the other key assumption that I’m making is that the housing market or competitive conditions don’t collapse in 2-5 years, neither of which are certain, and this frankly scares me from an investment perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is an important one. If, for whatever reason, the industry sees prolonged demand reductions and/or prolonged pricing irrationality, that could easily knock a good 100-200 bps off an investor’s return. And that's not considering other random variables such as tariffs. On the other hand, though, there is the conceivable scenario that they materially reduce inventory to lower (sustainable) levels and that materially adds to the IRR in this event.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having purchased LGI at materially higher levels, there’s this psychological urge to assume that (1) since I don’t believe the business is broken and (2) conditions are worse off today than they were then, (3) the IRR must be attractive today. And in some scenarios, I think LGI will outperform from today—and materially—but it’s not obvious that’ll be the realized scenario. For that reason and given other investments out there, LGI will remain just a tiny percentage of my portfolio.</p>",

Thermal companies normally cash flow rather generously on their own without big news like this. Still, if anyone was wondering where the cash was coming from to finance the MEG Energy (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MEGEF\" title=\"MEG Energy Corp.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">OTCPK:MEGEF</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) acquisition (where the </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4512300-meg-energy-meeting-on-cenovus-deal-postponed-another-week\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">vote was delayed</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> one more time), the answer is a very unusual \"the company raised the cash all by itself\". There is a whole lot going on here, and it all appears to be positive for shareholders. The company may still borrow money to finance the acquisition. But it is also quite capable of raising whatever cash is needed.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4828616-cenovus-ups-the-ante-for-meg-energy\">last article</a> mentioned that the final offer for MEG Energy was raised a little bit, which got Strathcona (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STHRF\" title=\"Strathcona Resources Ltd.\">OTCPK:STHRF</a>) to vote its shares in favor of the acquisition. But a regulatory inquiry forced a postponement of the vote for another week until next week. That postponement allowed the sale of the refineries to close and the company to report a flood of incoming cash (as in billions of cash).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similarly, earnings went way past positive. Management has long been working with a group of acquired assets to get those assets running in an optimal fashion. This company has long been known for its low-cost upstream operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But the acquired refineries were another matter entirely. Those refineries needed a lot of work. Now that work seems to be bearing some fruit that investors can actually see.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">(Note: Cenovus is a Canadian company that reports using Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted.)</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761930618927718_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cenovus Energy Summary Of Quarterly Financial Results\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"273\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761930618927718_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761930618927718_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761930618927718_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761930618927718_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761930618927718_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761930618927718_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761930618927718_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761930618927718_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cenovus Energy Summary Of Quarterly Financial Results (Cenovus Energy Earnings Press Release October 31, 2025)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The huge jump in earnings translated into one of the largest free cash flow funds reported in recent memory. Now much of the excess funds went to buying back stock because, as management reported, nearly C$1 billion in shares were repurchased.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This has delayed a return of the net debt back to the net debt target yet again. But it is also a sign of the fact that this investment grade company considers that debt well within easy handling range. But it also means that the stock price represents such value that it is worth deferring the debt goal for a bit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Once the acquisition of MEG Energy closes, there could well be some more noncore sales of assets to quickly keep the net debt measurement within an allowable range (or long-term goal range). This company has long been known for making acquisitions and quickly fixing the balance sheet to where it wants it to be. This coming acquisition should be no exception.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Refining</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, steady progress is being made with the refining system.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17619310690560102_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cenovus Energy Summary Of Refining Progress\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17619310690560102_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17619310690560102_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17619310690560102_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17619310690560102_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17619310690560102_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17619310690560102_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17619310690560102_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-17619310690560102_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cenovus Energy Summary Of Refining Progress (Cenovus Energy Corporate Earnings Presentation Third Quarter 2025)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown above, management has been working on the acquired refining system probably ever since the acquisition some years back. However, the improvement projects are now getting to the point where the progress shown above is getting to the point where results are becoming apparent to investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Understand that just the acquisition of refining capacity allows this company to report that significant amounts of production bypass the issues with selling a discounted product on the open market. That issue has long plagued company results (and held back the stock price as a result).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, there was clearly more money to be made by optimizing the acquired refining system. Unfortunately, progress is relatively slow at one turnaround project at a time. I have covered some of this in the past because only the larger, more significant projects really had any effect on results. But now, the cumulative effects of all the improvements made are becoming apparent, as shown above. There is likely more progress coming in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would expect that the MEG Energy acquisition would raise the priority for still more refining capacity through construction of that capacity or by yet another acquisition when a suitable deal presents itself.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Throughput</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This company is not afraid to hold back production when market conditions are less than optimal. One of the contributors to the big quarter was a whole lot of production, as shown below. Now this rather favorable quarter is going to make for a tough comparison next year. Fortunately, that is not yet on the market's radar. Even when it does get to be a market consideration, the MEG Energy acquisition will likely help comparisons by the time this quarter arrives next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761931863317274_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cenovus Energy Third Quarter Throughput Summary Comparison\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"181\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761931863317274_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761931863317274_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761931863317274_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761931863317274_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761931863317274_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761931863317274_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761931863317274_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/1102834-1761931863317274_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cenovus Energy Third Quarter Throughput Summary Comparison (Cenovus Energy Earnings Press Release Third Quarter 2025)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The sale of the refinery interests netted C$1.8 billion on October 1. This and the decision to increase the number of shares offered to roughly 50% of the total offer to acquire MEG Energy may make this one of the more conservative deals I have covered.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile management continues to both grow production and improve the operations of the assets managed. A combination of decisions resulted in a quarter with a lot of free cash flow just when it was needed. This is an understated characteristic of above average management. The cash arrived at just the right time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cenovus Energy continues to be a strong buy idea as the now much larger company begins a transition from a growth story towards a growth and income story. Opportunistic acquisitions and sales will continue to be a material part of the company's future. That may well mean that the average return of these shares is likely to be in the mid-teens over the long-term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The oil and gas industry continues to be largely out of favor in the current market. So, there could be some recovery potential that would result in a higher valuation in the future for the same results currently posted.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a regulatory inquiry that has delayed the meeting on the approval of the acquisition of MEG Energy. That regulatory inquiry could potentially derail the whole acquisition idea, or it could make the acquisition more costly than anticipated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This company continues to benefit from advancing technology that has improved many of the deals made over time. Technological advances can theoretically stop at any time. There are no guarantees or assurances that technology will continue to advance to provide cost savings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Future commodity prices are volatile and have low visibility. A severe and sustained downturn of those prices could materially change the future of the company.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

However, even Molina's marketplace plans were not immune to rising costs, as plans purchased through state exchanges had a medical cost ratio of 95.6%, significantly higher than expected, according to the CEO.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>ACA issues loom</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rate issues are not limited to Medicaid, as UnitedHealth joined a growing chorus of insurers expecting to be affected by changes in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ACA plans, which are offered through state-based marketplaces and directly from insurers rather than through an employer, have been under scrutiny as the extension of tax credits to lower plan costs has become a key issue for the ongoing federal government shutdown. While the issue remains unresolved, most insurers have already priced in the expectation that the tax credits will not be extended.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">UnitedHealth's insurance arm submitted rate filings in nearly all of the 30 states where it offers ACA plans, reflecting an average rate increase of over 25%, according to Noel. Consequently, the company expects its ACA membership to drop significantly, Noel said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"Where we are unable to reach agreement on sustainable rates, we are enacting targeted service area reductions,\" Noel said. \"We believe these actions will establish a sustainable premium base while likely reducing our ACA enrollment by approximately two-thirds.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite these challenges, analysts at J.P. Morgan ranked the insurer's stock \"overweight,\" noting that the company expects to expand margins in 2026 through improvements in Medicare Advantage and commercial plans, which will offset the expected margin contraction in Medicaid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"We see this as not necessarily dissimilar from commentary in the second quarter; however, with the benefit of several more months of claims/trend progression, we think the incremental visibility underlines this positive commentary,\" the analysts wrote.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The ACA rate repricing may prove to be a more significant challenge for Centene Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNC\" title=\"Centene Corporation\">CNC</a>), which has a disproportionately large number of members in the plans compared to its similarly sized competitors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During a third quarter earnings call, Centene CEO Sarah London touted the benefits of extending ACA tax credits and said Centene believes \"these tax credits offer critical support for hard-working Americans, small business owners, and rural healthcare infrastructure.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Centene received a \"neutral\" rating from J.P. Morgan, and analysts cautioned about ongoing cost impacts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"On balance, we continue to view Centene an execution story with wide error bars in 2026, albeit one showing progress on execution, and we expect much of the focus will be on proving out assumptions and how Centene is able to recover ACA Exchange margins in 2026, with both factors needing to see further progress before investors turn more constructive,\" the analysts wrote.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2025/10/us-health-insurer-shares-stumble-after-q3-earnings-as-cost-pressures-mount-94468495\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

My 2025 pick was Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>): I believed<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the market had overestimated the threats to Google’s search businesses by AI and antitrust.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the time, Alphabet was trading at a P/E ratio of 17, compared to the S&amp;P average of 24. For Alphabet, these “existential” threats were akin to being trapped inside a speeding car with a wasp - potentially serious, in the moment, but in hindsight, more of a nuisance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, Google’s search share <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share\" rel=\"noopener\">remains around 90%</a>, and the company is integrating AI into its results. Google, not OpenAI, will likely continue to monopolize search.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of monopoly, Alphabet lost its search and advertising lawsuits, but the remedy/punishment it was given was the equivalent of me threatening (again) to take my son’s phone away (i.e., meaningless). By the way, Alphabet is up 61% year over year, second only to Tesla in the Magnificent 7.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Stock of 2026</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where the market overestimated Alphabet’s existential threats, I believe it’s underestimating Amazon’s (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a></span>) not-so-secret weapon (automation) and missing its next growth engine (retail). For more than a decade, people thought of Amazon as a cloud company with a retail unit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWS and the ad business drove its margin expansion, while on the retail side, fulfillment and shipping costs increased faster than sales. Two years ago, Amazon began to reverse that trend. Investments in automation, primarily robotics but also AI, are beginning to deliver operational leverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon is projected to have almost <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/amazon-testing-new-warehouse-robots-and-ai-tools-for-workers-8e3d885a?mod=article_inline\" rel=\"nofollow\">40 delivery fulfillment centers</a> equipped with robots by the end of next year, resulting in an estimated cost savings of $4 billion per year. A <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-robots-the-10-billion-cost-cutters-170059181.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morgan Stanley report</a> estimated that if 30% to 40% of Amazon’s orders in the U.S. are fulfilled through its next-gen warehouses by 2030, the company could save $10 billion a year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on last year’s financials, $10 billion in cost savings translates to an additional $170 billion in enterprise value. As the <em>Prof G Markets</em> team observed in our other newsletter, investors are “pricing in AWS’s dominance, but missing the retail margin story,” making Amazon one of the most underappreciated members of the Mag 7.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon’s shares are trading at 34x earnings, well below the company’s five-year average of 60x. The stock had been up around 2% so far this year, but it popped after this week’s earnings call on news that AWS revenue had beaten expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon shipping costs vs retail revenue\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Atoms &amp; Bits</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of technology’s tectonic unlocks has been the elevation of information (bits) over objects (atoms). Our digital lives are (mostly) frictionless. One-click purchasing, personalized algorithmic feeds, and swiping right put shopping, entertainment, and mating at our fingertips.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But in the physical world, friction is the defining feature. To fulfill a one-click purchase, Amazon deploys armies of human workers, leveraging machines, global supply chains, and infrastructure. Five companies in the Mag 7 primarily move bits. One, Tesla (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA\" title=\"Tesla, Inc.\">TSLA</a>), moves atoms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Straddling both worlds, Amazon is a logistics company at its core. With <a href=\"https://maxdispatchservice.com/amazon-fleet-stats/#:~:text=Amazon%20owns%20approximately%2040%2C000%20semi,30%2C000%20branded%20delivery%20vans%20worldwide.\" rel=\"nofollow\">40,000 semitrucks</a>, 30,000 vans, and 110 aircraft (equivalent to the <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/largest-air-forces-in-the-world\" rel=\"nofollow\">armed forces</a> of Austria, Denmark, or Norway), Amazon excels at moving atoms. The company delivers <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/29/amazon-says-60percent-of-prime-orders-are-arriving-same-day-or-next-day.html#:~:text=This%20is%20up%20from%20roughly%2050%25%20in,selection%20of%20top%2Dselling%20items%20in%20each%20city.\" rel=\"nofollow\">60% of Prime orders</a> on the same or next day. According to the most recent data, almost three-quarters of Americans live within one hour of an Amazon fulfillment center.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recently, I wrote that America’s economy is one big bet on AI. That bet has inflated the valuations of companies that move bits and distracted attention from companies using automation to reduce friction in the physical world. <a href=\"https://public.com/stocks/amzn\" rel=\"noopener\">Two-thirds of Amazon’s revenue</a> comes from three segments: online retail, physical stores, and fulfillment services for third-party sellers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Those business lines account for one-third of Amazon’s operating expenses - $26 billion in the last quarter alone. The more it automates, the more Amazon can cut costs in its core business by reducing real-world friction. It’s already happening.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/amazon-warehouse-robots-automation-942b814f?&amp;mod=article_inline\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Amazon averaged roughly 670 employees per facility last year - the lowest number in 16 years. Meanwhile, those employees now handle 22x as many packages, on average, as they did a decade ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon employees per facility\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>1 Million Robots (and Counting)</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This week, Amazon <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/27/amazon-to-announce-sweeping-corporate-job-cuts-starting-tuesday.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced plans</a> to lay off 30,000 corporate employees. That 10% reduction represents the largest cut to headcount in the company’s history, but it’s a fraction of what’s coming for warehouse workers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon’s U.S. workforce has increased 3x since 2018, to almost 1.2 million (70% of the company’s employees are based in the U.S.). But according to the <em>New York Times</em>, Amazon believes that by 2027 it can avoid hiring more than <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/technology/inside-amazons-plans-to-replace-workers-with-robots.html#:~:text=Amazon%27s%20U.S.%20work%20force%20has,packs%20and%20delivers%20to%20customers.\" rel=\"nofollow\">160,000 worker</a>s it would otherwise need in America. Ultimately, Amazon believes it can automate up to 75% of the company’s warehouse operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consider Amazon’s most recent automation milestone. In June, it deployed its <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/amazon-deploys-its-1-millionth-robot-in-a-sign-of-more-job-automation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">millionth robot worker</a>, putting the company on pace to have more robots than humans in its warehouses by year-end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that, just as Mark Zuckerberg, Satya Nadella, and Sundar Pichai dream of AI replacing high-priced tech talent at Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), and Alphabet, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy dreams of a robot workforce that will never unionize, get injured, demand a raise, go to the bathroom, take time off, or post about poor working conditions on social media.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At Amazon’s scale, it’s not a robot workforce, but a robot nation. One of the fears about AI is that it could build a robot army that turns on us. It’s here, it’s Amazon, and (so far) it’s not looking to kill us. It will replace a lot of us, though.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Operational industrial robots\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Convergence </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon began investing in robotics a decade ago, purchasing Kiva Systems for $775 million. Since then, Amazon has identified <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/technology/amazon-robotics-automation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">six categories of automation</a>: movement, manipulation, sorting, storage, identification and packing. A robot called Hercules moves heavy carts, while another, Pegasus, sorts and shuttles packed orders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A robotic arm called Sparrow, designed to replace human pickers, is capable of handling 200 million different products of varying sizes and weights. A new address labeler can label 3,000 packages per hour. In tests, Amazon says Sequoia, an automated inventory management system, can process packages 25% faster than its current management system at a quarter of the cost.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This year, Amazon plans to spend $100 billion to capture what Jassy called a “once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity,” adding that “the vast majority of that capex spend is on AI for AWS.” But investments in AI are paying dividends in robotics as the technologies converge.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a Citigroup <a href=\"https://ir.citi.com/gps/H558-XNr_iTlGa7Qq7H9AYb5ZT2W851WZdFgPNEDsBtSeTgp7JcaTdS_uBfLVLpwfMQYeB5O5TwV9YcIDGuGOMjE2luzQprf\" rel=\"nofollow\">report put it</a>, “AI is a huge upgrade to robotics,” allowing robots to see, move, talk, learn, and act. It’s the difference between a robot programmed to perform a task and one capable of doing any task within its physical constraints. If you’ve taken a Waymo, you’ve seen convergence firsthand — the car is a robot operated by an AI driver. At Amazon, the peanut-butter-and-chocolate combo of AI and robotics shows up in three ways:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>New products:</strong> Amazon is testing AI-enhanced robots that can cut open boxes, unpack the contents, and sort them into the correct bins.</li> <li> <strong>Faster development:</strong> Amazon deployed its newest robotic arm, Blue Jay, 3x faster than its predecessors by using AI to make virtual prototypes.</li> <li> <strong>Optimization:</strong> DeepFleet uses AI to coordinate the movement of robots across Amazon’s fulfillment network, improving robot fleet travel time by 10%.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Holy Unlock</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike other jobs, loading and unloading trucks is primarily done by humans even in the most automated warehouses. It’s the same story for last-mile delivery; Amazon’s goal is to deliver <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/31/amazon-resumes-drone-deliveries-after-two-month-pause.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">500 million packages</a> per year via drone by the end of the decade, but for now it relies on humans to deliver more than 6 billion packages annually.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is dangerous work, akin to playing <em>Tetris</em> with heavy weights, often in extreme heat or freezing cold. According to <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106413.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">BLS data</a>, transportation and warehouse workers sustain serious injuries at twice the rate of manufacturing workers and nearly 4x the rate of workers in mining, oil, and gas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last year, Tye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, described the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-new-robotic-warehouse-will-rely-heavily-on-human-workers-f95e06b6?mod=article_inline\" rel=\"nofollow\">tactile skills</a> and situational awareness needed to load and unload a truck as the “holy grail of robotics,” adding, “we aren’t there yet.” <em>We</em> is the operative word.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This year, DHL ordered <a href=\"https://www.therobotreport.com/dhl-buying-1000-stretch-robots-from-boston-dynamics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">1,000 robot truck loaders</a> from Boston Dynamics. Through its $1 billion Industrial Innovation Fund, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/05/rightbot-which-is-developing-robots-to-unload-freight-lands-investment-from-amazon/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon invested in Rightbot</a>, a startup that designs robot truck loaders. As soon as a robot truck loader comes online, it’ll connect with two other robot systems - Cardinal and Proteus - that sort packages and move them to the loading dock. When that happens, some of America’s most dangerous jobs will (mostly) vanish.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Robots vs. Humans</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Automation represents a massive wealth transfer from Amazon’s workers to its shareholders and customers.

I applauded the business for being a strong long-term performer, having found a solid balance between organic and inorganic growth, all combined<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> with solid long-term capital allocation skills.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following long-term gains seen by investors, valuation multiples have been on the increase as well, and the resulting earnings multiple in the low-thirties was a bit demanding, even as the long-term performance has been impressive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fast-forwarding half a year in time, shares trade rather flattish; in fact, they have been trading down a percent or two, while the market at large has seen double-digit share price gains.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Solving For Safer</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Motorola Solutions develops, builds, and creates technologies that allow for the protection of people, property, and places. Spun-off from Motorola in 2011, the company became a pure play on providing such solutions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Such technologies are, for instance, applied to video security, access controls, but also LMR communications and command centers. Applications in video security include fixed video security, in-car videos, body cameras. LMR is the definition of land mobile communications, in which Motorola provides such solutions for both public and private communication applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Command center applications include, for instance, 911 call center equipment. The extent of all these products is vast, including over 5 million fixed video cameras deployed, some 13,000 LMR networks installed, and over 3,600 911 call centers equipped with Motorola's equipment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company generates about $11 billion in annual sales, with some $7 billion in revenues stemming from products &amp; systems, complemented by software &amp; service, the latter being largely recurring revenues. In terms of segments, nearly $2 billion in sales are coming from video security, about $8 billion from mission-critical networks, and nearly a billion from command center revenues. About 70% of sales are tied to public safety and the remainder to enterprise clients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company claims to target more than $80 billion in total addressable markets, as the business has seen strong growth in recent years. Over the past decade, revenues have essentially doubled to nearly $11 billion in 2024, with non-GAAP operating margins rising no less than 10 points towards 30% of sales, aided by the faster growing software revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note that organic growth was combined with dozens of acquisitions over this period of time, coming at a combined purchase price in excess of $10 billion. Moreover, Motorola managed to buy back about one in every six shares over this period of time as well, with sales growth, margin expansion, and buybacks all helping to drive earnings per share growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this pushed up shares in a huge fashion, as well as a $70 stock in 2015 that peaked around the $500 mark in 2024, and after a period of relative stagnation this year, shares are down to $410 at this point in time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Perspectives</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In February of this year, Motorola reported an 8% increase in 2024 sales to $10.8 billion, with adjusted operating margins rising by a point to 29% of sales, allowing adjusted earnings to rise by some 16% to $13.84 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net debt of $4 billion just exceeded a $3.5 billion reported EBITDA number, yet a stock trading in the low $400s was trading around 30 times earnings. However, if one strips out stock-based compensation expenses, earnings trended closer to $12.50 per share, pushing up realistic earnings multiples towards 33 times earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company guided for 2025 sales to rise by some 5.5%, with adjusted earnings seen at a midpoint of $14.69 per share. Following a solid first quarter earnings report, Motorola announced a larger deal in May. Motorola reached a $4.4 billion deal to acquire LA-based Silvus Technologies, a transaction set to double net debt to $9 billion. With this deal, the company would acquire mobile ad-hoc technology, known as MANET, used for secure communication that no longer needs fixed networks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valued at 10 times sales, while Motorola traded around 7 times, the deal was expensive. However, the EBITDA margins of Silvus were reported some 13 points higher than Motorola, at around 45% of sales. With leverage ratios seen up to the mid-2s, and realistic earnings seen up to $13.00-$13.50 per share this year, multiples were still demanding in the low thirties, too high to see appeal for me here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Motorola closed the deal with Silvus in August, which meant that the acquisition made a partial contribution to the third quarter results, released by the end of October.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third quarter reported sales <a href=\"https://www.motorolasolutions.com/content/dam/msi/investors/doc_financials/2025/q3/msi_q3_2025_earnings_release_and_financial_tables.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">rose</a> by 8% to $3.01 billion, with product sales up 6% and software &amp; services sales up 11%. Adjusted margins rose by nearly another point to exceed 30% of sales here, with adjusted earnings up 9% to $4.06 per share. The backlog is up 3% on an annual basis to $14.6 billion, as growth in the backlog has been trailing reported revenue growth for a while now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net debt is reported at $8.5 billion, a bit lower than the pro forma numbers in May, driven by retained earnings, as leverage is not a major concern with leverage ratios in the mid-2s; in fact, these are down to 2.3 times based on trailing EBITDA reported here. Aided by a full contribution from Silvus in the fourth quarter, revenues are seen up 11% on the year in the final quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The midpoint of the full year adjusted earnings guidance is now set at $15.12, up fifteen cents from the previous guidance. With stock-based compensation expenses trending around $1.70 per share, realistic earnings are only seen around $13.50 per share, resulting in a 30 times realistic earnings multiple seen this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares fell some 5% on the back of these results, as they hit a high in the high $400s in recent weeks, as the market is not impressed by the guidance, also as the company trades at very demanding multiples here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">And Now?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With organic growth trending in the mid-single digits here, the bar is high in terms of expectations. Frankly, this has been casting a shadow over the shares so far this year, as I see no appeal here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the company continues to grow along just fine, and I like the bolt-on M&amp;A performed, I am hard-pressed to see appeal here, making me still very cautious to get involved with the shares here.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares remain a bit too pricey, even if appeal might be on the increase, as I look forward to continuing to update the thesis following continued share price stagnation and/or interesting buybacks.</p>",

This year, despite the inescapable return of bubble banter among the financial chattering class, the S&amp;P 500 has added 2.3 percent to its year-to-date price performance since the end of September.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Second Half Surge</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, much of the market’s giddiness in recent weeks has happened in that very same segment of mega-cap AI-themed stocks that has generated the lion’s share of the bubble chatter. It was not always thus. For the first half of the year, the so-called Magnificent Seven and its posse of AI fellow travelers didn’t stand out in any meaningful way from the rest of the market. The chart below shows the year-to-date relative performance of the S&amp;P 500 benchmark index, which is weighted by market capitalization and thus influenced in an outsize manner by the movements of the largest companies, and the S&amp;P 500 equal-weighted index (which, as the name suggests, takes away the influence of the market cap factor).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_chart_10_31_25.png?io=w640\" alt=\"S&amp;P 500 market cap vs. equal weight\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"892\" height=\"567\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_chart_10_31_25.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_chart_10_31_25.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_chart_10_31_25.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_chart_10_31_25.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_chart_10_31_25.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_chart_10_31_25.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_chart_10_31_25.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_chart_10_31_25.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The acceleration of the Big Tech-concentrated second-half surge was on prominent view this week. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 finished in positive territory largely thanks to just two names – Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) and Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) – while 75 percent of the companies in the index finished lower on the day, as did eight of the 11 main industry sectors. On Thursday, shares of Alphabet (Google’s parent company) jumped three percent even while the index itself lost nearly one percent as investors responded to a more hawkish than expected report from the Federal Open Market Committee the day before. This morning (Friday), Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) is up nearly 12 percent on the day following a blockbuster earnings report delivered after yesterday’s market close. Amazon’s strength, which has little to do with Prime shipments of Halloween tchotchkes and lots to do with robust demand for AI and cloud services from its AWS business segment, seems to be giving the AI optimist crowd an argument against the many recent concerns expressed about the apparent circularity of the AI ecosystem.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The End Is Nigh… Near… Never…</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s one thing to observe a bubble and proclaim its existence; it’s another thing entirely to predict how much longer the animal spirits have to run. After all, Alan Greenspan made his “irrational exuberance” comments about the building tech bubble in 1996, several years before the thing finally imploded in March 2000. The AI infrastructure bonanza does not appear to be on track to end any time soon. Among the tidbits to take away from this week’s earnings reports was the tidy sum of $80 billion in capital expenditures on AI-related items by just three companies – Microsoft, Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) and Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) – with much more than that promised for the year ahead. The build-out of data centers to power the large language models for AI software is increasingly a must-have component for GDP growth. According to a recent analysis by Harvard economist Jason Furman, investment in data centers and information processing technology accounted for virtually all the GDP growth for the first half of this year. As long as this multibillion-dollar spending frenzy occurs, it seems, the economy has a pretty solid cushion against falling into negative growth. Of course, when and if all this spending turns into real productivity across the economy is the question that will keep us all guessing for the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the bubble talk won’t be fading away any time soon. Keep an eye on that relative performance trend between the market cap and equal cap indexes, which is likely to look quite different on the other side of a bursting bubble.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://mvfinancial.com/news/mv-weekly-market-flash-big-tech-goes-into-overdrive-again/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

However, this does not mean I should doubt PVAL's potential as well, as its performance this year speaks for itself.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And even in a scenario with a valuation reset (a 28.8x weighted average Price/Earnings ratio of the S&amp;P 500 index does look quite elevated), as we can deduce from PVAL's past performance (cautiously, of course, as past returns guarantee nothing in the future), it should do much better than the market (an around 84% downside capture ratio is what I am referring to).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So now, let us delve into all the details and discuss what is so special about PVAL.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Basics of The Putnam Focused Large Cap Value ETF</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Inception: May 25, 2021</li> <li>Investment Manager: Putnam Investment Management, LLC</li> <li>Total Net Assets: $4.95 billion, as of October 30</li> <li>Net Expense Ratio: 0.56%</li> <li>3-Year Annualized Return (October 2022–September 2025): 23.04% vs. 24.9% of the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVV\" title=\"iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF\">IVV</a>) and 16.71% of the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWD\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF\">IWD</a>)</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">PVAL Strategy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we know from the Franklin Templeton <a href=\"https://www.franklintempleton.com/investments/options/exchange-traded-funds/products/39434/SINGLCLASS/putnam-focused-large-cap-value-etf/PVAL\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>, incepted in May 2021, PVAL is managed actively, seeking \"capital growth and current income.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As explained on page 2 of the summary prospectus, PVAL</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>...invests mainly in common stocks of U.S. companies, with a focus on value stocks that offer the potential for capital growth, current income, or both.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From the exact same page, we know that large-cap companies are defined as those \"...of a size similar to those in the Russell 1000 Value Index.\" And this index is PVAL's benchmark, as per the factsheet. However, it is also added that the ETF can venture into the mid-size universe as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As to the valuation characteristics, Putnam Investment Management, LLC, the ETF's investment manager, decides whether a company is \"...currently undervalued by the market\" or not.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">PVAL Is An Active Nontransparent ETF</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When assessing PVAL, investors should pay close attention to the fact that this vehicle is nontransparent. In practice, this means that the ETF publishes its detailed portfolio monthly and not daily.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of writing this article, the most recent portfolio available on the PVAL website was as of September 30, 2025. And even though the tracking basket is released on each business day, I should remind you that securities inside it are not what the fund actually holds (there should be an overlap though).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So being an ANT ETF has essentially two sides.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>On the one hand, it is quite beneficial, as traders who have strategies based on copying funds' most promising ideas (the result can be these funds' top ideas failing, which is not pleasant) have close to zero chances here (alas, not zero).</li> <li>On the other hand, a few quite sensitive issues arise.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For instance, as explained by PVAL:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>You may have to pay more money to trade the ETF's shares. This ETF will provide less information to traders, who tend to charge more for trades when they have less information.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More details on risks and disadvantages can be found in the prospectus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Obviously, as I have already explained in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829323-tdvg-solid-dividend-growth-but-low-yield-mixed-returns-hold\">article</a> on the T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TDVG\" title=\"T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth ETF\">TDVG</a>), the ANT approach creates understandable challenges for ETF researchers, as they simply have no up-to-date holdings to analyze and thus have to make certain compromises.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The solution I use in my articles on the ANT vehicles is that I take the most recent financial metrics (today, the data I am using is as of October 31) and pair them with the most recent portfolio available. Thus, we can get a general understanding of an ETF's factor mix, but of course it is far from perfect. This is what we will be doing today.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">PVAL Portfolio Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of September 30, PVAL had a portfolio of 46 holdings, 45 of them being equities and one being quite a significant cash position with a 2.62% weight. Citigroup Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/C\" title=\"Citigroup Inc.\">C</a>) was the top name, with a 4.18% weight. Here, I should note that at least as of September, the ETF was quite bullish on the financial sector overall, with a 20.13% allocation, which makes it more of a contrarian play compared to IVV, which is enamored of IT.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-1761955559107831.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ETFs comparison\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"563\" height=\"359\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-1761955559107831.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-1761955559107831.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-1761955559107831.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-1761955559107831.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-1761955559107831.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-1761955559107831.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-1761955559107831.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-1761955559107831.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Weights as of October 30 for IWD and IVV and September 30 for PVAL <span>(Created by the author using data from the ETFs and Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Compared to IWD, the ETF that tracks its benchmark, PVAL is underweight in six sectors, the key two among them being communication and real estate.

However, its adjusted weighted average earnings yield is the highest compared to those of IWD and IVV, while EV/EBITDA and Price/Sales are the lowest.</li> <li>It is a bit growthier than IWD, as illustrated by the weighted average forward growth rates.</li> <li>Nevertheless, compared to the Russell 1000 Value ETF, it has a slightly smaller exposure to stocks with a B- Quant Profitability grade or higher. At the same time, its return on total capital and return on assets are stronger.</li> <li>IVV looks mostly stronger than PVAL, but it is also meaningfully more expensive.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Is So Special About PVAL's Performance?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a lot to appreciate about PVAL's performance. Put shortly, it has outperformed IVV and IWD (the ETF that tracks its benchmark) since inception, delivered excellent results compared to the Large Value subclass, and has demonstrated fairly healthy risk characteristics.

Japan, a major export economy, is especially exposed.

In the decade since that merger, SmartCentres has diversified to include residential, including condos, townhomes, apartments, and self-storage. The REIT owns 35 million square feet of income producing properties and 3,500 acres of land. SmartCentres is advancing an ambitious development pipeline of 86 million square feet of mixed-use developments. SmartCentres trades at 13.5X trailing AFFO, in line with its historical range.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Operations </span></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a reflection of the REIT's high-quality tenant mix, SmartCentres has a long track record of industry-leading occupancy levels.

The REIT's ability to execute its densification option will be highly correlated to its balance sheet flexibility to execute large projects. For a close look at SmartCentres densification strategy, see my previous coverage: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4602129-smartcentres-reit-smart-value-creation-through-intensification\">SmartCentres REIT: Smart Value Creation Through Intensification</a></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Distribution</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SmartCentres has paid a distribution for 22 consecutive years. During this period, the REIT has reliably and consistently paid unit holders. At current unit prices, the annualized payout of $1.85 per unit offers unitholders a 6.8% distribution yield. SmartCentres current yield is slightly below its 4-year average yield of 7.13%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SmartCentres has a trailing twelve month FFO payout ratio of 77.7% and a trailing twelve-month AFFO payout ratio of 95.8%. The REIT’s forward AFFO payout ratio of 93.2% indicates improving cash flow available for distribution. I mention both FFO and AFFO because they provide different information. As a standardized metric, FFO is helpful to compare between different REITs. AFFO is the more useful indicator of how much cash is really available for distribution. At current levels, SmartCentres is paying out essentially all of its distributable income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This monthly distribution of $0.15417 per unit has been flat since October 2019. While I always prefer to see a distribution that increases with the pace of inflation, in the retail REITs space, it is notable that SmartCentres has managed to maintain its distribution. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Crombie REIT (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRR.UN:CA\" title=\"Crombie Real Estate Investment Trust\">CRR.UN:CA</a>) and RioCan REIT (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/REI.UN:CA\" title=\"RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust\">REI.UN:CA</a>) both slashed their distributions. While Crombie has resumed their payments at pre-COVID levels, RioCan’s distribution is still below its 2020 levels. Despite not being in a position to raise its distribution in recent years, SmartCentres has prudently managed their distribution levels to avoid a cut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"836\" data-height=\"436\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SmartCentres Distribution History\" width=\"640\" height=\"334\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">SmartCentres Distribution History <span>(SmartCentres Investor Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SmartCentres has tended to focus on its distribution as the primary mechanism of returning capital to shareholders. The REIT hasn’t initiated a unit buyback program since the expiry of its normal course issuer bid in 2022.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the last two decades, the overhanging headline risk for retail REITs has been the tendency for online retail to supplant the need for brick and mortar square footage. While online retail growth continues, REITs including SmartCentres have adjusted their portfolio mixes to be more defensive to these pressures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at Walmart, for example, the company has made itself indispensable for in-person retail through investments in its grocery and DIY business lines. Serving as both in person retail experiences and fulfilment centres for grocery delivery, Walmart has leveraged its brick-and-mortar footprint. Shares of Walmart are up 27% over the last 12 months, compared to 21% for Amazon, a fully online retailer. In addition to Walmart, other major tenants include grocers like Loblaw Cos. Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/L:CA\" title=\"Loblaw Companies Limited\">L:CA</a>) and Sobeys Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EMP.A:CA\" title=\"Empire Company Limited\">EMP.A:CA</a>), as well established retailers Dollarama Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOL:CA\" title=\"Dollarama Inc.\">DOL:CA</a>), TJX Companies Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TJX\" title=\"The TJX Companies, Inc.\">TJX</a>), and Canadian Tire Corp. Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTC:CA\" title=\"Canadian Tire Corporation, Limited\">CTC:CA</a>). These creditworthy tenants offer stability and defensiveness to the REIT's occupancy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At 23% of revenue, the concentration in leased space to Walmart presents some revenue diversification risk; however, I see the quality of revenue here as outweighing the concentration risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-17615397976809425.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SmartCentres Tenant Mix\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"420\" height=\"438\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-17615397976809425.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-17615397976809425.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-17615397976809425.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-17615397976809425.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-17615397976809425.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-17615397976809425.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-17615397976809425.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-17615397976809425.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">SmartCentres Tenant Mix <span>(SmartCentres Investor Presentation )</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance Sheet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SmartCentres has approximately $1.15B in <a href=\"https://smartcentres.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Q2-2025-MDA.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">available</a> liquidity including $875M available on its operating facility and an additional $250M accordion facility.

SmartCentres debt carries a weighted average term to maturity of 3.1 years with a weighted average interest rate of 3.94%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Canadian retail REIT sector has been a destination for capital investment in the last year.

While the REIT has reasonable liquidity and has been successful in raising debt when needed, its leverage is at the high end of the sector average and may limit the capacity and magnitude of development plans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my previous <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4602129-smartcentres-reit-smart-value-creation-through-intensification\">coverage</a> of SmartCentres in May 2023, I rated the REIT a <strong>buy</strong> on its growth potential and high-quality property base. While I continue to see SmartCentres as the highest quality operator in the Canadian retail REIT space, I am downgrading the REIT to a <strong>hold</strong> on its slow progress in deleveraging and stagnant distribution yield. While income-focused investors could add SmartCentres at current levels, unit price appreciation is likely to remain tepid as the REIT's growth is financed through debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While SmartCentres is a high-quality REIT offering attractive income, its elevated leverage is a concern. I would prefer to see SmartCentres prioritize deleveraging with the proceeds of any divestments. The REIT's high AFFO payout ratio makes it unlikely the distribution will be increased in the near term. SmartCentres 6.9% distribution yield is backed by quality cash flow and supported by a 22-year record of uninterrupted distribution payments.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking Ahead</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SmartCentres is set to release its Q3 results on Wednesday, November 12, 2025. Investors will want to look for updates on the REIT's capital recycling program and how proceeds will be deployed to maximize unitholder value. Income seekers can also look for signs of an improving payout ratio that would give line of sight to the prospect of resuming distribution increases.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

As generative AI models grow more capable and associated hardware becomes cheaper and more versatile, we’re rapidly advancing into the era of physical AI, where networks of machines can think, see, move, and act in real time to augment human workflows.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This shift carries profound implications. Human labor productivity could be supercharged as people increasingly deploy robots for physical tasks. Entirely new use cases will emerge across sectors such as last-mile logistics, self-driving, and robotic manufacturing. Ultimately, this could culminate in Humanoid systems advancing, as general-purpose physical AI brings intelligent automation to everyday businesses and households. In our view, Robotics &amp; Physical AI form a defining theme of the intelligence age. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Manufacturing’s Automation Shift Is Now an Economic Imperative</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Manufacturing has long been central to robotics adoption. Global stock of industrial robots already totals roughly 4.7 million, offering automation a healthy installed base into a core sector of the economy.<sup>1</sup> That adoption is expected to further accelerate as new priorities such as reshoring and reindustrialization take shape in strategic industries such as semiconductors and electric vehicle (EV) components.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2024, new global industrial robot installations reached 542,000 units, more than doubling over the past decade and marking the second-highest annual installation count of industrial robots in history.<sup>2</sup> Asia accounted for 74% of new deployments, compared with 16% in Europe and 9% in the Americas. Annual installations are projected to rise another 6% in 2025 and surpass 700,000 units by 2028, underscoring automation’s steady advance.<sup> 3</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Falling automation costs and rising labor expenses further reinforce the structural global reshoring shift. Average U.S. hourly manufacturing wages reached $34 in 2025, and are expected to rise to $39 by decades end.<sup>4</sup> Meanwhile, the average cost of an industrial robot is expected to continue to compress, while functionalities improve.<sup>5</sup> These dynamics enable a greater quantity and flexibility of robotic systems to operate in a wider range of settings, shifting the economic advantage in favor of automation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Robots are also getting smarter and more flexible due to AI. Rather than the rigid, fixed setups of the past, software-defined robot platforms with standardized interfaces enable plug-and-play adaptation. This modularization reduces downtime, supports reconfiguration, and lowers integration risk. In effect, companies get the economics of mass customization. Continuous improvements in algorithms, semiconductor efficiency, and power systems are accelerating this shift.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Collaborative robots, or cobots, are also expanding the frontier of industrial automation. Designed to work safely alongside humans, they take on hazardous, repetitive, or precision tasks at a fraction of the cost, allowing workers to focus on higher-value activities such as design, supervision, and decision-making.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"3651\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251010 - Charting Disruption_01-0.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"701\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Robotics Is Advancing Rapidly Across Services</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Improving intelligence is helping Robotics move rapidly beyond factory floors into the everyday economy, such as warehouses, hospitals, delivery networks, and retail spaces. These segments face chronic labor shortages, high turnover, and rising expectations for speed and precision, creating ideal conditions for automation to thrive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In logistics, autonomous mobile robots now manage everything from pallet movement to last-mile sorting. Amazon alone operates over one million warehouse robots worldwide by using fleets like Proteus and Sparrow to transport and identify packages with minimal human input.<sup>6</sup> Walmart, FedEx, and DHL are also integrating robotics to stabilize throughput and protect against labor volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In healthcare, surgical robots are transforming the operating room by enhancing precision, reducing recovery times, and expanding access to complex procedures. In 2025, it’s estimated that roughly 50% of surgeons perform some type of general robotics surgery, up from just 9% in 2012.<sup>7</sup> Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci installed robot base has nearly doubled in the last five years, reaching 10,488 installed units in June 2025.<sup>8</sup> Beyond the operating room, hospitals use autonomous systems for medication delivery, sanitation, and patient mobility support, freeing up nurses and technicians to focus on direct care.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In retail, robots increasingly monitor shelf inventory, restocking items, and cleaning aisles. In hospitality, autonomous butlers and delivery bots are increasingly common in hotels across Asia and the U.S., handling room service and concierge logistics. The food industry has begun to implement automated kitchen arms that assemble burgers, brew coffee, and mix drinks with precision and consistency. And in transportation, autonomous robotaxis and delivery pods travel city streets, building toward a future where goods and people move seamlessly through networks of intelligent machines. Since launching its commercial service in 2018, Waymo now handles over 250,000 driverless trips across five major U.S. cities.<sup>9</sup></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Evolution of Physical AI Culminates in Humanoid Development</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.globalxetfs.com/articles/the-rise-of-humanoids-explained\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer noopener\">Humanoid robots</a> are emerging as the next major frontier in physical automation, bridging the gap between industrial machinery and intelligent, adaptive assistants designed for human environments. Unlike traditional factory robots, which are fixed and specialized, humanoids walk, see, manipulate objects, and communicate naturally. They’re designed for the spaces people already inhabit, such as warehouses, hospitals, offices, and eventually homes, giving them enormous potential to address global labor shortages, support aging populations, and unlock new forms of productivity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market opportunity is vast. Humanoid adoption could touch roughly one-third of industrial labor roles and up to 15% of global households by the mid-2030s, translating to nearly $5 trillion in total economic potential.<sup>10</sup> Pilots for early prototypes, such as Agility Robotics’ Digit and Figure’s humanoid models, are already underway in logistics and manufacturing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By 2030, it’s estimated that global annual humanoid sales could reach 1 million, just 17 years after commercial humanoid sales began. By 2040, cumulative humanoid unit sales could potentially reach 400 million.<sup>11</sup> Such a trajectory would closely parallel the early expansion of the automobile industry, which similarly took about 17 years to progress from initial commercialization to 1 million units sold.<sup>12</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"4584\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251010 - Charting Disruption_02-1.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"880\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Physical Intelligence Starts to Make Its Mark</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The rise of Robotics and Physical AI marks a structural transformation in the global economy, as intelligence extends from the digital realm into the physical world. Automation that once centered on manufacturing is now advancing across a wide range of industries, improving productivity, precision, and scalability. As humanoid and autonomous systems evolve, they will increasingly bridge the gap between industrial capability and human adaptability. Collectively, these developments position Robotics and Physical AI as a defining investment theme of the intelligence age – one with the potential to reshape productivity, open new markets, and drive long-term economic growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>IFR.
