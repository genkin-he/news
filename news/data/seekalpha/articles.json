The air taxi company has pushed the service as a future opportunity towards the end of the decade with the potential to remove the cost of the pilot from a flight and add another paying passenger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Joby Aviation just <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509805-joby-aviation-shares-soar-after-teaming-up-with-nvidia-to-advance-autonomous-flight-tech\">announced plans</a> to work with <strong>Nvidia</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) on the development of autonomous flight technology using their IGX Thor compute platform integrated into \"Superpilot\" technology for civil and military platforms. The collaboration promoted the concept of accelerating autonomous aviation without providing any concrete plans or goals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The eVTOL partner is listed as the only aviation launch partner, but Nvidia already works with tons of companies working on autonomous vehicles. The AI compute giant is focused on platforms that can be widely adopted, not restrictive partnerships.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Besides, Joby Aviation <a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/joby-acquires-xwing-autonomy-division/\" rel=\"nofollow\">bought</a> Xwing last year to acquire the Superpilot software to advance autonomous flying plans. Xwing had already completed 250 fully autonomous flights and more than 500 auto-landings prior to the deal, which was over a year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the start of September, Joby Aviation <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4491703-joby-aviation-remotely-pilots-cessna-in-pentagon-push-for-autonomous-aircraft\">remotely piloted</a> a Cessna 208 aircraft. The company logged over 7,000 miles in the demonstration test, though the flights were remotely piloted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, Joby Aviation shouldn't rally based on autonomous plans. The company must obtain FAA certification and successfully launch an air taxi service in New York by manufacturing certified aircraft before autonomous flying turns into a focus.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Focus On eVTOL Certification</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The vastly more important story for Joby Aviation is the plans to fly piloted tests on Type Inspection Authorization (TIA) aircraft. At the time of the Q2 earnings call in August, the aircraft manufacturer was working on completing the assembly of the first of 5 aircraft to be used in FAA certification testing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Joby Aviation will report Q3 earnings on November 5 and the whole focus will be on aircraft certification, not autonomous flights. About 3 months ago, the company had reached 70% certification of Stage 4 testing with some progress on Stage 5.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1526\" data-height=\"588\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"247\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Joby Aviation Q3'25 shareholder letter</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4809921-joby-aviation-inc-joby-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q2'25 earnings call</a>, the CEO outlined the flight testing plan as follows:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>During this stage, Joby and FAA pilots will fly our aircraft to validate all of our certification work ahead of receiving a type certification. And I'm pleased to say, as we announced this morning, the first of 5 aircraft for TIA flight testing is headed to final assembly, and we remain on track to <em>start flying our TIA aircraft with Joby pilots this year and to begin TIA certification flights with FAA pilots early next year.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Along with the announced deal with RAKTA in the UAE, Joby Aviation released that flight testing had topped 40,000 miles. The company should've logged far more test miles over the last month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company recently <a href=\"https://ir.jobyaviation.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/152/joby-aviation-announces-closing-of-underwritten-offering-of\" rel=\"nofollow\">raised another $591 </a><span>million</span> by selling 35 million shares at $16.85 per share. Joby Aviation pushed the pro-forma Q3 ending cash balance of around $1.5 billion. The company ended Q2 with a cash hoard of $991 million, and the company likely burned $120+ million during the last quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock has now seen the market cap reach $15 billion. Joby Aviation bought Blade Air Mobility's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4477164-joby-confirms-buying-blades-urban-air-mobility-passenger-business-for-125m\">passenger business</a> in the last quarter with a revenue run rate in the $105 million range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Joby Aviation won't report any eVTOL revenues for a few more quarters, at least. The UAM business from Blade won't change the valuation equation much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is still years away from being a $1+ billion business worthy of a $15 billion market cap. The stock continues to struggle moving above the $17 to $20 range due to stretched valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key investor takeaway is that Joby Aviation is leading the push into air taxi services around the globe. The company is on the verge of final testing with the FAA for aircraft certification, but the business has a long path to material revenues.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors should avoid buying the stock up here and possibly lock in some profits with the potential to re-acquire shares at lower prices.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UUUU\" title=\"Energy Fuels Inc.\">UUUU</a></span>) is a Colorado-based, leading U.S. mining company focused on the extraction, development, and sale of Uranium. The company is the largest provider of U.S. uranium. Energy Fuels is in the process of diversifying its operations by<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> expanding into new products, including other rare earth materials, and medical isotopes, as part of a strategy to capitalise on the growing demand for these critical materials.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With its controlling position in the uranium market and ongoing diversification efforts, Energy Fuels has seen its share price rocket over the course of the past year. This article will explore the factors behind this explosive growth and dive into the outlook of the company ahead of its earnings report.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Rating Snapshot</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Energy Fuels offers the potential for long-term upside but is dependent on rising uranium prices, increased production efficiency, and the success of their expansion into other business lines. Their upcoming earnings will be a key checkpoint on how the company is progressing in these areas. However, current revenue contribution is minimal during their inventory build-up and diversification efforts. This makes forecasting difficult, as returns are largely based upon the price of uranium, which is hard to predict due to its illiquid and politically sensitive nature. Given the uncertainties, I view Energy Fuels as a hold - strong potential, but has to back up its ambitious production targets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Company Overview</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Energy Fuels is currently in a period of strategic inventory retention, where instead of selling, they are opting to hold the majority of their produced uranium. This puts Energy Fuels in a position to capitalise if - as they predict - market prices strengthen. This approach reflects a deliberate strategy to maximise long-term value, even if at the expense of short-term revenue. By operating with this unique strategy, Energy Fuels experiences virtually no sales, rendering many of the traditional valuation measures useless. So how can investors interpret their upcoming earnings?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The focus instead should shift to other key areas that reveal the company’s underlying performance: Production metrics, which indicate operational progress; cash and liquidity, which show the level of financial stability during this holding period; and the performance of strategic investments, particularly in rare earths, and medical isotopes, which represent Energy Fuels next phase of growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Production Metrics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Arguably the most important factor that will determine the outcome of earnings is the production metrics. In the first half of the year, <a href=\"https://investors.energyfuels.com/2025-08-06-Energy-Fuels-Announces-Q2-2025-Results\" rel=\"noopener\">Energy Fuels produced</a> ~330,000 pounds of uranium, and set guidance of a total mining of 875,000 to 1,435,000 pounds for the entirety of 2025, so anything greater than ~350,000 pounds would signal strong operational momentum. In combination with further guidance refining this previous production estimate, we will get a clear idea on whether Energy Fuels is in a good position to deliver toward the upper end of expectations or if momentum has tapered off. Equally important are the production costs, previous guidance from management <a href=\"https://investors.energyfuels.com/2025-08-06-Energy-Fuels-Announces-Q2-2025-Results\" rel=\"nofollow\">forecast production costs</a> of uranium to drop to $23 - $30/Ib by Q4, down from an average of $53/Ib for existing inventory. Getting closer towards this target region would significantly strengthen future profitability. These key factors are expected to be the main focus of earnings for investors and will determine Energy Fuels ability to justify its recent share price performance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash and Liquidity</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q2, Energy Fuels operated with a debt-free balance sheet, however, this position is subject to significant change following the $700 million convertible senior notes offering, which was upsized from an initial $500 million – a sign of market confidence in the company's long term strategy. These were issued at a modest 0.75% coupon through 2031 with favourable conversion terms, giving Energy Fuels access to low cost capital without immediate dilution. Proceeds will improve Energy Fuels liquidity, giving them flexibility to continue to advance their key growth initiatives, whilst maintaining solid financial support during periods of market volatility. For interpreting upcoming earnings, the focus should be on how effectively this fresh capital is being allocated, not short-term profitability. There should be a particular focus on the investment of this capital into value driving projects and on sustaining strong cash reserves during this strategic inventory holding phase.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strategic Investments Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Energy Fuels diversification strategy is beginning to take shape across its rare earth and medical isotope segments, each offering the company future growth prospects beyond uranium. In rare earths, the company is continuing to gather momentum at their White Mesa Mill facility, producing high purity mixed rare earth carbonate and light earth oxides. Investors should watch for updates on operational scale and efficiency, particularly any progress comments made on their production facilities. On top of this, any contract announcements would show signs of Energy Fuels commercial readiness and begin to reveal what we can expect from them in the upcoming years. Another key update could come surrounding the development of medical isotopes - used in cancer therapies - which could open up another valuable revenue stream. Both the rare earths and medical isotopes demonstrate a large degree of potential to strengthen Energy Fuels positioning as a diversified critical materials supplier.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Analyst Consensus</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Energy Fuels is a small-cap company with limited analyst coverage, current projections provide useful context for expectations. Analysts covering Energy Fuels have an average <a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/UUUU/analysis/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">price target</a> of around $22, approximately 10% above the current share price. This suggests the market is cautiously optimistic, reflecting potential upside from uranium price appreciation and the company’s strategic diversification into rare earths and medical isotopes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given Energy Fuels inventory retention strategy, near-term revenue may be muted, so analysts are likely emphasizing operational execution, cost efficiency, and progress in diversification initiatives over short-term earnings. Any updates on uranium production volumes, mill throughput, or rare earth and isotope development could influence market sentiment and price performance relative to consensus targets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Uranium</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we covered, uranium remains the main component of Energy Fuels, so the company’s share price is naturally closely tied to the spot price of uranium. What, then, does the future look like for this commodity?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, uranium is sitting at around $80/Ib with analysts forecasting <a href=\"https://www.devere-group.com/uranium-price-forecast-to-rise-in-2025-amid-nuclear-game-changer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">potential rises</a> to $90-$100/Ib in the near term. The key reason for this projected price rise is the increase in demand for uranium over the coming years. This is coming from the U.S. government's push for nuclear energy, where the Department of Energy (DOE) is expanding its uranium reserve; Global reactor restarts, where demand for uranium reactors is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/uranium-demand-set-surge-28-by-2030-nuclear-power-gains-momentum-wna-says-2025-09-05/\" rel=\"nofollow\">expected to grow</a> ~28% by 2030 and more than double by 2040; ESG / clean energy narrative, as nuclear power is increasingly viewed as a low-carbon, reliable complement to renewables, making it more attractive in the clean energy transition.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Uranium Spot Price vs Share Price</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The graph below shows a strong correlation between the spot price of uranium and the share price of Energy Fuels, where they have followed a nearly identical path up until recently, when Energy Fuels share price has shot up relative to uranium. So what is driving this disconnect?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"752\" data-height=\"452\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Strong correlation between uranium spot price and Energy Fuel Inc Share Price\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Excel</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data from Cameco &amp; Yahoo Finance</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see <strong>3 key factors</strong> contributing to this deviation from the spot price:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Import bans: In recent years a large share of uranium imports into the U.S. have come from Russia, but, a recent legislation passed in the U.S. is banning all low-enriched uranium imports from Russia. This rule is currently being implemented and is planned to be fully phased in by 2028. This shrinking of supply will naturally increase the price of uranium for U.S. based operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Diversification: Energy Fuels plans to move into the rare earth elements space as well as the medical isotopes industry over the next couple of years, which opens up greater revenue streams for Energy Fuels while limiting their exposure to fluctuations in the price of uranium. We can expect to see their uranium revenue share begin to drop over the next few years, and investors are willing to pay a premium for this reduction in risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Debt issuance: Finally, as discussed earlier in the article, Energy Fuels recently raised $700 million through a convertible senior notes offering with interest at 0.75%, giving Energy Fuels capital to expand at a cheap rate. Initially, Energy Fuel aimed to raise $500 million, but due to large demand, the offering quickly raised to $600 million and then ultimately $700 million, signaling strong investor demand and confidence in the firm's outlook. Energy Fuel also used a portion of these proceeds to enter a capped call transaction, designed to mitigate potential share dilution should the share price increase significantly. This type of hedge shows strong financial management and reinforces the reputation amongst investors as a company that prioritises shareholder protection.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Energy Fuels is well-positioned as a leading U.S. uranium producer with early-stage diversification into rare earths and medical isotopes. Their strategic inventory retention and their shrinking production cost provide upside if uranium prices rise, while recent capital inflows improve their financial flexibility. However, near-term revenue may remain slight, and growth from diversification is still in early stages. Overall, the company offers long-term growth potential but remains execution and commodity-price dependent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, the company is a wait-and-see; they have set some pretty ambitious production quantity and price targets, which, if they hit, would be huge for the company. However, if they fall short, investors may begin to lose faith in the company - especially considering their limited sales - triggering a sell-off. To sum up, these earnings could swing the company either way to a pretty significant degree. It is a classic high-risk, high-reward speculation-based investment at the moment.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me know your thoughts ahead of earnings on Monday!</p>",

However, one by one those risks<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> were navigated, and a positive outlook has emerged, for now.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The US and China have agreed on some key points of a potential trade deal, averting what markets feared may spiral into a new cold war of sorts. The meeting between Trump and Xi Jinping did deliver an outcome, and one that was cheered by market participants.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The question now is, will the deal hold and be built upon, or will we get another flare-up in a few weeks/months?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next up we had the Federal Reserve meeting, which caught market participants by surprise. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell remains defiant and struck a rather hawkish tone to accompany the expected 25 bps rate cut. Stephen Miran, of course, voted for a 50 bps cut, while one Fed member voted for no rate cut at all.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another sign of the conflicting ideas between policymakers and challenges for the Fed moving forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly we can talk about earnings season, where the ‘magnificent 7’ companies all provided positive earnings reports and outlooks, which has kept the AI boom, well, booming.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On Friday, Amazon's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) shares jumped by 10.6% to a new record high after the online retailer predicted higher quarterly sales than analysts expected, boosted by its cloud division reporting its fastest revenue growth in almost three years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, Apple's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>) forecast for iPhone sales in the holiday quarter was better than Wall Street predicted, but its CEO, Tim Cook, warned about ongoing supply limitations; the company's stock remained flat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) rose 1.6% after its CEO, Jensen Huang, expressed hope that the company's most advanced Blackwell chips could be sold in China, building on the momentum that made Nvidia the first publicly listed company to exceed $5 trillion in market value earlier in the week.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How have the US Dollar and FX Performed?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The US dollar benefitted from the hawkish outlook by the Federal Reserve, which led to the USD rising to a two-month high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at Friday, the Japanese yen is heading for its worst monthly loss since July against the US dollar. This happened because the Bank of Japan disappointed traders who were hoping for clearer hints about future interest rate increases, while the US Federal Reserve also lowered expectations for a rate cut in December.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the yen fell, the US Dollar Index rose 0.35% and is set for its best month since July, with a 2% gain. Meanwhile, the euro dropped 0.37% after the European Central Bank kept its interest rates steady and stated that policy was in a \"good place.\" The euro has now lost 1.8% this month due to the dollar's broad strength.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the British pound fell to its lowest point since April against the dollar and hit its weakest point against the euro since May 2023 due to increasing political pressure on British Finance Minister Rachel Reeves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_2025-10-31_20_22_49-Greenshot.width-1400.png?io=w640\" alt=\"US Dollar and FX Performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"904\" height=\"554\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_2025-10-31_20_22_49-Greenshot.width-1400.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_2025-10-31_20_22_49-Greenshot.width-1400.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_2025-10-31_20_22_49-Greenshot.width-1400.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_2025-10-31_20_22_49-Greenshot.width-1400.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_2025-10-31_20_22_49-Greenshot.width-1400.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_2025-10-31_20_22_49-Greenshot.width-1400.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_2025-10-31_20_22_49-Greenshot.width-1400.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_2025-10-31_20_22_49-Greenshot.width-1400.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: OANDA Labs</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Week Ahead</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The week ahead will not be as busy as the one just concluded, but there are still some high-impact data releases and geopolitical risk. Beyond the data, markets will keep a close eye on Russia-Ukraine as well as a potential move by the US in Venezuela.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">President Trump on Friday pushed back on reports that he had given the green light for the US to conduct strikes on Venezuelan soil. If such a move does materialize or if the situation escalates, we could see a rise in risk premium once more just as it appeared to be subsiding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">US earnings will also be key as more companies are scheduled to report next week.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Asia Pacific Markets</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Reserve Bank of Australia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RBA\" title=\"RB Global, Inc.\">RBA</a>) is expected to keep its interest rates unchanged on Tuesday. This is because the inflation rate for the third quarter was higher than predicted and above the central bank's 2.5% target.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This high inflation will likely be the deciding factor, outweighing the unexpected increase in the unemployment rate in September, especially since other job market indicators still show overall strength in employment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at China, the meeting between Presidents Xi and Trump last week successfully reduced the trade tensions between the two countries. Next week should be quieter in terms of major news from China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main economic report will be the trade data released on Friday. We predict that China's export growth will slow down to 4.0% compared to last year, and import growth will also drop slightly to 3.2%. This slower pace for both exports and imports is expected to cause China's trade surplus (how much more it exports than imports) to jump back up to $101 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, we move to Japan, where, based on current projections, Japanese workers are expected to see their earnings and household spending increase. This suggests that consumer spending remains stable, even though inflation is high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong results from recent wage negotiations are likely to keep pushing wages higher, and the ongoing rally in the stock and asset markets could also encourage households to spend more.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>US Government Shutdown Continues, BoE Decision and Inflation in Focus</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the US government shutdown shows no sign of ending, we will have very little official economic data. However, the business and consumer surveys we do get are expected to confirm that the economy is slowing down. Key business reports (like the ISM indicators) suggest the economy is now growing at about 1-2%, which is decent but slower than the 2-3% growth seen recently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because the official jobs report is unavailable, the private ADP employment report has become extremely important. This report has shown that the private sector has cut jobs in three of the last four months, and we expect only a small gain of about 40,000 this month - a number that doesn't signal a recovery, especially after major job cuts announced by companies like Amazon and UPS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the University of Michigan confidence index will likely confirm that consumer confidence is weak due to worries about tariff-related price hikes and job security, meaning that spending by middle and lower-income families will likely continue to lag behind that of wealthier households.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Across the pond in the UK, stronger recent data on inflation and wages has brought back the possibility that the Bank of England might cut interest rates in November, although I still believe this is unlikely. The decision could be close, potentially a 5-4 vote in favor of keeping rates unchanged, with some members possibly voting for a much larger, 0.50% cut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't expect the bank to give any strong hint about a December cut, as they will want to review the government's late-November Autumn Budget first.

Recall that CVRP is a variable distribution MLP that pays quarterly distributions based on available cash. Over the life of the partnership, these have fluctuated from zero to over $10. The partnership's two plants ran about as expected during <a href=\"https://s206.q4cdn.com/964924026/files/doc_news/CVR-Partners-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Results-2025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q3 2025</a>, with utilization at 95%. Pricing turned out much better than I expected for UAN at $348 per ton, while ammonia came in a little light at $531. As a result, CVRP declared a distribution a bit better than I expected at $4.02. This could have been even higher, but the partnership built some inventory of both UAN and ammonia, which would have generated about $9 million of revenue in Q3. This product can now be sold in Q4 at likely higher prices during the maintenance turnaround at the Coffeyville plant. To partially offset the lower sales in Q3, CVRP released some of its operating reserves, which is cash set aside to smooth out these swings in earnings. The partnership released $6 million in Q3 of the $8 million they reserved earlier.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The outlook for demand and pricing is strong in Q4 and the first half of 2026, according to management on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835615-cvr-partners-lp-common-units-uan-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a>. I now estimate this will produce a forward distribution yield in the high teens percent range, up significantly from the forecast of slightly over 10% in last quarter's article. Still, the unit price does not seem to be moving, even with this better outlook. Perhaps investors remember the lean times of the late 2010s when distributions were zero and the unit price fell below $10 (even adjusted for a 1:10 reverse split).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761923364883507_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1350\" data-height=\"1003\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761923364883507_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CVR Partners distribution history\" width=\"640\" height=\"475\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"475\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761923364883507_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761923364883507_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761923364883507_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761923364883507_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761923364883507_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761923364883507_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761923364883507_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761923364883507_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the business will continue to be deeply cyclical, a return to zero distribution conditions appears unlikely. Geopolitics and natural gas availability are making nitrogen fertilizer production less economic in many areas of the world. CVRP still enjoys cheap natural gas in the US as well as the unusual capability to use petroleum coke as a feedstock at Coffeyville. Also, the partnership is investing to improve reliability and incrementally increase capacity. So, while high-teens distributions are not guaranteed every year going forward, they are likely for the next 4 quarters with a lower risk of dropping to zero in the future. That makes CVR Partners units a Strong Buy for 2026 with good buy-and-hold prospects for the longer term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 And 2026 Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key operational driver of Q4 for CVRP is the Coffeyville turnaround. This maintenance took place over the month of October and is currently wrapping up. Startup could be delayed a few days as they address the causes of an ammonia release at the start of the turnaround, but Coffeyville should get back to full production over the next couple of weeks. As a result, the overall utilization for the partnership is estimated at 80-85% in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand for the product looks strong in Q4. For example, in the area around the E. Dubuque plant, the harvest is complete, and there has been an optimal amount of rain for the fall application of ammonia. Pricing is also being impacted by supply limitations in the rest of the world, translating into lower US imports.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CVRP often sells products a quarter in advance of delivery, so in a rising market, the realized prices can lag market prices. Market prices in the corn belt in Q3 were $657 per ton for ammonia and $399 per ton for UAN. While not giving guidance on gate prices in Q4, CEO Mark Pytosh indicated \"it's going to be a solid quarter\" with pricing \"higher\" vs. Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My estimate for Q4 gate prices is $360 for UAN and $650 for ammonia. I am assuming midpoint utilization of 82.5%, but I am expecting CVRP to sell the inventory built in Q3 and to release the remaining $2 million of operating reserves. With these inputs, I am forecasting a distribution of $5.17 payable in March 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761925872488498.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CVR Partners Q4 2025 distribution forecast\" width=\"472\" height=\"1132\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"472\" data-height=\"1132\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761925872488498.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761925872488498.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761925872488498.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761925872488498.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761925872488498.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761925872488498.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761925872488498.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/21205541-1761925872488498.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author Spreadsheet</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note that CVRP enjoys unusually high gross margins for a commodity producer, with revenues of $158 million from UAN, ammonia, and co-products in Q4, compared to feedstock costs of only $10 million. (Both figures exclude transportation, which is a cost that CVRP passes on to the customer.) Operating expenses, SG&amp;A, and interest expense are fixed costs, and the reserve for capex has been fairly consistent each quarter. So, as long as gross profit exceeds these fixed costs, higher margins flow straight to the distribution. That is the environment CVRP finds itself in in Q4 and probably H1 2026 as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even though the corn harvest in the US was strong in 2025, with 98.7 million acres of corn yielding 187 bushels per acre, inventory carryout of 13% is below average. This supports continued high planting of corn next year. While acreage was expected to be lower, the CEO stated the drop may not be as much if farmers avoid switching to soybeans because of demand concerns from foreign buyers. (Subsequently, China and the US announced a <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/china-agrees-to-purchase-25-million-metric-tons-of-us-soybeans-annually-treasury-secretary-says/ar-AA1PvfdX?ocid=BingNewsSerp\" rel=\"nofollow\">trade deal</a> on soybeans, but nervousness remains on the certainty.) More corn and less soybeans support nitrogen fertilizer demand, but even a drop to 90 million acres would still be a healthy number for corn.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this demand picture and pricing supported by no change in the global supply picture, continued distributions of $5 or better seem likely at least through the first half of 2026. CVRP will have a turnaround at its smaller E. Dubuque plant in Q3, although they have shown they can smooth out the distributions using cash reserves and inventory management. Q4 will depend on how the 2026 growing season progresses, so it is too early to make a detailed forecast at this point. However, I don't expect prices to fall off a cliff. Adding these quarters up, total distributions approaching $20 are possible in 2026, implying yields near 20% on a $100 unit price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Longer Term Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While down from previous years, the US remains a <a href=\"https://trendeconomy.com/data/h2/UnitedStatesOfAmerica/2814\" rel=\"nofollow\">net importer of nitrogen</a>. That means that supply issues elsewhere in the world impact pricing in the US. Even CVRP's market served by local supply is still indirectly impacted. The US even continues to import fertilizer, especially Urea and UAN, from <a href=\"https://www.usimportdata.com/blogs/us-fertilizer-imports-from-russia\" rel=\"nofollow\">Russia</a>, despite sanctions on other products and financial exchanges.

So, interpolating between the two leftmost bars in the chart above, ammonia costs about €578/tonne, or about $607/short ton, to produce at an existing plant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another impact on the supply side is the shortage of natural gas in Trinidad, formerly a big ammonia exporter. <a href=\"https://www.theglobaleconomy.com/Trinidad-and-Tobago/natural_gas_production/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Natural gas production</a> peaked there in 2011 and is now nearing half of what it was at that time. The declining natural gas availability, along with port restrictions imposed by the government, has resulted in Nutrien (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTR\" title=\"Nutrien Ltd.\">NTR</a>) <a href=\"https://newsday.co.tt/2025/10/21/nutrien-to-shut-down-trinidad-nitrogen-operations/\" rel=\"nofollow\">shutting down its ammonia plant</a> there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These conditions seem likely to persist into 2026. Longer term, an end to hostilities between Russia and Ukraine or Europe abandoning some of its anti-carbon policies could cause global nitrogen prices to ease. Additional plants could also be built in the US, such as one in <a href=\"https://fuelcellsworks.com/2025/10/22/h2/woodside-s-texas-ammonia-plant-set-to-begin-production-by-year-end-as-energy-major-nears-97-percent-completion-milestone\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beaumont, TX</a> starting up later this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over time, an easing of the supply/demand balance could bring prices down from current levels, but CVRP will continue to benefit from its locational advantage near customers and its alternative petroleum coke feedstock at Coffeyville. CVRP is also progressing with its project to give the Coffeyville plant the ability to flex between coke and gas as a feedstock if coke is supply constrained or more expensive. This project has recently been expanded to also allow for incremental hydrogen from the refinery (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVI\" title=\"CVR Energy, Inc.\">CVI</a>) to be fed to the ammonia plant. This would expand capacity by up to 8%. Additional projects were noted on the call, which the partnership has been reserving for over time.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We also continue to execute certain debottlenecking projects at both plants that are expected to improve reliability and production rates. These include water quality upgrade projects at both plants and the expansion of our DEF production and load-out capacity.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These improvements, along with the natural gas supply advantage that has emerged in the US since the mid-2010s, should help CVRP avoid zero distribution situations at cyclical bottoms in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The strong product prices I started talking about earlier in the year have only gotten stronger at the end of 2025 and look to persist for at least the first half of 2026. The partnership will pay total distributions of $11.92 during calendar year 2025, or a backward-looking yield of 12.6%. With distributions above $5 per quarter to start 2026, it is possible for the units to deliver a forward yield approaching 20% even if payouts tail off a bit in the second half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Healthy product demand and global supply limitations should lead to strong prices and margins for CVRP in 2026. The cycle will likely turn down at some point, but CVRP's location and feedstock cost advantage have expanded in the last 10 years, making zero distributions at the bottom of the cycle a less likely outcome. The partnership is also investing to increase capacity and improve utilization to produce more output without a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4823265-structural-changes-in-fertilizer-markets-make-cvr-partners-an-incredible-value\">costly</a> new build.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The partnership units are little changed in price since my last review, even though the near-term economics have improved. That warrants an upgrade to Strong Buy for the short term and attractive buy and hold prospects for the longer term.</p>",

But for long-term investors considering new positions, the real question is<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> this: how many years of returns am I willing to give up for the promise of compounding beyond that point? And this isn’t theoretical. When a company trades at 293 times its forward earnings, you automatically accept that a portion of your future gains has already been pulled forward.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a logical sequence to my previous <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4813076-the-maximum-valuation-for-palantir\">thesis</a>, wherein I had systematically worked through Palantir's TAM to arrive at a maximum valuation of $213 by 2029. The stock is slowly creeping up to that price. And I checked the calendar. It is still 2025. I thought, okay, maybe the aggregate market is looking beyond the 2029 price and maybe the CAGR over a decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The results from my analysis show this is a bet that gets harder as the law of large numbers kicks in. It is hard to predict when, but Palantir remains a favorite candidate of mine for a painful repricing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Breaking down the P/E ratio</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One way to quantify this trade-off is to decompose the P/E ratio in its two distinct states: 1) the “low-growth”, terminal value state and 2) the hypergrowth state. The first part is easier, but we need to iterate the calculation to assume a reasonable discount rate. If you look at a no-growth multiple, it is essentially the inverse of the discount rate. For readers interested in deriving this, you take the discounted cash flow equation with earnings representing cash flows. You then take earnings to the left-hand side and apply g=0 which results in P/E = 1/r.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Price = Earnings x (1 + growth rate (g)) / (discount rate (r) – g).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, if your discount rate is 10%, the multiple is 10x (1/0.10). The 10x multiple is fair, maybe even generous if you look at companies with 0% growth, which often trade at a huge discount. Now I assume a 5% low-growth rate, and this is to account for the idea that lower growth in an AI company could look different. It may be slightly higher than GDP if you account for where the industry could be relative to other industries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">P/E (21) = 1.05 / (10% - 5%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now to calculate the high-growth side of the equation, we need to look at the company’s TTM multiple, as the earnings in the next 12 months are also a part of future growth. Palantir’s TTM multiple is 358 times earnings.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth factor and the number of years</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To translate valuation into time, I calculate what I’d call a growth factor to find how much earnings need to expand to squeeze into a low-growth multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth factor = Starting P/E (358x) / Terminal P/E (21x) = 17.05</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This just tells that Palantir’s earnings must grow by a factor of 17.05 times, or 1,605% from TTM levels, for the 358x multiple to become a 21x multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With growth rates, valuation is a game of being in the ballpark and is not about being precise. What we are looking for is the average CAGR, so the variability isn’t as big of a concern if the average is in the ballpark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The final step is to solve for the number of years (N) to achieve a growth factor of 17.05x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(1 + g<sub>high</sub>)<sup>N</sup> = 17.05</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can solve for N using a range of aggressive growth rates. The table below shows how many years of returns an investor would forgo based on different assumptions for the growth rate. If you want to assume a custom “g” different from the one I assumed, all you have to do is take the log on both sides. So, for a 200% growth, it would be log (17.05) / log (1+ 200%), or 2.5 years.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><strong>Assumed earnings growth</strong></td> <td><strong>Years to payback (N)</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>100.0%</td> <td>4.09</td> </tr> <tr> <td>90.0%</td> <td>4.42</td> </tr> <tr> <td>80.0%</td> <td>4.83</td> </tr> <tr> <td>70.0%</td> <td>5.34</td> </tr> <tr> <td>60.0%</td> <td>6.03</td> </tr> <tr> <td>50.0%</td> <td>6.99</td> </tr> <tr> <td>40.0%</td> <td>8.43</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I assume some of the bullish investors might say that the 100% or 4 years doesn’t sound that bad and the company could maintain a strong momentum beyond that period. The catch is, as the base gets larger each year, it gets harder to achieve the same rate of expansion in the next period. For instance, at a 100% CAGR, the company’s $772.6 million in net income would have to reach $12.3 billion in the next 4 years. This is nearly 3.5 times the TTM revenue and 16 times the TTM net income.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>But What If Palantir Is Truly Different?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bullish investors will correctly argue that this payback model is flawed if Palantir isn't a normal company. The bull case rests on three powerful ideas:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Transformative Tech:</strong> Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is a unique, \"operating system for the enterprise\" that no competitor can match.</li> <li> <strong>Sticky Moat:</strong> The platform creates incredibly high switching costs, locking in customers (both government and commercial) for decades.</li> <li> <strong>Margin Expansion:</strong> As the business scales, the software-based model will lead to massive operating leverage and margin expansion.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These points are not a secret; they are the reason the stock trades at 358x. The question is not if these bull cases are true, but what they are worth. My analysis, which results in a 4-8 year payback period, already assumes a phenomenal, best-in-class CAGR of 40% to 100% for many years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bull case doesn't just need to be right. It needs to be so right that it can deliver growth even beyond these extreme expectations, or it must justify a terminal multiple far higher than 21x. In my view, the \"law of large numbers\" outlined in the 100% CAGR scenario makes this a near-mathematical impossibility.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tying it back to Q3 Expectations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The consensus estimate for revenue is $1.09 billion, which is a sequential growth of 8.7% and a 50% expansion year-over-year. This is in-line with what management guided in Q2, which is why I think they will easily beat the consensus. Tech company guidance tends to be quite conservative, which is also known as “a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sandbag.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">sandbagged</a> number” they can easily beat. More importantly, the diluted EPS growth is expected to be around 78%, which fits in at around 5 years of waiting time for long-term investors looking to accumulate at current levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ll also be closely watching the stock compensation figures, as they are a significant drag on GAAP profitability and shareholder dilution. The market is willing to look past it because the topline growth is so explosive. But the total unrecognized expense is substantial and is <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/e672795c-bf28-4956-9251-6da233852c18.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">close</a> to $1.3 billion as of 2Q 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1179\" data-height=\"423\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SBC (Stock option &amp; SARS)\" width=\"640\" height=\"230\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">SBC (Stock option &amp; SARS) <span>(Palantir 2Q25 10-Q)</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1167\" data-height=\"349\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"RSU &amp; Total SBC\" width=\"640\" height=\"191\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">RSU &amp; Total SBC <span>(Palantir 2Q25 10-Q)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond headline numbers, I think the market will be laser-focused on the quality of revenue. The real engine of growth is the US Commercial segment which is the primary vehicle for the AI platform, or AIP. Investors will be looking for this segment to post numbers that far exceed the blended 50% growth to prove that the AIP adoption thesis is on track. A leading indicator is the commercial customer count. A massive jump would indicate that the “AIP bootcamp” sales funnel is working and give a lot more credibility to the shorter payback period. However, the shorter payback period is still at least 4 years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the earnings, the stock won’t trade on Q3 results but on the Q4 and 2026 guidance. This is where the payback analysis comes full circle. For an investor believing in the shorter payback period, I think management must signal that the 50+% growth trajectory is the new baseline. If management hints at a range of 30% - 40% due to the higher base, I think the stock will experience an immediate and painful repricing. Just based on how difficult it gets to grow at higher bases, I am maintaining a Sell going into Q3 earnings.</p>",

This was a relatively good price for Amplify that was above what I had previously estimated<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> those assets would fetch. This should allow Amplify to pay off most of its $130 million credit facility debt.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amplify is still in the process of selling its Oklahoma assets. If it can get $110 million to $120 million for those assets, that would give it plenty of cash to help fund future Beta development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I've now increased <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4826075-amplify-energy-aiming-for-large-divestitures-to-eliminate-debt-and-focus-on-beta-development\">my upside valuation estimate</a> for Amplify to $8.75 per share (from $8.15 per share). This is based on long-term (after 2026) $70 WTI oil and assumes that Amplify can sell its Oklahoma assets for the above amount, as well as make further progress with cost reductions.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sale Of East Texas Assets</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amplify is selling its East Texas assets for combined consideration of $127.5 million. This includes $5.5 million in net proceeds for its remaining interest in some units with Haynesville rights <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001533924/dd93818d-a0a9-4b27-bc26-f7063287928a.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">and $122 million</a> (subject to customary post-closing adjustments) for its main East Texas assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These East Texas assets had approximately 6,400 BOEPD in Q2 2025 production, and is roughly 5% oil, 27% NGLs, and 68% natural gas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was a relatively strong price of 0.82x Proved PV-10 at $65 WTI oil and $4.00 NYMEX natural gas or 1.06x Proved PV-10 at $70 WTI oil and $3.50 NYMEX natural gas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My rough estimate is that those East Texas assets would have generated around $20 million to $25 million in 2026 EBITDA at current strip prices.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Oklahoma Assets</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amplify is still looking to sell its Oklahoma assets. Those assets produced approximately 4,400 BOEPD in Q2 2025, and the production is roughly 19% oil, 28% NGLs, and 53% natural gas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 2026 EBITDA from the Oklahoma assets would be fairly similar (around $25 million) to the East Texas assets at current strip prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Amplify can get $110 million to $120 million for the Oklahoma assets, that would be a solid amount. The Oklahoma assets have a higher PD PV-10 (at both $65 WTI oil and $4 NYMEX natural gas and $70 WTI oil and $3.50 NYMEX natural gas) than the divested East Texas assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am being more conservative with the multiple (to PD PV-10) for the Oklahoma assets since Amplify had identified somewhat more development potential for its East Texas assets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Effect On Debt</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amplify had $130 million in credit facility debt at the end of Q2 2025, so pro forma for the East Texas divestitures, Amplify will have minimal credit facility debt remaining. The interest rate on Amplify credit facility debt was around 8.4% at the end of 2025, so Amplify will save around $10 million per year in interest costs due to the East Texas sale proceeds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Selling the Oklahoma assets would give Amplify a nice amount of net cash to allow for future Beta development. Otherwise, without a sale of the Oklahoma assets, Amplify may need to take on a bit of credit facility debt again to fund that Beta development.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Upcoming Q3 2025 Earnings Call</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amplify is expected to report Q3 2025 results in a couple of days. Amplify's East Texas divestiture won't affect operational results for that quarter, and I'd assume that Amplify won't update its full year guidance until the deal closes. Since the deal is likely closing in late Q4 2025, there may be relatively minimal impact on 2025 guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key items I am looking for in Amplify's upcoming earnings report are its ability to deliver on its expected lease operating expense reductions and whether there is continued outperformance from its recent Beta wells.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am expecting Amplify to deliver around $20 million to $25 million in adjusted EBITDA in Q3 2025. This would be higher than the $19 million in adjusted EBITDA that it reported in Q2 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My expectations for a modest quarter-over-quarter increase in adjusted EBITDA are driven mainly by Amplify's cost reduction efforts at Bairoil. These savings are expected to more than offset the impact of Amplify's Eagle Ford divestiture (which was around 6% of Amplify's total production and 10% of its oil production) at the beginning of Q3 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amplify reported $38.6 million in lease operating expenses in Q2 2025 (which would have been close to $37 million excluding the Eagle Ford). It has provided guidance for $61 million (or $30 million to $31 million per quarter) in 2H 2025 lease operating expenses, with the reduction driven by Bairoil cost reduction efforts and fewer workovers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm currently expecting Amplify's Q3 2025's lease operating expenses to be a few million higher than its Q4 2025 lease operating expenses due to the Bairoil cost reduction projects being completed partway through Q3 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amplify's Beta development will be the main catalyst for the company after its Oklahoma assets are sold. So far, Amplify's recent Beta D-Sand wells are trending well above type curve, with an estimated combined (for three wells) PV-10 of $49.7 million at $65 WTI oil. I am interested in seeing how these recent wells have performed with another three months worth of data.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"931\" data-height=\"716\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Recent Beta Results\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"492\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Recent Beta Results <span>(amplifyenergy.com (Q2 2025 Presentation))</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These three wells have performed close to 80% above expectations (based on projected PV-10 per well at $65 WTI oil).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Estimated Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I had previously estimated $210 million in net proceeds from the sale of Amplify's East Texas and Oklahoma assets. I am increasing that estimate to $235 million after it received a relatively strong price for its East Texas assets. This adds around $0.60 per share to Amplify's value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus the upside scenario for Amplify increases to around $8.75 per share (from $8.15 per share).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This upside scenario does have several assumptions, though. One assumption is that WTI oil prices will rebound to $70 by 2027. Amplify will be a 100% oil company after it sells its Oklahoma assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A second assumption is that further Beta development and Amplify's cost reduction efforts at Bairoil can reduce its lease operating expenses to around $33 per BOE. This was nearly $42 per BOE for Bairoil and Beta combined in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My final main assumption (for that upside scenario) is that Amplify's cash G&amp;A can go from around $26 million currently to $18 million per year after the East Texas and Oklahoma divestitures.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amplify is selling its East Texas assets for $127.5 million, which should pay off most of its credit facility debt ($130 million at the end of Q2 2025). Amplify is still attempting to sell its Oklahoma assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If it can get $110 million to $120 million for those assets, it would give Amplify a healthy amount of cash for future Beta development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the East Texas asset sale fetched more than I had estimated, I am increasing Amplify's upside value to $8.75 per share. This upside scenario involves $70 WTI oil by 2027 along with continued progress with cost reductions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It will be important for Amplify to continue reducing its operational costs as well as reduce G&amp;A costs, given that its size will be significantly smaller after the divestitures. As well, efficient Beta development (increasing production in the longer-term) will also be very important.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The upcoming Q3 2025 earnings call will give three more months of production data from Amplify's recent Beta wells as well as a partial idea of how much impact its Bairoil cost reduction projects have made on its lease operating expenses.</p>",

One where rather than trading at several multiples over its ETH assets, shares of SBET are currently trading at a fairly large discount to the ETH that the company holds.

This is well ahead of the $2.9 billion market capitalization of the company's shares. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1270\" data-height=\"297\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SharpLink ETH Holdings &amp; NAV\" width=\"640\" height=\"150\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"150\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ETH Holdings &amp; NAV <span>(SharpLink)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At an average paid price of $3,609 per ETH, the company has about a $240 million unrealized ETH gain and has generated over 6.1k ETH in staking rewards. The key difference between Ethereum or even Solana (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SOL-USD\" title=\"Solana USD\">SOL-USD</a>) based DATs compared to the presumably more familiar Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD\" title=\"Bitcoin USD\">BTC-USD</a>) DATs is that ETH and SOL can be productive assets beyond transaction payment tokens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For instance, ETH can be staked natively on chain or through a staking service to generate passive yields and help boost security of the networks where they reside. This is a perfectly fine way to utilize PoS digital assets but it doesn't necessarily make a DAT a better investment than a simple <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835216-grayscale-vs-bitwise-which-solana-etf-is-better\">spot ETF that allows for staking</a>. The latter of which is theoretically much safer and eliminates operational or dilution risk. But because of things like re-staking and DeFi lending, there are more complex ways to generate greater returns than basic staking yields and SharpLink appears poised to do exactly that. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capital Allocation Strategy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4493383-sharplink-begins-utilizing-its-share-buyback-program\">early September</a>, SharpLink began buying back shares and cited undervaluation as the primary reason for doing so. At that time, the company had bought back 939k shares at a price just under $16 per. At an intraday price on October 31st under $14 as of writing, these purchases don't look that great in hindsight. Yet, the ability to buy back its own stock when shares are at depressed levels on an mNAV basis are what separate ETH DATs from BTC DATs. If/<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4827775-strategy-common-stock-dilution-continues\">when MSTR begins to trade under an mNAV of 1 again</a>, Strategy will have to either simply allow it, raise capital through debt or preferreds to buy back common, or sell Bitcoin to protect its equity valuation. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the ETH that SharpLink has purchased is generating yield with very little overhead, management arguably has far better optionality in defending its share price than most BTC-based DATs do. SharpLink can realistically put a floor on its mNAV should it choose to do so. Since the company has reiterated that it won't tap the ATM to buy more ETH when SBET trades at an mNAV discount, dilution concerns should be fairly mitigated at current levels. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More recently, SharpLink has expressed a willingness to go further out on the DeFi risk curve through <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509295-sharplink-to-deploy-200m-of-eth-on-consensys-linea\">ether.fi and EigenCloud</a>. Through either.fi, SharpLink is essentially staking ETH for the passive network yield while also taking a more liquid derivative token of that ETH that can be utilized for lending or re-staking. Doing so adds a small amount of additional risk to the ETH holdings but it does allow the company to generate a small premium on the yield that it would generate from simply staking the ETH passively and leaving it locked. Rather than 3%, SharpLink could be looking at closer to 5% in a conservative re-staking strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At $200 million deployed capital, this is not a large amount of SharpLink's ETH hoard as it's actually less than the company's unrealized gain from its ETH position. But it does allow management to show a competency in DeFi prowess and prove out the concept for shareholders before engaging with these types of networks to a larger degree.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Closing Takeaways</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I actually kind of like SBET at this price. Even though I think Ethereum is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833377-growth-and-a-catalyst-make-binance-coin-more-interesting\">arguably overpriced at 1,100x fees</a>, the degree to which SharpLink can monetize that ETH beyond basic staking strategies is interesting. To be sure, more complex yield strategies introduce an additional element of risk to the company's operations. But I think those risks are necessary to make the company something worth investing in. Truthfully, it may no longer be fair of me to refer to SharpLink simply as an \"Ethereum Wrapper.\" The fact of the matter is the company is starting to put its assets to work in a way that should benefit shareholder returns even in the event Ethereum somehow trades sideways for a considerable amount of time. I don't think sideways action is the most likely scenario for a variety of reasons.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But if we're speculating on the prospects of new financial rails gaining wider adoption in global settlement, I believe Ethereum is a good network to wager on. And the companies that already hold substantial ETH and put that ETH to work could find themselves well positioned for the future. That we can now buy productive ETH at a discount to liquidation value is compelling. I'm upgrading SBET from 'sell' straight to 'buy.'</p>",
