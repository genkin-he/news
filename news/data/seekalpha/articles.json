For its upcoming fiscal first quarter, Nvidia expects revenue of approximately $78B. Analysts had<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> expected the company to generate $72.78B in revenue.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557606-nvidia-stands-alone-upbeat-outlook-sends-stock-higher-leaving-mag-7-in-the-red\">stock price dropped</a> more than 5%. Go figure!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This led me to update my PEG valuation comparison from last year, and the results were very revealing, so I decided to share them.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Updated PEG Ratio Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that P/E Growth Ratios (PEG) are the most important valuation metric for growing companies. PEG = PE / Expected EPS Growth. So, if a company has a P/E of 25 and is expected to grow earnings at 15% annually, its PEG is 25/15 = 1.67. Rather than repeat my description of the importance of PEG valuation for growth companies, I refer you to my two previous articles:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802375-categorizing-tech-companies-valuation-risk\">Categorizing Tech Companies' Valuation Risk</a>.</li> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802375-categorizing-tech-companies-valuation-risk\">Nvidia: It's All About Growth</a>.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most important thing to remember is that a lower PEG is better, and 1.0 is the \"normal\" target.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below is my recomputed PEG ratios for the top tech companies. I also included forward P/E as a reference and compared the companies' PEGs from last year to this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/30457345-1772134883034026_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"896\" data-height=\"878\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/30457345-1772134883034026_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PEG\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"627\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/30457345-1772134883034026_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/30457345-1772134883034026_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/30457345-1772134883034026_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/30457345-1772134883034026_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Comparative PEG Ratios <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There was a significant improvement in PEGs overall, as reflected in median and average. This actually means that tech investments are less risky based on this measurement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I classified them into four categories:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Dark Green</strong> - These have a PEG of less than 1.0, so they have a P/E ratio reasonably balanced to their expected growth. These appear to be the most promising investment opportunities. I own all four of these stocks and will continue to hold them, possibly increasing my position.</li> <li> <strong>Light Green</strong> - These six companies have higher PEG ratios but remain below 2.0. I own all of these and will continue to own them, but I’ll keep an eye on them.</li> <li> <strong>Orange</strong> - With a PEG between 2.0 and 3.0, these companies are in a danger zone. I own IBM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\" title=\"International Business Machines Corporation\">IBM</a>) and Cisco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSCO\" title=\"Cisco Systems, Inc.\">CSCO</a>) and will look at them more closely.</li> <li> <strong>Red</strong> – With a PEG greater than 3.0, I consider these stocks to have P/E ratios may not be justified by their growth expectations. I own Apple but may reduce my position depending on its new product announcements next week, even though it's one of my favorite stocks. I have a short position in Tesla (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA\" title=\"Tesla, Inc.\">TSLA</a>).</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Nvidia's Improved PEG Ratio</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The combination of significant revenue and earnings growth, lower stock price growth in the last nine months, and today's price decline has made Nvidia a stronger buy. Its forward P/E is now below 25X, down from 39.7X in my previous article.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More importantly, its PEG ratio is now well below 1.0 at 0.66, making. it one of the lowest in the comparison. In fact, it's now half of what it was nine months ago (1.36). Nvidia has already grown into its valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Observations on the Other Companies</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are some other important observations as well.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) now has an impressive PEG of 0.66 as well.</li> <li>All companies in the chart, except Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) and Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), have improved their PEGs, and the average and median PEGs have improved substantially. This makes me more comfortable with tech industry investments.</li> <li>Apple is a concern, and you need to watch its upcoming growth expectations.</li> <li>Tesla is still way overvalued.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the tech companies are growing into their valuations, reducing valuation risk. Regarding Nvidia, it's an obvious Buy right now. There is, of course, risk in getting comfortable with its growth expectations, although at its current forward P/E and increased guidance it seems less risky to me.</p>",

Today, the fund's share<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> price has slid to a rather attractive discount relative to its net asset value per share. I believe that makes it a more interesting prospect today, though, looking back since our last write-up, that would have put some negative pressure on the fund's total returns. Further, if we look back further, the current discount still isn't looking like the bargain it may appear at first.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">MCN Basics</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>1-Year Z-score: -0.54</li> <li>Discount/Premium: -6.26%</li> <li>Distribution Yield: 11.73%</li> <li>Expense Ratio: 1.10%</li> <li>Leverage: N/A</li> <li>Managed Assets: $138.339 million</li> <li>Structure: Perpetual</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MCN's <a href=\"https://xainvestments.com/mcn/\" rel=\"nofollow\">investment objective</a> is \"a high level of current income with a secondary objective of long-term capital appreciation...\" They look to achieve this with an \"actively managed equity portfolio comprised of individual stocks and covered call options.\" Additionally, the fund will \"pursue its investment objectives by investing in a portfolio consisting primarily of high-quality, large- and mid-capitalization stocks that are, in the view of the fund's investment sub-adviser, selling at a reasonable price in relation to their long-term earnings growth rates.\"</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance - Discount Opens Up</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since our last write-up, the fund has seen relatively weaker total returns compared to the S&amp;P 500 Index. This would have been partially due to the fund going from a premium to a discount. That would have resulted in the total share price returns being relatively weaker than the total NAV returns. At the same time, there were still some slightly positive total returns during this period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720299849044454.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MCN Performance Since Prior Update\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"259\" height=\"381\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720299849044454.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MCN Performance Since Prior Update <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some could also easily argue that the S&amp;P 500 Index is not a directly appropriate benchmark by which to measure MCN. That is quite true as the fund takes a much more balanced approach in terms of sector allocation—it is not so heavily technology-tilted as the major equity index.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further, the fund employs an overwrite strategy. To factor this in, the fund provides a benchmark of the CBOE S&amp;P 500 Buy/Write Index instead. Relative to that, MCN has delivered results that have been rather competitive over the longer term, but shorter-term results have fallen short.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003631820219_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"994\" data-height=\"343\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003631820219_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MCN Annualized Performance\" width=\"640\" height=\"221\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"221\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003631820219_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003631820219_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003631820219_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003631820219_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MCN Annualized Performance <span>(XA Investments)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Worth noting is that in 2024, the fund's name changed and the advisor changed; however, the same management team remained the sub-advisor, and the investment strategy of the fund remained the same.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In looking at the longer-term history of the fund's valuation, the current discount presents a more attractive entry price. However, it is also worth noting that the fund traded at a relatively outsized premium for a handful of years—this would have naturally reduced the overall average level of the last decade. Before around 2021, an 8%-12% discount was not all that unusual.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_37ba4c19e098c1a056c28dbe72101e94.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"424\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_37ba4c19e098c1a056c28dbe72101e94.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_37ba4c19e098c1a056c28dbe72101e94.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_37ba4c19e098c1a056c28dbe72101e94.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ycharts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, while in the short term it presents an enticing time to enter a position, I am not leaning overly bullish quite yet.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Distribution - Double-Digit Looking Tempting</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of the distribution, they actually switched to a monthly payout since we last touched on this fund. This is often seen as more attractive for income-focused investors, and they also kept the same equivalent amount being paid out—simply going from $0.18 quarterly to $0.06 per month. Based on the current rate and price, the distribution yield comes in at a tempting 11.73%. On a NAV basis, this is a touch lower at 10.99%, thanks to the discount opening up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720312497594328_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MCN Distribution History\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"278\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720312497594328_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720312497594328_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720312497594328_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720312497594328_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MCN Distribution History <span>(CEFConnect)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, I had a similar warning during our last update that the fund's distribution is quite tempting, but this is fairly elevated for a call writing fund, at least relative to its CEF peers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, they have paid out this same amount since going back to the Global Financial Crisis, so clearly, this is a level that they would like to maintain. After all, the longer they can keep it at this level, the more likely it is that the fund may return to a premium again one day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The downside of this is that it becomes more difficult to continue to achieve the returns necessary. As an equity-focused fund, to cover the payout, it will require substantial capital gains to be generated. That can come via the underlying portfolio or the call-writing strategy. Should that not be achieved, then that means a slowly eroding NAV over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the case of MCN, the NAV has been slowly heading downward since the end of 2021 to its latest fiscal year end, 2025. This is usually not a great sign, as it would indicate some difficulty in covering its payout from the income and appreciation necessary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003231001306_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1662\" data-height=\"723\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003231001306_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MCN Financial Highlights\" width=\"640\" height=\"278\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"278\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003231001306_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003231001306_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003231001306_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003231001306_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MCN Financial Highlights <span>(XA Investments)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, that's why I believe the current distribution rate is not only elevated at a double-digit rate, which tends to be the rather common-sense red flag level, but also based on what the fund has been able to achieve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of tax purposes, the fund has classified the distribution primarily as ordinary income, but also as return of capital. For this fiscal year, it was a bit different because the fiscal year end was moved from lining up with the calendar year to ending Sept. 30, 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003018121378_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1659\" data-height=\"571\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003018121378_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EHI Distribution Tax Classification\" width=\"640\" height=\"220\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"220\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003018121378_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003018121378_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003018121378_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003018121378_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EHI Distribution Tax Classification <span>(XA Investments)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">MCN's Portfolio</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to the options strategy, the fund is fairly heavily overwritten. The latest puts it at 86.5%, with the number of equity positions at 40 and option holdings at 44. The average contract length is also on the longer end relative to most peers that I look at in the call writing fund space, with MCN's average contract length at over 46 days. Eaton Vance, for example, often rolls contracts every two weeks. For the NEOS ETFs that have become quite popular, they write options monthly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720304389107246.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MCN Fund Characteristics\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"531\" height=\"225\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720304389107246.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720304389107246.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720304389107246.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MCN Fund Characteristics <span>(XA Investments)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What key piece of information that is missing on the stats here would be how far out-of-the-money, or perhaps even, in-the-money, these contracts are. That could indicate potentially how much upside the underlying positions could participate in before they reach the covered call upside cap. Given the fund is heavily overwritten, this could be quite meaningful. On the other hand, the longer average contract lengths likely mean they can write a bit further OTM, while still collecting a decent chunk of premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of sector weighting, information technology is the largest slice of the pie here, but it isn't overly overweight in the sector. Healthcare, financials, consumer staples, and energy all also come in quite closely in terms of their exposure as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720306288494692_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MCN Industry Allocation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"403\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720306288494692_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720306288494692_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720306288494692_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720306288494692_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MCN Industry Allocation <span>(XA Investments)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that, one of the more appropriate comparisons of MCN could be to a fund like the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantaged ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RSPA\" title=\"Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF\">RSPA</a>). When looking back at the performance, we are quite limited due to RSPA's inception being in mid-2024. That said, so far, the results heavily favor RSPA—that's even pretty meaningful in terms of the total NAV returns, MCN has slipped quite a bit, relatively speaking.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_1f39a2cadc63e8bf931e60581c0a3344.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"525\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_1f39a2cadc63e8bf931e60581c0a3344.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_1f39a2cadc63e8bf931e60581c0a3344.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_1f39a2cadc63e8bf931e60581c0a3344.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ycharts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While this is past performance, it at least indicates a relatively poor result so far. That could always change moving forward, but I think it also highlights the fact that an even larger discount would be necessary for MCN before it starts to become worthwhile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In looking at the top ten, the allocations are fairly hefty, with these representing just over 33.3% of the overall investments of the portfolio. At only 40 equity positions, this also isn't that unexpected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of unique exposure, I think the box is checked here. There are not many funds that have this assortment of top holdings being represented, aside from Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) and Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) being regulars in most funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720308498948846_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MCN Top Ten Holdings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"196\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720308498948846_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720308498948846_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720308498948846_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720308498948846_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MCN Top Ten Holdings <span>(XA Investments)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MCN provides investors a fairly unique portfolio with a portfolio that isn't overly emphasizing tech allocation. The fund managers then apply a covered call strategy on top. The fund is heavily overwritten, and that can run into the usual pitfall of covered call funds, limited potential upside due to being capped. The longer-term results of the fund put up competitive results against its benchmark, but the performance in more recent years has begun to falter. Along with that faltering, the fund's total share price returns have been even more negatively impacted, with the fund going from a premium to a discount. At this time, while it becomes a more interesting name to consider, I still wouldn't be looking to buy too aggressively here.</p>",

Aristocrats, on average, have started the year very hot, not all of them are equally attractive investment opportunities at the moment. To identify the most promising Aristocrats, I focus on two key metrics: potential undervaluation and projected long-term total return.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation is assessed using dividend yield theory, which compares the current dividend yield to the 5-year rolling average. The potential long-term return is calculated as the sum of expected future earnings growth, the forward dividend yield, and a potential boost from mean reversion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of February 26th, 25 Dividend Aristocrats appear to be both potentially undervalued and have a long-term annualized expected rate of return of at least 10%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These Aristocrats were identified with a long-term focus, based on their current valuation and estimated future growth.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td> </td> <td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Price</strong></td> <td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Dividend Yield</strong></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Ticker</strong></td> <td><strong>Current</strong></td> <td><strong>Fair</strong></td> <td><strong>Over/Under</strong></td> <td><strong>Current</strong></td> <td><strong>Trailing</strong></td> <td><strong>Estimated ROR</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>ABT</td> <td>114.76</td> <td>139.45</td> <td>-17.70%</td> <td>2.20%</td> <td>1.81%</td> <td>16.23%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>ADM</td> <td>67.45</td> <td>74.43</td> <td>-9.38%</td> <td>3.08%</td> <td>2.79%</td> <td>12.27%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>ADP</td> <td>214.25</td> <td>322.15</td> <td>-33.49%</td> <td>3.17%</td> <td>2.11%</td> <td>20.81%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AMCR</td> <td>48.82</td> <td>54.26</td> <td>-10.02%</td> <td>5.33%</td> <td>4.79%</td> <td>17.13%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>BDX</td> <td>180.96</td> <td>203.01</td> <td>-10.86%</td> <td>2.32%</td> <td>2.07%</td> <td>12.74%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>BF.B</td> <td>28.10</td> <td>53.24</td> <td>-47.22%</td> <td>3.27%</td> <td>1.73%</td> <td>17.34%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>BEN</td> <td>27.26</td> <td>27.52</td> <td>-0.95%</td> <td>4.84%</td> <td>4.80%</td> <td>17.58%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>BRO</td> <td>70.05</td> <td>99.01</td> <td>-29.25%</td> <td>0.94%</td> <td>0.67%</td> <td>16.25%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>CLX</td> <td>126.24</td> <td>151.13</td> <td>-16.47%</td> <td>3.93%</td> <td>3.28%</td> <td>12.94%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>ERIE</td> <td>269.81</td> <td>324.17</td> <td>-16.77%</td> <td>2.17%</td> <td>1.80%</td> <td>29.91%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>ES</td> <td>74.92</td> <td>81.08</td> <td>-7.59%</td> <td>4.20%</td> <td>3.89%</td> <td>10.39%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>FDS</td> <td>206.62</td> <td>452.80</td> <td>-54.37%</td> <td>2.13%</td> <td>0.97%</td> <td>26.27%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>GPC</td> <td>116.92</td> <td>154.86</td> <td>-24.50%</td> <td>3.63%</td> <td>2.74%</td> <td>13.97%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>HRL</td> <td>25.31</td> <td>38.19</td> <td>-33.73%</td> <td>4.62%</td> <td>3.06%</td> <td>20.24%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>KMB</td> <td>109.21</td> <td>138.25</td> <td>-21.00%</td> <td>4.69%</td> <td>3.70%</td> <td>12.43%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>MKC</td> <td>69.03</td> <td>92.53</td> <td>-25.40%</td> <td>2.78%</td> <td>2.08%</td> <td>15.85%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>NEE</td> <td>95.11</td> <td>96.35</td> <td>-1.29%</td> <td>2.62%</td> <td>2.58%</td> <td>11.40%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PEP</td> <td>169.17</td> <td>184.06</td> <td>-8.09%</td> <td>3.36%</td> <td>3.09%</td> <td>11.65%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>PPG</td> <td>123.12</td> <td>143.24</td> <td>-14.05%</td> <td>2.31%</td> <td>1.98%</td> <td>13.36%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>ROP</td> <td>344.24</td> <td>625.88</td> <td>-45.00%</td> <td>1.06%</td> <td>0.58%</td> <td>22.15%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>SJM</td> <td>106.60</td> <td>131.34</td> <td>-18.83%</td> <td>4.13%</td> <td>3.35%</td> <td>10.13%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>SPGI</td> <td>423.61</td> <td>463.74</td> <td>-8.65%</td> <td>0.92%</td> <td>0.84%</td> <td>14.97%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>SWK</td> <td>85.26</td> <td>99.34</td> <td>-14.17%</td> <td>3.89%</td> <td>3.34%</td> <td>21.80%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>TROW</td> <td>95.27</td> <td>127.75</td> <td>-25.43%</td> <td>5.46%</td> <td>4.07%</td> <td>12.45%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>WST</td> <td>247.88</td> <td>347.71</td> <td>-28.71%</td> <td>0.36%</td> <td>0.25%</td> <td>18.95%</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Yield Theory &amp; Expected Rate of Return</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's take a closer look at the dividend yield theory valuation and the potential total return for all 25 Aristocrats listed above.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Please note that I use the most current forward dividend rate for 2026 which may overstate the dividend growth rate for that year in the tables below.

Licensing &amp; Royalties generated $108 million—73% of total revenues. Direct Product Sales were just $39 million. In other words, Novavax is now essentially a royalty collection agency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While management’s FY26 revenue guide ($230M-$270M) implies a ~75% drop from the $1.1 billion reported for 2025, it’s a cleaner revenue stream. 2025 revenue was primarily composed of “paper gains” from settling old contracts ($625M).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, management’s revenue guidance did<em> not</em> include a potential $125 million milestone from Sanofi’s Phase 3 initiation of the COVID/influenza vaccine and a $75 million milestone from the tech transfer completion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just a few quarters ago, Novavax had “going concern” warnings. But they ended FY25 with $857 million in cash and accounts receivable—enough to fund operations “<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875693-novavax-inc-nvax-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">into 2028</a>.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a much different company. Novavax’s past attempt to scale NUVAXOVID was met with commercial realities like a commoditized vaccination market, powerful competition, and decelerating demand. Today, large partners are paying big, high-margin bucks to utilize their technology.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Part of Novavax’s recent gains are associated with the market beginning to value its stock more like a \"royalty-bearing enabler.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Two comparators that immediately come to my mind include Halozyme (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HALO\" title=\"Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc.\">HALO</a>) and Royalty Pharma (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RPRX\" title=\"Royalty Pharma plc\">RPRX</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047116012585_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"798\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047116012585_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Author's Compilation\" width=\"640\" height=\"249\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047116012585_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047116012585_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047116012585_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047116012585_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Compilation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, for what it is, I think Novavax is properly valued.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike Halozyme and Royalty Pharma—who earn royalties on multiple approved products—Novavax is enjoying the certainty of upfront and near-term milestone payments for now. A lot of the value in the partnerships they’ve struck is “backloaded” and dependent on uncertain clinical trial outcomes. Then—of course—Novavax is much more dependent on any one partner than are Halozyme and Royalty. Finally, Halozyme and Royalty have proven models that have consistently generated cash.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So Novavax should trade at a discount and, honestly, it’s probably a bit early for me to even compare the three. In any event, this is the type of model that Novavax is aiming for.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pipeline</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875693-novavax-inc-nvax-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">call</a>, “C. diff” was a popular topic—mentioned over a dozen times.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047119480915_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1326\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047119480915_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" width=\"640\" height=\"414\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047119480915_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047119480915_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047119480915_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047119480915_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Compilation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike other indications within their <a href=\"https://www.novavax.com/products-pipeline/pipeline\" rel=\"nofollow\">pipeline</a> (pictured above), C. difficile would be a much less crowded market than, say, RSV and shingles. So I think this is why Novavax focused so much on the preclinical prospect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Previous C. difficile vaccine attempts have <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/news/2026-02-experimental-vaccine-diff-disease-recurrence.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">failed</a>. There are a few reasons why. For one, older vaccines aimed to neutralize the toxins produced by the bacteria—leaving folks colonized still. C. difficile is also contained within the GI tract, so vaccine protection requires mucosal immunity. And narrow antigen coverage may have been insufficient.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Novavax is aiming to target a variety of antigens and toxins, as well as curb bacterial colonization. Its Matrix-M technology may help enhance the immune response to hone in on mucosal immunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Elsewhere, Novavax is hoping to \"shake more hands\" for its internal COVID/influenza and influenza programs. Remember that Novavax prefers to secure a partner rather than funding a large, late-stage program all their lonesome.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Words</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Novavax has “turned a corner,” it’s still a ways from long-term assurance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s goal of \"profitability by 2028” is largely in the hands of Sanofi and the upcoming Phase 3 program for the COVID/influenza vaccine. If that one program slips/produces mediocre data, Novavax would take a hit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, at the end of the day, Novavax’s platform is its “saving grace” and serves as a pungent reminder to the importance of “moat” in this sector. If Novavax was merely dependent on NUVAXOVID as a stand-alone asset, this article would’ve been written in a totally different tone.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, NVAX appears appropriately valued (maintain “Hold”) and is a good candidate for a speculative position within the context of a barbell portfolio given its high-risk/high-reward nature. There is also still potential for regulatory risks—like vaccine misinformation, BLA rejection, and license revocation.</p>",

A lack of execution and past disappointments make it difficult to build conviction, although the company still has time to (partially) recover from this.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some Perspective</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aspen Aerogels started its corporate history as a provider of industrial insulation activities, this being a $100 million but lossmaking business when the company went public a little over a decade ago. Understanding what happened to the business is key, as multiple boom-bust cycles and strategic pivots explain why the company finds itself where it sits today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the company failed to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability, the company decided to reposition its business to provide solutions for EV batteries. This made it so that a share price of just a dollar ended up rising to a high of $60 in 2021, followed by a pullback to the low single digits in 2023. This was followed by a recovery to the $30 mark in 2024, with shares now back down again at just about $3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These developments came as the company saw strong growth coming out of the pandemic. Revenues rose nearly 50% to $180 million in 2022 as growth slowed to 30% in 2023, yet growth accelerated to triple digits in 2024, which made the production capacity limits of $650 million come within sight.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To facilitate further and continued growth, the company was looking to build a huge new plant, at a nearly $2 billion bill, aided by the help of the DOE and external financiers. All this was driven by a strong 2024, with revenues reported up 90% to $453 million, accompanied by an operating profit of $53 million.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Big Implosion</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the company guided for first quarter sales for 2025 to come in below the hundred million mark, the bigger news was that the company halted construction of its new and giant plant. Revenues quickly fell to a run rate of $300 million, with no realistic operating profits seen anymore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this stands in sharp contrast to the growth reported in the years before, attributed to oversupply of its solutions to EV manufacturers. Worse, with developments continuing in solid-state batteries, the company could be facing a long-term threat, as such batteries could result in much less demand for its products in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conditions remained brutal as third quarter sales of $73 million were still somewhat reasonable at a near $300 million run rate, yet the company guided for fourth-quarter sales to fall to just $45 million, to be accompanied by EBITDA losses of $10 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company claimed that it could reduce EBITDA break-even levels to $200 million while maintaining a gross cash position of at least $100 million, as a new European contract might even bring in $150 million in revenues as soon as 2027.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">More Disappointments</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By the end of February, Aspen <a href=\"https://ir.aerogel.com/news/news-details/2026/Aspen-Aerogels-Inc--Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Financial-Results-and-Recent-Business-Highlights/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.aerogel.com/news/news-details/2026/Aspen-Aerogels-Inc--Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Financial-Results-and-Recent-Business-Highlights/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">delivered</a> disastrous results at the end of the year. Fourth quarter sales imploded to $41 million. Thermal barrier revenues, those being EV insulation revenues, fell to just $16 million, as lower demand no longer provided a valid excuse to call out capacity constraints for the energy industrial business. Revenues of that segment were cut more than in half to $25 million as well. All this weighed heavily on the P&amp;L statement, with gross profits even reported at negative $23 million and GAAP operating losses reported at $70 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Worse, first quarter sales are seen down further to $35-$40 million, with adjusted EBITDA losses seen between minus $10 and $13 million; this actually marks a modest improvement from a negative $18 million number in the fourth quarter as the company works to lower costs. The company actually maintained a net cash position of just more than $50 million here, depending on the exact definition of net debt, as 82 million shares traded around the $3 mark, for a near quarter of a billion equity valuation here.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Now?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's clear is that expectations are very low, with Aspen's operating assets valued at just around $200 million. Moreover, while near-term losses will continue, some cash inflows are expected as well. In March, the company expects to obtain a $38 million cash payment fro<span class=\"highlighted_text\">m GM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GM\" title=\"General Motors Company\">GM</a>)</span> relating to a commercial settlement relating to EV capacity adjustments. Moreover, a non-binding LOI for the sale of the Georgia facility has been signed (at an unknown price) as the European customer announced in the fourth quarter was identified to be Volvo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even more extreme, reviews are seen for the commercial growth plans and the capital structure as the company continues to reduce the break-even point of the business. EBITDA breakeven levels for 2025 were seen at $270 million; this number is seen coming down to $200 million in 2026 and even a bit further into 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, sequential revenue growth is seen in 2026, albeit that the bar is low, driven by recovery of GM volumes, greater subsea industrial orders, as well as recovery of the EV market at large.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In between sufficient liquidity, Aspen is not in real financial stress (yet) and certainly has a chance to improve its fortunes, but that requires great efforts, yet fortunately from a position of a net cash position. A combination of continued cost cuts and sequential revenue growth could be helping here, although much progress is needed.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this remains highly speculative after investors in Aspen have been burned many times in recent times. While there appears to be a base underneath the business, and the company has some potential triggers, the reality is that the risk-reward might be reasonable, although this is a hugely speculative stance. We have higher conviction ideas at <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/486-value-in-corporate-events/articles\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/486-value-in-corporate-events/articles\" target=\"_blank\">Value in Corporate Events</a>, but will continue to monitor what happens next at the company.</p>",

NVDA delivered a record breaking Q3 with 62.5% YoY revenue growth which took its valuation to less than 20 times forward earnings. The hyperscalers fueled NVDA's growth with massive CapEx investments as they evolved into the core infrastructure provider for the AI era. While Q3 was very strong their Q4 results were incredible and NVDA just broke several all-time records from revenue to profitability. I am more bullish than ever about NVDA as this is one of the cheapest valuations we have seen for the largest company in the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am following up with a new article because I believe that NVDA is mispriced and the current valuation is creating a large opportunity for shareholders.

NVDA just generated $68.13 billion in revenue which was a 19.51% growth rate QoQ and 73.21% YOY. This quarter proved that NVDA is experiencing reaccelerating growth on a YoY basis. In Q3 2024 NVDA reached a 122.4% YoY growth rate which fell sequentially over the next year to 55.60%. In Q3 their revenue growth rate increased by 6.89% to 62.49% and in Q4 the revenue growth rate increased 10.72% to 73.21%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA’s data center division generated $62.3 billion in revenue in Q4 which was a YoY increase of 75%. In Q4 NVDA generated $51.09 billion in gross profit and $42.96 billion in net income which were both new records. NVDA maintained a 75% gross profit margin while increasing their profit margin by 7.08% to 63.06%. NVDA’s revenue growth and margin is expanding on a YoY basis and they just guided for $78 billion in revenue for their Q1 results which would imply that they are expecting a YoY growth rate of 77.02%. The AI buildout isn’t stopping and the market is getting this wrong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502462666_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1428\" data-height=\"680\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502462666_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NVDA Revenue\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"305\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502462666_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502462666_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502462666_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502462666_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Steven Fiorillo, Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bull case isn’t dependent on one product cycle or one hyperscaler going against the grain as we’re experiencing a structural shift of how work gets done. AI workloads are becoming more inference heavy and more distributed which expands the opportunities for NVDA as their GPUs can be combined with networking, software and full stack systems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA outlined $11B of networking revenue in Q4 and discussed how it led to $31 billion of revenue this year. NVDA is seeing strong adoption in NVLink, Spectrum-X Ethernet, and InfiniBand as their customers are unifying distributed data centers into AI factories. On the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874926-nvidia-corporation-nvda-q4-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a>, NVDA discussed that Blackwell Ultra can deliver up to 50x better performance and 35x lower cost for agentic AI compared to Hopper. They are positioning the Vera Rubin cycle as the next platform that will be a continuation of the AI factory buildout wave. The Rubin platform which is six new chips will target a 10x reduction in inference token cost compared to Blackwell and they are expecting that the hyperscalers will be the first to deploy these systems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is super bullish for NVDA because the roadmap of future chips are being absorbed as quickly as NVDA can ship them. The way that I am looking at this is that as AI becomes agentic its always on and compute is no longer a one-time training event as it becomes a recurring necessity. We are seeing that networking is scaling which is likely to enhance the flywheel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501407676_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"742\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501407676_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Hyperscaler CapEx\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"396\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501407676_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501407676_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501407676_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501407676_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Steven Fiorillo, Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reality is that the combination of META, MSFT, AMZN, and GOOGL allocated $140.13 billion towards CapEx in 2023 then increased their spend by 55.04% ($77.14 billion) in 2024 to $217.27 billion. This year the CapEx spend from these companies increased to $357.51 billion as it grew YoY by 65.55% ($140.24 billion). For the 2026 fiscal year, these companies are projecting to allocate $610 billion toward CapEx which is an additional $252.49 billion and a YoY growth rate of 70.63%. These companies have the balance sheets and the cash flow to fund this build out for years to come, and MSFT reports their full year results in the summer while guiding for the next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that they are still in a \"prisoners dilemma\" situation, especially with the advancements in NVDA’s chips. If the Rubin platform can generate a 10x reduction in inference token cost compared to Blackwell and Blackwell deliver up to 50x better performance and 35x lower cost for agentic AI compared to Hopper these companies have no choice but to upgrade unless they all say no. Any company that doesn’t upgrade will be at a disadvantage because they will have to charge more for compute and they won’t deliver advancements as quickly as their peers. NVDA is at the center of the AI revolution and the buildout doesn’t look like it’s stopping anytime soon.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Nvidia’s valuation is dirt cheap at these levels</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/earnings/estimates\">NVDA</a> just got cheaper as the stock is off more than 5% since the earnings print and the street increased their expected forward earnings. NVDA is expected to generate $8.26 of EPS this year and $13.07 in 2028. This is an increased of 58.32% over the next 2 fiscal years which is the most in the Magnificent Seven. NVDA is trading at 22.36 times this years earnings and 14.13 times 2027 earnings. NVDA is now trading at the cheapest valuation in the Magnificent Seven and companies such as Walmart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>) and Costco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COST\" title=\"Costco Wholesale Corporation\">COST</a>) are trading at valuations that are double NVDA’s with less than half of the EPS growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that the numbers are showing that NVDA is being mispriced on overblown fears about how much more buildout is left in the AI revolution. At these levels, I believe that NVDA is providing investors with a great opportunity to unlock future value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-1772144851671753_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1171\" data-height=\"260\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-1772144851671753_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NVDA Forward EPS\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"142\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-1772144851671753_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-1772144851671753_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-1772144851671753_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-1772144851671753_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Steven Fiorillo, Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>NVIDIA is becoming the Berkshire Hathaway of technology</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557785-nvidia-confirms-its-finalizing-deal-with-openai\">NVDA</a> confirmed that its finalizing its deal with OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>), and I couldn’t be more excited.

I believe that NVDA is starting to become the Berkshire Hathaway (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.A</a>) of technology, and believe that they should make more investments throughout the AI ecosystem as this is likely to be the largest technological revolution the world has ever seen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The real question is what does a company do when they are generating $14.32 billion in net income per month? In <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20414347-nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2026\">Q4, NVDA</a> generated $42.96 billion in net income which is $14.32 billion per month and on an annualized basis they generated $120.07 billion in net income for the year which was $2.31 billion per week. Based on the Q4 results, NVDA is on a run rate of $171.84 billion in net income for this fiscal year, which is 3.3 billion per week of pure profit. Companies can buy back shares, pay down debt, pay dividends, reinvest in themselves, or make investments with their treasure trove of profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA has $7.47 billion in long-term debt on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a> with $62.56 billion in cash on hand. They are already buying back <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/cash-flow-statement\">$48.03 billion</a> worth of shares. As a shareholder I love the idea of NVDA making investments into companies such as OpenAI and CRWV and hope it doesn’t stop there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502681885_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1268\" data-height=\"825\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502681885_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CES Presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"416\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502681885_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502681885_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502681885_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502681885_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Nvidia Corporation </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When NVDA makes an investment into these companies it is trading cash for equity. Currently CRWV is trading at $96.39 which is 10.54% higher than where NVDA purchased $2 billion worth of shares at. This means that NVDA has shares of CRWV that were worth roughly $2.21 billion on the balance sheet, which is a better ROI then plowing the capital into bonds. The current funding round for <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-19/openai-nears-100-billion-funding-at-850-billion-valuation\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenAI</a> will place its valuation at $850 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If NVDA allocated $50 billion towards the deal, they would own 5.88% of OpenAI, and if they allocate $100 billion toward OpenAI they would own 11.76% of the company. An investment of $50 billion or $100 billion is not a small amount but the reality is that both numbers will likely be a fraction of NVDA’s profitability this year. NVDA has the cash to make these investments and if OpenAI becomes a multi trillion dollar company over the next 5-10 years shareholders of NVDA will benefit a great deal by having a significant amount of ownership of it on the balance sheet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other aspect that many individuals are overlooking is that this isn’t funny accounting. NVDA is making cash investments in these companies for hard equity that sits on their books. What these companies choose to do with that capital is their business. The fact that they will be buying more GPU’s from NVDA is an added bonus that NVDA will recognize 100% of the profits because they already traded the cash for the equity. The sale of the GPU’s is a completely separate transaction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that a lot of people believe that NVDA is funding the future sales of GPUs with its own money which isn’t the case. NVDA traded their capital for the equity in these companies and the sale of GPUS will be just an added benefit. Over time I believe that these types of deals will generate a tremendous amount of value for NVDA and their shareholders and I wouldn’t be surprised if we see more deals like this from NVDA in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks to investing in Nvidia</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I am bullish on NVDA there are several risk factors to consider. NVDA just delivered 73.21% YoY growth and guided for $78 billion of revenue in Q1 which would be 77.02% YoY growth and the market punished them. Shares are selling off after what could be the best quarter in the history of the stock market as no company this size has ever grew their quarterly revenue by 73% YoY. Even though revenue is reaccelerating the market is clearly concerned about when the revenue growth will slowdown and when the CapEx buildout will turn from expansion to maintenance. NVDA is at the mercy of the hyperscalers deploying CapEx and if the market can convince them that they are spending too much on AI infrastructure the recent selloff after Q4 earnings may look mild compared to what could happen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA is a victim of its own success, and the fact that it couldn’t break out after this quarter could be a signal that we have seen a top in its shares. Investors should do their own due diligence, as there isn’t going to be a bell that signals the investments into the AI revolution are curtailing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was another drop the mic moment for NVDA as their Q4 revenue signaled the reacceleration of growth wasn’t a fluke in Q3. I am shocked that shares sold off more than -5% after earnings as the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/earnings/estimates\">analyst community</a> is signaling that NVDA will deliver roughly $259.34 billion in revenue which is a 66.41% YoY growth rate. NVDA is now trading at the cheapest levels the market has seen is quite some time as investors are able to pay less than 24 times this year earnings and less than 20 times next years earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After reading through the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874926-nvidia-corporation-nvda-q4-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a> and looking at the data from the hyperscalers, I don’t believe we are anywhere close to the AI buildout being over as each generation of NVDA’s chips provide advancements that they are unable to live without. The market is punishing many companies related to the data center buildout which is creating an opportunity for long-term investors. While the markets can be irrational at times I believe that shares of NVDA will rebound and have a good chance of reaching $250 in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501352518_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1213\" data-height=\"339\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501352518_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NVDA Forward Revenue\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"179\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501352518_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501352518_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501352518_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501352518_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The Q&amp;A starts. And within minutes, someone asks the question that always shows up:</p> <p><em>“Why is it down?”</em></p> <p>Sometimes it’s a stock you own. Sometimes it’s one you’re watching. Sometimes it’s a<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> company that </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content\">shouldn’t</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> be down because, on paper, it looks “fine.” The dividend is still getting paid. The business isn’t bankrupt. Yet, the market has decided to take a chunk out of the price.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here’s the thing: a stock can be down for a dozen reasons - and most investors look in the wrong place first. They hunt for a headline, a tweet, or a hot take. That approach usually creates more stress than clarity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What you want instead is a repeatable process. One you can use every time a stock drops, whether it’s down 5% in a day or 25% over six months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s walk through the exact checklist I use to answer “Why is it down?” - and more importantly, to decide whether it’s a <em>problem</em>... or an <em>opportunity</em>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 1: Let the Numbers Speak First (but don’t stop there)</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before you read opinions, read facts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Start with the basics: <em>revenue, profit, and the dividend</em>. In most cases, one of those three will explain the move (or at least point you in the right direction).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A stock is often down because the latest results show one of these:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue slowed, declined, or missed expectations</li> <li>Earnings dropped (or the market thinks they will)</li> <li>Margins compressed (costs rose faster than sales)</li> <li>Management guided lower for the next quarter or year</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Compare the right periods.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Year-over-year (Q1 vs. Q1 last year) is usually the cleanest comparison, because businesses are seasonal. Ski companies don’t sell skis in July, and hardware stores don’t move snowblowers in May.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sometimes management highlights sequential improvement (Q1 vs. Q4) if last year’s quarter was unusually strong or weak. That can be useful, but your default should be year-over-year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 2: Go Deeper into the Quarterly Earnings Story</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Once you’ve spotted what moved, the next job is to find <em>why</em>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is where most investors stop too early. They read: “EPS down 12%” and assume the company is in trouble. But “EPS down” can mean many different things.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here are common scenarios that push stocks lower:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Revenue is stable, but EPS is falling.</strong>That’s often a margin story. Input costs, wages, shipping, marketing, or discounting ate into profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Revenue is rising, but EPS is shrinking.</strong>This can happen when growth comes with costs: a new product rollout, an expansion, or an acquisition that hasn’t paid off yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>EPS dropped because of “one-time” items.</strong>Impairment charges, restructuring costs, legal settlements, or write-downs can crush reported earnings. They may not be recurring - but they still matter because they signal something changed.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">And one important reminder: EPS isn’t always the best metric.</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For capital-intensive businesses (pipelines, utilities, telecoms) and REITs, earnings can look ugly due to depreciation and other non-cash items. In those cases, metrics like DCF per share, FFO per share, or AFFO per share may tell the real story. If you judge the wrong business with the wrong tool, you’ll draw the wrong conclusion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 3: Use the Dividend Triangle as Your Health Check</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When a stock is down, your brain wants to stare at the price chart. I’d rather you look at the <a href=\"https://thedividendguyblog.com/dividend-triangle/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">Dividend Triangle</a> and ask three questions:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Are revenues growing?</li> <li>Are earnings (or the right cash metric) growing?</li> <li>Is the dividend growing?</li> </ul> <figure class=\"paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_dividend-triangle.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Dividend triangle representation.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_dividend-triangle.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_dividend-triangle.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_dividend-triangle.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Dividend triangle representation.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But here’s the nuance: metrics alone don’t tell the full story. Trends do.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Two companies can have similar revenue growth this year but very different realities:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>One has a steady, repeatable upward slope.</li> <li>The other is bouncing around with more volatility than your teenager’s mood.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That difference matters. A slowing trend in earnings, or in dividend growth losing steam, is often where the early warning signs appear. The Dividend Triangle <em>trendline</em> tells you whether the business is strengthening or weakening.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 4: Zoom Out - This Is Where You Avoid Dumb Decisions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A single bad quarter is not a trend. It’s a data point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s why you look at 3-5 years of quarterly progression. You’re trying to categorize what you’re seeing:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Blip - One ugly quarter in an otherwise stable upward trend</li> <li>Business as usual - The result looks weak, but it’s within the normal pattern</li> <li>Trend change - Multiple quarters moving in the wrong direction</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is the step that turns panic into perspective. If you skip it, you’re basically letting the market’s mood swing control your portfolio.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 5: Identify the Narrative</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stocks don’t move on numbers alone. They move on the story investors tell about those numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The usual narratives look like this:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Demand is weakening</li> <li>Pricing power is fading</li> <li>Costs are rising</li> <li>Debt is becoming a headwind</li> <li>A major shift is underway</li> <li>A disruptive event hit the business</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Your job is to connect the dots between the numbers and the story. Not to find a comforting explanation - just the most accurate one.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 6: Read CEO Comments Like a Human, Not Like a Fan</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management commentary matters because tone changes before numbers do.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Listen for:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Are they confident and specific - or vague and defensive?</li> <li>Are they taking action - or blaming external forces?</li> <li>Are they raising guidance, maintaining it, or quietly walking it back?</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A great CEO doesn’t promise perfection. They explain what they control, what they don’t, and what they’re doing next.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 7: Check the News, but Filter for Relevance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sometimes the stock is down for reasons that have nothing to do with that company:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Rate moves hit utilities and REITs</li> <li>A sector selloff hits everything in the group</li> <li>A macro scare triggers a market-wide risk-off mood</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The question isn’t “What’s the headline?” It’s:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Is this company-specific or environment-driven?</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That distinction changes your decision.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 8: Expectations Can Be Brutal</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sometimes the market is simply too demanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is where investors get confused: the company reports strong results... and the stock still gets punished.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A perfect example was Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>). After earnings, the stock dropped more than 10% even though it delivered revenue growth of 17%, cloud growth of 29%, and an EPS increase of 24%. Apparently, that wasn’t “good enough.” The issue wasn’t the quarter - it was <em>expectations</em>, valuation, and investor nerves around massive AI capex and when the payoff shows up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I explained that whole setup in my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872805-volatility-starting-year-january-2026-dividend-income-report\">January Dividend Income Report</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s the lesson: stocks don’t fall only because results are bad. They fall because results are less impressive than what the market already priced in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When a stock is down, you’re not hunting for a quick explanation. You’re running a process that leads to one of three outcomes:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The business is fine. The price is noisy.</li> <li>The business has a real issue, but it looks fixable.</li> <li>The story is deteriorating and the dividend triangle is cracking.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And here’s the part that brings it all together:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reasons you buy a stock are often the same reasons you eventually sell it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When the core drivers break, the thesis breaks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://thedividendguyblog.com/why-is-it-down-the-investor-question-that-never-goes-away/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

More specifically, my last <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4769029-bhp-group-better-than-vale-if-you-really-want-mining-exposure\">BHP<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> article</span></a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> was published on Mar 20, 2025, and my last </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4778569-rio-tinto-vs-vale-inventory-doesnt-lie\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">RIO article</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> was published on April 27, 2025. Both articles focused on the tariff risks at that point. I gave both stocks a Hold rating due to my outlook for the tariff uncertainties to translate into near-term demand and pricing headwinds for raw materials. Since then, much has changed both in terms of company specifics and macroeconomics. In terms of company specifics, both have released updated earnings reports and new EPS guidance. In terms of macroeconomics, the geopolitical uncertainties and ore prices have also changed considerably.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With these changes, the investment thesis for this follow-up is twofold. First, I will explain why these changes have made both BHP and RIO stocks timely candidates for Ray Dalio’s AWP (All-weather portfolio). Due to their commodity exposure, including these miners in a portfolio can help to hedge against structural shifts in the global economy, particularly inflation. Second, I will argue why between these two mining leaders, BHP emerges as the even better candidate due to its superior operational margins, and also stronger financial strength. These considerations have led me to update my rating on BHP to Buy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">BHP, RIO, and commodity cycles</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Readers following our approach know that our foundational investing strategy is heavily influenced by Ray Dalio’s thinking. In particular, his AWP framework is designed to perform across all four economic regimes during a macroscopic cycle. Commodities specifically target the rising prices regime featuring elevated inflation. Judging by the changes in commodity prices since my last writings, leadings miners such as BHP and RIO appear very timely under the AWP framework. To wit, the chart below displays the price of global price of iron ore, a major product that is substantial profit stream for both BHP and RIO stocks. Before going into any details, let me first point out the notorious volatilities and cyclicality the prices have demonstrated in its latest boom and bust cycle as shown. In the past 10 years, the price has more than quadrupled (from around $40 per metric ton in 2016 to ~$220 in 2021) and then approximately halved since the 2021 peak.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this overall observation, let’s now focus more on the details in the past 1 year or so. As seen, shortly since my last writings, the ore prices have indeed suffered downward pressure and reached a bottom of around $96 per ton in mid-2025. Since then, the prices have recovered by quite a bit to the current level of $107, an increase of more than 11%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242746452308_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1824\" data-height=\"973\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242746452308_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"341\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242746452308_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242746452308_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242746452308_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242746452308_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With these changes, my assessment is that the contracting phase of the commodity cycle (that started between 2021 and 2022) has largely run its course already. As such, I expect the ore prices to remain stable and should start the recovery phase in the near future. As a reflection, the profit margins of both companies have demonstrated improvements since my last articles as shown in the chart below. In particular, BHP’s gross margin has expanded to 83.09% with the updated financials in its latest earnings report, which started to exceed its 5-year average of 82.2%. From this chart, you can also see the first reason that makes BHP a better fit for the AWP. BHP has demonstrated superior profitability over RIO on most metrics ranging from gross margin, net margin, FCF margin, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270404833_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"935\" data-height=\"446\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270404833_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"305\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270404833_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270404833_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270404833_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270404833_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">BHP and RIO: balance sheet in focus</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For businesses with exposure to highly cyclical earnings, I especially prefer those with a more conservative balanced sheet in general. On this front, BHP is certainly the more favorable candidate for me. To start, BHP features a much higher holistic Altman Z score than RIO. For investors unfamiliar with the concept, the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/altman.asp#:~:text=The%20Altman%20Z%2Dscore%20is%20a%20formula%20for%20determining%20whether,%2C%20solvency%2C%20and%20activity%20ratios.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Altman Z-score</a> is a metric that captures the overall financial strength of a business by factoring multiple parameters across all the financial statements. As a rule of thumb, I like to see a score of 3 or above for businesses with cyclical behavior such as BHP and RIO. The Altman Z scores of for BHP are above this threshold (3.03 per its latest financials), while the for RIO fell a bit short (2.46).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270408985_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"968\" data-height=\"250\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270408985_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"165\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270408985_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270408985_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270408985_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270408985_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After seeing the forest, let’s examine a tree more closely. The next chart shows BHP and RIO stock's current and historical interest coverage. As seen, BHP Group has demonstrated far safer coverage than RIO in recent years. To wit, its Times Interest Earned ratio climbed from a mid-2024 low of approximately 16x to the current level of more than 25x. Conversely, Rio Tinto’s coverage has deteriorated significantly over the same period, falling from around 18x in mid-2024 to about 13x presently, only about half of BHP’s coverage ratio. With these contrasts, I see BHP in a much better position to reinvest in growth and weather headwinds (such as interest rate risks and commodity price risks).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242705200164_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1308\" data-height=\"484\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242705200164_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"char\" width=\"640\" height=\"237\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242705200164_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242705200164_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242705200164_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242705200164_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">BHP and RIO: valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of valuation, RIO is certainly the more attractive one on this front. To wit, the data below shows BHP’s valuation premium over RIO on several earnings-based metrics. For example, BHP’s Non-GAAP P/E for the current fiscal year stands at 16.66, which is significantly higher than Rio Tinto’s P/E of 11.91 by about 40%. This trend continues into the future fiscal years too.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, my view is that BHP’s valuation is not as expensive as headline P/E ratios suggest relative to RIO due to the differences in profitability metrics and also balance sheets as analyzed above. Higher profitability margins tend to lead into better earing-cash conversion. As a result, BHP’s Price/Cash Flow ratio is about 10.35 only. It is not only far below its P/E ratio but also not that higher when compared to Rio Tinto’s 9.76. The difference is about 7% only, in contrast to the 40% difference in P/E ratios. Further, due to BHP’s better balance sheet strength, EV-based valuation metrics also show a much tighter spread. For example, BHP’s trailing EV/EBITDA is actually lower at 8.61 compared to Rio Tinto’s 9.32.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242704424622_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"902\" data-height=\"307\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242704424622_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"218\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242704424622_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242704424622_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242704424622_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242704424622_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other risks and final thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before closing, let me articulate that I am NOT trying to argue that RIO is a bad choice. It is a strong candidate in itself (and hence my reiterated Hold rating). Besides its attractive valuation metrics and also leading position, it also offers a few key differentiate catalysts in my view. To start, Rio Tinto has a large exposure (or even dominance in my view) in the aluminum sector. Besides offering a diversified, this exposure could also offer a hedge against energy cost rises as aluminum production is extremely energy-intensive and Rio Tinto has developed substantially integrated power assets. Additionally, Rio Tinto and Amazon AWS have recently <a href=\"https://www.riotinto.com/en/news/releases/2026/rio-tinto-and-amazon-web-services-collaborate-to-bring-low-carbon-nuton-copper-to-u-s--data-centres\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> a collaboration to bring low-carbon Nuton copper to U.S. data centers (see more details quoted below). I see large odds for this collation to expand with AMZN’s aggressive CAPAX plan in the years ahead.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>TUCSON, Ariz. (Jan 15, 2026): Rio Tinto today announces a strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) that will see AWS become Nuton® Technology’s first customer following the breakthrough industrial-scale deployment of the innovative bioleaching technology at the Johnson Camp copper mine in the U.S. last month.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To close, this reexamination of BHP and RIO is motivated by changes both in terms of company specifics and macroeconomics since my last writings about a year ago. Changes in the former bucket include their updated earnings reports, profit metrics, and valuation ratios. Changes in the latter bucket include ore prices and my assessment of the commodity cycle. These changes have made BHP and RIO stocks both interesting candidates for Ray Dalio’s AWP idea.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see BHP as the even better candidate due to its superior margins and stronger balance sheet. Furthermore, its valuation premium relative to RIO is not as large as on the surface. For these considerations, this reexamining concludes with an upgraded rating on BHP to Buy.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The fund does reasonably well in this task, as it boasts an<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> 11.49% yield at the current share price, which is significantly higher than most other assets in the market possess. However, as is the case with all of the closed-end funds currently offered by DoubleLine, DSL achieves its objectives primarily by investing its assets into a portfolio comprised of bonds. Bonds only offer extremely limited upside when compared to common stocks, which is due to the simple fact that bonds are both issued and redeemed at their face values, so they offer no net capital gains when held over their lifetimes. As a result of this, investors in this fund should not expect to earn much beyond the distribution. Indeed, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund has delivered no share price appreciation over the past ten years, and all of the returns that it has provided to its investors have come from the distribution. With that said, though, given the fact that this fund has a substantially higher yield than any of the benchmark bond indices, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund should offer superior total returns to any exchange-traded index fund that tracks a bond index.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund Versus Bond Index Funds</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As mentioned in the introduction, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund primarily invests its assets in bonds and similar fixed-income securities. The fund’s <a href=\"https://doubleline.com/funds/income-solutions-fund/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a> states:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The Fund will seek to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a portfolio of investments selected for their potential to provide high current income, growth of capital, or both. The Fund may invest in debt securities and other income-producing investments anywhere in the world, including emerging markets.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This quote explicitly states that one thing that the fund’s management is looking for is an asset’s ability to provide growth of capital. As was mentioned in the introduction, most bonds are incapable of doing this as they are issued at face value and return the face value to their owners whenever the bond matures. As such, anyone who purchases a bond when it is first issued and holds it until it matures will have absolutely no growth of capital. Furthermore, anyone who purchases a bond at a price that is above its face value is actually guaranteed to have a negative growth of capital. It is not uncommon for bonds to trade at prices above their face values during periods of time in which interest rates are extraordinarily low. In fact, bonds will usually trade above their face values whenever the coupon rate on the bond is higher than what the same bond would have if it were issued today. Over the past fifteen years, market interest rates have typically been lower than they are today. However, prior to the financial crisis of 2008, bond yields were typically higher than during the period that followed it. As such, it has been extremely difficult, if not impossible, to actually achieve growth of capital from most bonds over the past few decades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, there are two types of bonds that can deliver growth of capital over their lifetimes. These two types are:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><span>Convertible bonds, if the bond is converted into common stock prior to its maturity date,</span></li> <li><span>Bonds that have a face value denominated in a currency that is different from the investor’s own home currency.</span></li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>It is arguable whether the second type of bond is truly delivering growth of capital. This is because the bond’s gain comes from the investor’s home currency declining against the currency in which the bond is denominated. The bond itself did not actually deliver any increase in value because it still returns the same amount that was actually lent. All that has changed is that the investor’s home currency is worth less.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund does not have any convertible bonds in its portfolio.

As such, it is not using this particular asset class to generate growth of capital. It is also unlikely that the small allocation to common stocks will deliver any meaningful growth, given the companies that the fund is invested in:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699381001644_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1878\" data-height=\"514\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699381001644_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL Common Stock Holdings Dec. 31 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"175\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699381001644_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699381001644_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699381001644_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699381001644_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DSL Q1 2026 Holdings Report</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Whenever a company goes bankrupt, it will sometimes convert its outstanding debt into common stock and issue this stock to the bondholders. It seems highly likely that DSL obtained its common stock positions via this method, given that several of these firms are not publicly traded and went through bankruptcy proceedings in past years. Thus, these are not so much investments as they are common stocks that the fund simply received along the way and now has no reason to sell (or is unable to sell) for whatever reason.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund does, however, have relatively high exposure to foreign bonds. We can see that, as of December 31, 2025, fully 48.4% of the fund’s assets were invested in either foreign corporate bonds or foreign government bonds. This does not necessarily mean that these bonds are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, however. It is not uncommon for a company or a country to issue bonds denominated in U.S. dollars. In fact, this is very common among those entities that are based in emerging markets due to the simple fact that many international investors do not trust emerging market currencies. As such, the fund’s exposure to non-U.S. dollar-denominated bonds is likely lower than the 48.4% of net assets that the asset allocation chart suggests. The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund, unfortunately, does not explicitly state what its foreign currency exposure actually is. However, given that the fund did have $37,305,132 (2.7% of net assets) invested in the DoubleLine Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DBELX\" title=\"DoubleLine Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond I\">DBELX</a>) as of December 31, 2025, it does have some foreign currency exposure. We just do not know exactly how much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the above chart shows, the portfolio of the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund essentially resembles that of a global bond fund. As such, it would be most appropriate to compare the fund to global bond indices. This chart clearly shows that the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund has a substantially better yield than any of the main American or global bond indices:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Index/ETF</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Current Yield</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AGG\" title=\"iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF\">AGG</a>)</p></td> <td><p>3.85%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Bloomberg High Yield Very Liquid Index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNK\" title=\"State Street SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF\">JNK</a>)</p></td> <td><p>6.54%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Vanguard Total World Bond ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BNDW\" title=\"Vanguard Total World Bond ETF\">BNDW</a>)</p></td> <td><p>4.08%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BNDX\" title=\"Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund ETF\">BNDX</a>)</p></td> <td><p>4.35%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>J.P.

This particular index tracks the price and yield performance of speculative-grade bonds issued by corporations in the United States. In other words, it tracks the price and yield performance of bonds in which the issuer is considered to have a high risk of defaulting on the bond. <a href=\"https://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/401/junk.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">According to Moody’s</a>, a BB-rated junk bond has a 1.5% chance of defaulting in any given year, and a B-rated junk bond has a 7% chance of defaulting in any given year. Naturally, whenever a bond issuer defaults, bond investors frequently lose all of the money that they invested in the bond. Despite the relatively high default risk, the American junk bond index only yields 6.54% at the current level. It is arguable whether or not this is actually high enough to compensate investors for the risk of loss here. After all, the yield of the junk bond index is only 2.69% higher than the yield of the investment-grade bond index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AGG\" title=\"iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF\">AGG</a>), which consists of bonds that have a substantially lower risk of default.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As mentioned in the introduction, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund has a yield of 11.49% at the current share price, so it is substantially higher than that of the American junk bond index. It is unclear whether or not the fund invests in riskier assets than those included in the index in order to achieve this outcome. The fund’s website provides the following breakdown of the credit quality of the bonds that comprise its portfolio:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699389006011.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL Holdings by Credit Quality\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"619\" height=\"660\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699389006011.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699389006011.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699389006011.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DoubleLine</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of January 31, 2026, the fund had 74.12% of its total assets invested in speculative-grade bonds.

Thus, any index fund that tracks the Bloomberg High Yield Very Liquid Index will have 100% of its assets invested in junk bonds. That is a much higher allocation than DSL currently has.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the website for the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund does not break its assets down further than shown above. The website does not, for example, specify what proportion of the fund’s holdings consist of CAA1 and CAA2 bonds. It is possible that the junk bonds in the fund’s portfolio consist of the riskiest (and therefore highest-yielding) junk bonds on the market, while the JNK ETF only has a relatively small allocation to those bonds. Thus, unless DoubleLine provides a breakdown of the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund by the specific letter grades of the securities in the portfolio, we cannot be certain whether or not DSL is taking on greater risks than the index funds in order to achieve a higher yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, one thing that we can be sure of is that the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund is using leverage as a method of boosting the effective yield that it earns from its net assets. The way that this works is that the fund borrows money and then uses the money that it borrows to buy bonds and similar debt securities. It then uses the coupons that it receives from these purchased securities to pay the interest on the borrowed money. If the bonds that the fund purchased pay more than is necessary to cover the interest on the fund’s debt, the fund is allowed to keep the surplus money. This ultimately results in the yield that the fund receives as a percentage of its net assets being higher than it would be if the fund did not use leverage. The fund’s most recent holdings report states that the fund’s portfolio consisted of securities that were worth $1,748,727,149 on December 31, 2025. However, the fund also had $388,984,550 in debt that it owed on that date. The net assets were only $1,359,742,599, but it collects coupon payments on the $1.7 billion amount. Thus, the fund’s income should actually be higher than it would be if the only assets that it controlled were the ones that were purchased with its net assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most recent <a href=\"https://pex.broadridge.com/summary.asp?doctype=ann&amp;cid=dbline&amp;fid=258622109\" rel=\"nofollow\">financial statements</a> for the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund reinforce this conclusion. For the twelve-month period that ended on September 30, 2025, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund received an income of $159,818,963 from the assets in its portfolio. This is an 11.28% yield on the fund’s average net assets of $1,416,805,329 over the period. This is clearly higher than any of the bond indices provide, and indeed, it is higher than just about any individual bonds provide. Thus, we can clearly see that the fund’s leverage is providing a boost to the effective yield that it earns from its net assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As was already noted, bonds deliver essentially all of their total returns through direct payments that they make to their investors. As such, for the most part, higher yields translate into higher total returns. This is true for many bond funds as well, not just for individual bonds. As the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund has a higher yield than any of the indices, we would therefore expect it to offer higher total returns than index funds tracking the major American or global bond indices. Indeed, this is what we see, as clearly shown here:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699272076936_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1195\" data-height=\"413\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699272076936_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL vs Indices 10-Yr.

As is clearly shown, the fund managed to outperform all of the indices by a considerable margin. However, please note that the above chart assumes that an investor used the distributions that were paid out by each of these funds to purchase additional shares on the distribution payment date. This may not be a realistic assumption for bond investors, though, as many of those individuals who actually invest in bonds would prefer to take the distributions as cash.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, however, investors who actually take this fund’s distributions as cash end up disappointed. Over the past ten years, the share price of the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund declined by 29.42%.

However, the fact that the fund’s share price declined by almost 30% suggests that the fund has not consistently covered the distributions that it pays out. After all, the share price of a closed-end fund typically correlates with its net asset value (although it is not as precise of a correlation as an exchange-traded fund experiences).

The fact that the fund’s net asset value declined over the period means that the fund did not manage to cover its distributions over the period. While this is certainly concerning, it is worth noting that the fund cut its distribution in late 2020 following the losses that it suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, most of the net asset value decline was due to the fund continuing to pay out distributions throughout 2020 despite the massive sell-off of bonds in March, as well as the increase in interest rates during 2022. The bond market stabilized somewhat beginning in 2023, and the fund has done a better job maintaining its distribution since that time:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699291123552_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1190\" data-height=\"418\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699291123552_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL vs NAV 3-Yr.

Indeed, the fund’s net asset value is down over the period. As such, investors may want to use caution when considering purchasing shares of the fund.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund Versus Other Bond CEFs</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As was just discussed, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund is able to employ certain strategies that allow it to earn a higher level of income and boast a higher yield than most bond index funds. This is not the only fund on the market that is able to use similar strategies, however. In fact, many closed-end bond funds are able to do so, and as a result, they are able to be much more competitive in terms of yield. We can see that here:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Fund Name</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Morningstar Classification</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Current Yield</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>11.49%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>BrandywineGLOBAL – Global Income Opportunities Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BWG\" title=\"BrandywineGLOBAL - Global Income Opptys Fd Inc\">BWG</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>11.51%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>MFS Multimarket Income Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MMT\" title=\"MFS Multimarket Income Trust\">MMT</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>8.65%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Nuveen Global High Income Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JGH\" title=\"Nuveen Global High Income Fund\">JGH</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>9.76%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>PIMCO Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PDO\" title=\"PIMCO Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund\">PDO</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>11.00%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Putnam Premier Income Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PPT\" title=\"Putnam Premier Income Trust\">PPT</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>8.60%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Western Asset Global Corporate Defined Opportunity Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GDO\" title=\"Western Asset Global Corporate Opportunity Fd Inc.\">GDO</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>12.86%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>abrdn Global Income Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCO\" title=\"abrdn Global Income Fund Inc\">FCO</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>26.17%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The median yield of this group of eight closed-end funds is 11.25%, which is slightly below the yield of the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund. Thus, the yield of this fund should seem fairly reasonable to many income investors. We can see, however, that DSL also does not have the highest yield in the peer group. At its current level, its yield is only slightly above that of the median fund in the group. There are a number of funds with higher yields and thus a number of funds that will provide their investors with a higher level of income. Many income-seeking investors might be inclined to seek out other options given this. However, the fact that this fund does not have a particularly outsized yield relative to its peers suggests that the market is not pricing in a distribution cut. If it were, then the fund’s yield would be well above the median, as is the case with the abrdn Global Income Fund. As one of the things that we look for as income investors is a sustainable income, the fact that the market does not seem to expect a distribution cut is an attractive characteristic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The correlation between yield and total return that we saw in the previous section does not necessarily apply when considering closed-end funds. As we can see here, the funds with the highest yields do not have the highest total returns over the trailing ten-year period:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Fund Name</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Trailing Ten-Year Total Return</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund</p></td> <td><p>97.04%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>BrandywineGLOBAL – Global Income Opportunities Fund</p></td> <td><p>85.08%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>MFS Multimarket Income Trust</p></td> <td><p>95.52%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Nuveen Global High Income Fund</p></td> <td><p>142.76%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>PIMCO Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund</p></td> <td><p>n/a</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Putnam Premier Income Trust</p></td> <td><p>66.40%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Western Asset Global Corporate Defined Opportunity Fund</p></td> <td><p>68.53%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>abrdn Global Income Fund</p></td> <td><p>43.40%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The highest-yielding funds in this peer group are GDO and FCO, and we can clearly see that they were not the best funds to own in terms of total return. There is a reason for this, and it comes down to the fact that a closed-end fund can overdistribute. While it is generally not a good idea for a closed-end fund that is intended to last for perpetuity (as most of them are) to pay out more than its investment profits, there are no legal restrictions that forbid them from doing so. Indeed, a closed-end fund can technically pay out as much money as it wants to until its net asset value reaches zero. This seems to be the policy of the abrdn Global Income Fund, as its net asset value has been consistently declining over the past ten years:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699297253358_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1196\" data-height=\"409\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699297253358_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FCO NAV 10-Yr.

As we already saw, this was worse than the net asset value decline suffered by the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund over the same period. Indeed, it is substantially worse. The cause of this is that the fund is distributing significantly more than it earns from its assets and destroying its net asset value in the process. As the fund’s net asset value declines, its share price also declines, and this decline in the share price offsets the high yield. As such, it is usually best to stick with a fund that is at least trying to keep its distributions in line with its investment profits. The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund does much better here, although it was not the best fund overall over the past ten years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recent Performance Update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We last <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800500-dsl-this-popular-bond-fund-is-destroying-purchasing-power\">discussed</a> the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund on July 10, 2025. As such, approximately seven-and-a-half months have passed since the last time that we looked at this fund. As we all know, many things can happen over a seven-month period. That was certainly the case with this one, and as such, there are a few things that we should discuss to understand the performance of this fund since that time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the most important things that occurred over the past seven months that had an impact on bonds and bond prices is the resumption of the Federal Reserve’s attempts to ease monetary policy. This came in the form of three 25-basis point cuts to the federal funds target rate, which occurred in September, October, and December:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699303455665_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1654\" data-height=\"608\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699303455665_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EFFR Article-to-Article Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"235\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699303455665_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699303455665_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699303455665_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699303455665_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The effective federal funds rate was 4.33% the last time that we reviewed the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund. Today, it is at 3.64%, or 69 basis points below the July level. This is in line with the 75-basis points of cuts to the federal funds target rate, although the central bank did not manage to force the federal funds rate down by the entire 75 basis points. The current effective federal funds rate is in the target range, however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We should note that the Federal Reserve only directly controls short-term interest rates. Long-term interest rates, such as those paid by most bonds, are not under the direct control of the nation’s central bank. This is why we can sometimes get situations such as what happened at the end of 2024, when the yields on long-term bonds rose despite the Federal Reserve reducing its benchmark federal funds target rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It was a bit of a different story in the current period, however. As was just mentioned, the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark federal funds target rate by 75 basis points since July. This did not cause the interest rate on long-term bonds to rise as it did back in 2024. Rather, the coupon yields on long-term bonds declined in response to this event, although they did not decline by nearly as much as the federal funds rate did. We can see this here:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Bond Term</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Yield on July 10, 2025</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Yield Today</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Ten-Year</p></td> <td><p>4.35%</p></td> <td><p>4.02%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Twenty-Year</p></td> <td><p>4.87%</p></td> <td><p>4.60%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Thirty-Year</p></td> <td><p>4.86%</p></td> <td><p>4.67%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the purposes of this chart, I used the yield of U.S. Treasury securities of the specified term at the close of the market on the date mentioned. Corporate bond yields will be higher, but U.S. Treasuries generally give a pretty good idea of what the rest of the bond market is doing. As we can see, long-term U.S. Treasury yields have only declined by 19 to 33 basis points, depending on the term. This is far less than the decline in short-term yields that occurred over the period. As such, the yield curve has steepened.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bond funds such as the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund mostly invest in notes and bonds, rather than in ultra-short-term bills. As we can see here, over half of the bonds held in DSL’s portfolio have maturity dates that are between 3 years and 5 years into the future:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699312327642.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL Maturity Date Schedule Across Portfolio\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"593\" height=\"644\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699312327642.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699312327642.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699312327642.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DoubleLine</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the yield curve has steepened, the bonds in the fund’s portfolio may not have seen their yields decline as much as would ordinarily be assumed, given 75 basis points of cuts by the Federal Reserve.

As such, caution may be recommended, as situations such as this could very easily result in a distribution cut if the fund’s management cannot correct this problem.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even if we take the fund’s distributions into account, the DoubleLine Income Solution Fund substantially underperformed the bond indices:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-1772169933350722_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"413\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-1772169933350722_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL vs Indices Total Return Article-to-Article Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"220\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-1772169933350722_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-1772169933350722_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-1772169933350722_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-1772169933350722_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fortunately, we do see that the fund managed to deliver a positive total return over the period. The distributions that it paid out over the period were greater than the decline in the share price. However, investors still would have been better off with any of the index funds. The emerging market bond index fund, in particular, did very well, which may have been partly due to the fact that emerging markets in general have <a href=\"https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/insights/emerging-market-debt-outlook-the-return-of-goldilocks\" rel=\"nofollow\">lower debt and less fiscal pressures</a> than developed countries. Emerging market debt (particularly emerging market debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar) did remarkably well in 2025, and we can see that reflected above. While the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund does have some exposure to emerging market debt, it was clearly unable to capitalize on the strength in that sector as illustrated by its performance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Forward Outlook For The Fund</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While perhaps not as common as in 2024, it is still fairly often that I see financial commentators <a href=\"https://global.morningstar.com/en-nd/bonds/why-2026-will-be-turning-point-bonds\" rel=\"nofollow\">suggest</a> that bonds will do fairly well as an asset class in 2026. The reasons for these calls usually revolve around predictions that the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates this year and that inflation will decline. However, these two drivers might not be as good for bonds as some analysts expect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One common suggestion in favor of bonds is that interest rates should come down as the Federal Reserve reduces interest rates. It is true that the Federal Reserve is expected to continue with its interest rate-cutting program that began back in 2024. Indeed, as of right now, the market believes that there is a 33.0% chance that there will be two 25-basis point cuts to the federal funds target rate by the end of this year:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699339966426_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1287\" data-height=\"690\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699339966426_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FED FUND Predictions YE2026\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"343\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699339966426_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699339966426_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699339966426_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699339966426_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, we can note in the chart above that the market believes that it is more likely that there will be three 25-basis point cuts than that there will be one cut by the end of the year. In fact, the market currently believes that there is a 59.3% chance that the federal funds target range will be cut by either 50 or 75 basis points by the end of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is an inverse correlation between interest rates and bond prices. Whenever interest rates decline, bond prices increase and vice versa. The argument for buying bonds, therefore, becomes that the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate cuts will reduce interest rates all across the yield curve and thus cause bond prices to rise. There are two problems with this thesis. The first is that interest rates on bonds do not always decline whenever the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. We saw this in the final three months of 2024. In fact, the yield of the ten-year U.S. Treasury note is higher today than it was on September 16, 2024. The reason that I chose that date is that it was the day before the Federal Open Market Committee met and made the decision to cut the federal funds target rate by 50 basis points (the first rate cut of the current cycle). On September 16, 2024, the ten-year U.S. Treasury note closed at 3.63%. Today, the ten-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.02%, despite the federal funds target rate being 175 basis points lower than it was in early September 2024. Thus, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve do not always lower the interest rates on bonds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second reason why the thesis about interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve is flawed is that the market is forward-looking. As we have just seen, the market currently expects the central bank to reduce the federal funds rate by 50 to 75 basis points this year. That expectation is already priced into bonds. Thus, if the Federal Reserve simply fulfills the market’s expectations, it is unlikely to move bond prices by very much. Therefore, any bond market profits that are likely to be made by 50 to 75 basis points of cuts have already been made.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other part of the thesis that some analysts are making in favor of bonds is that inflation is coming down and will continue to do so. However, it is unclear whether or not inflation is actually coming down. On February 20, 2026, the Bureau of Economic Analysis <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/news/2026/personal-income-and-outlays-december-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">released</a> its personal consumption expenditures index for the month of December 2025. This report showed that this index increased by 2.9% year-over-year. That is higher than in any of the past four months:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699345924413.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PCE Inflation Rate 4-Mo.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"537\" height=\"182\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699345924413.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699345924413.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699345924413.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bureau of Economic Analysis</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, that is the highest year-over-year increase in any of the past twelve months:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699349129305_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"983\" data-height=\"453\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699349129305_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PCE YoY Rate of Change 1-Yr.

The personal consumption expenditures index is generally considered to be a better indicator of the true rate of inflation than the Consumer Price Index. There are a few reasons for this, including the fact that the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index includes a broader range of goods and services consumed by individuals, and it also takes into account the price of things that are purchased by health insurance and similar products that make purchases on behalf of consumers. The Federal Reserve has historically considered the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index to be a more accurate measure of inflation, and it relies on it to make decisions about monetary policy rather than the Consumer Price Index.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, it is questionable whether or not inflation is actually coming down. The Consumer Price Index shows that it dropped in January, although it is still higher than in April 2025:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699355237284_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"978\" data-height=\"459\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699355237284_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"US CPI YoY Rate of Change 1-Yr.

Unless this trend changes and inflation quickly declines and stays down, then there is not much room for bond yields to decline. After all, investors still want to get a positive real return on their bonds. It is difficult to see any catalyst that could push inflation down and keep it down for an extended period of time, given the borrowing needs of the U.S. government.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, it is difficult to make a bullish case for bonds or bond funds right now. Most of the potential upside from interest rate cuts is already priced in, and bond yields cannot decline very much before they end up delivering negative real yields. As such, DSL seems somewhat unlikely to deliver much upside over the next twelve months.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Distribution Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The website for the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund states that the fund has the primary objective of providing its investors with a high level of current income. This makes a lot of sense for a bond fund. In accordance with this objective, the fund pays a monthly distribution of $0.1100 per share ($1.32 per share annually), which gives it an 11.49% yield at the current share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let us look at the fund’s most recent financial report, which is the annual report for the twelve-month period that ended on September 30, 2025, to see how well it is covering its distribution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the twelve-month period that ended on September 30, 2025, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund reported a net investment income of $118,096,979. That was not sufficient to cover the $149,393,545 that the fund paid out in distributions over the period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, the fund was not able to make up for the difference through capital gains. For the twelve-month period that ended on September 30, 2025, DSL reported net realized losses of $17,784,059, which were partially offset by $8,647,081 of net unrealized gains. The fund’s investment portfolio produced total returns of $108,960,001 over the period:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699361076636_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"985\" data-height=\"142\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699361076636_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL Profit from Investments\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"92\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699361076636_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699361076636_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699361076636_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699361076636_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DSL 2025 Annual Report</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That was not sufficient to cover the distributions that were paid out over the period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, though, if we look back over the past two years, the fund did manage to cover its distributions.

Thus, it did manage to cover its distributions over the past two years. However, we can still see that the fund had to rely on its net unrealized gains to accomplish this. That could be problematic given that bonds always pay their face value at maturity (regardless of what the fund paid to get them) and unrealized gains are not necessarily permanent. As such, investors might still want to keep a watchful eye on the fund’s finances and watch its net asset value closely.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares of the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund are currently trading at a 2.81% discount on net asset value. This is a slightly worse price than the 3.53% discount that the fund’s shares have had on average over the past month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund’s current price is, however, reasonably in line with its long-term average. Over the past five years, shares of DSL have traded at prices ranging from a 14.20% discount to a 3.00% premium on net asset value. The average price over the five-year period was a 2.07% discount on net asset value. That is a slightly worse price than the fund has today.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Fund Name</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Premium/(Discount)</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund</p></td> <td><p>(2.81%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>BrandywineGLOBAL – Global Income Opportunities Fund</p></td> <td><p>(8.57%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>MFS Multimarket Income Trust</p></td> <td><p>(16.07%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Nuveen Global High Income Fund</p></td> <td><p>(7.83%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>PIMCO Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund</p></td> <td><p>5.76%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Putnam Premier Income Trust</p></td> <td><p>(3.97%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Western Asset Global Corporate Defined Opportunity Fund</p></td> <td><p>(5.32%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>abrdn Global Income Fund</p></td> <td><p>12.41%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The median price out of this group of eight funds is a 4.65% discount, so we can see that the current price of DSL is a bit above the peer median level. However, given that this is historically one of the more expensive bond funds around and that it is not particularly expensive compared to its long-term average price, the current price appears reasonable.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expenses</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund’s annual report states that it had an expense ratio of 2.98% for the most recent fiscal year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In conclusion, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund is a closed-end bond fund that provides a far superior yield than that of most bond index funds. It is difficult to make a case for buying it though, given that the fund failed to cover its distribution in the most recent year and it has been suffering from falling net asset value. Furthermore, it is difficult to make a case for buying bonds in the current environment, given that interest rate cuts are already priced in, and inflation remains high enough to limit the degree to which interest rates can decline further before real rates become negative. The fund’s price appears to be reasonable compared to its historical range, however.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

Are You Serious?</h2> <p>Wow! Before I begin to discuss the thesis for investors in Block, Inc. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XYZ\" title=\"Block, Inc.\">XYZ</a></span>), I would like to express my heartfelt sympathies to the Block employees who<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> are affected by this sweeping 40% single-day </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558343-blocks-jack-dorsey-tells-employees-why-hes-slashing-headcount-and-what-block-is-paying\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">headcount reduction</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> that CEO Jack Dorsey has decided to initiate.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There were already reported rumors of some kind of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4548789-block-may-eliminate-up-to-10-positions\">reorganization back in early February</a>. But that reported figure was supposed to be 10%, not the 40% that we have come to know as of yesterday (February 26). So it must have baffled Block employees and investors, even though the market has reacted with palpable optimism.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm not going to go into whether the market is right or wrong to lift XYZ stock by almost 20% in the pre-market as I pen this update. It is my understanding that markets are amoral and that they react to KPIs (most of the time). And because of the potential of a markedly lower cost base due to the significant reduction in headcount, not only has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875898-block-inc-xyz-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">guidance for XYZ improved</a> in the near term, but the upgrade is also pretty significant. With that, I think you can make sense of why the market reacted like what we saw after the earnings report and conference. CFO Amrita Ahuja has the insights for us:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>For Q1, we expect year-over-year gross profit growth of 22% to $2.8 billion. In addition to the growth momentum we're seeing, our guidance also reflects a smaller cost structure going forward. We believe the actions we're taking today will enable us to deliver faster product innovation for customers in the future while also enabling us to invest meaningfully in our business. With this change in cost structure, combined with the investments we plan to make, we are increasing our guidance for adjusted operating income in 2026 to $3.2 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 54% and 6 points of margin expansion relative to 2025. We are increasing our expectation for adjusted diluted EPS in 2026 to $3.66, also reflecting year-over-year growth of 54%. For Q1, we expect adjusted operating income of $600 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.67, reflecting year-over-year growth of 29% and 20%, respectively. Before wrapping up, a few additional considerations related to our guidance. Our Q1 operating income guidance includes a modest benefit from today's announcement, but we expect the organizational changes we announced today to begin to more meaningfully impact adjusted operating income in the second quarter with the full impact of our new cost structure more meaningfully improving profitability in the second half of the year. Given these timing dynamics and the pacing of investments in both risk loss and sales and marketing, we expect adjusted operating income margins to expand each quarter throughout the year from our Q1 starting point of 21%. We expect these margins to expand at a faster rate in Q3 and Q4 relative to Q2, and we expect to deliver just under 60% of our 2026 adjusted operating income guidance in the second half of the year. - <em>Block Q4 2025 earnings call.</em></p></blockquote> <p data-start=\"1137\" data-end=\"1800\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">There you go. It is not a little bit of an increase, right? We are talking about a 54% growth in adjusted EPS for 2026 and also a 54% growth in adjusted operating income, or AOI, for the same fiscal year. Note that most of the benefits will flow through to the P&amp;L in the second quarter and second half, as year-over-year growth guidance for Q1 is limited to about 20% on adjusted EPS. Hence, the market is reacting just like what we should expect the market to do. It does suggest that Block has finally moved from AI experimentation to productization successfully; otherwise, we wouldn't see it being reflected and emphasized as such by the CFO in the outlook commentary.</p> <p data-start=\"1802\" data-end=\"3330\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">And we wouldn't see that <a href=\"https://s29.q4cdn.com/628966176/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-2025-Shareholder-Letter_Block.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">Block CEO Jack Dorsey is so confident</a> that he has decided to take it upon himself to announce these far-reaching layoffs to his organization. Now you see, Jack Dorsey has always been somewhat of an engineering person, if you are familiar with his background. While he may not necessarily be the <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/newsletters/the-briefing/jack-dorsey-proves-ai-job-cut-fears-true-ellisons-win-warner?rc=3e6wgn\" rel=\"nofollow\">best manager of talent</a>, some could argue he has still been instrumental and influential in shaping narratives involving social media (he’s the co-founder of Twitter), Bitcoin (note that XYZ owns a reporting segment linked to it), and, of course, payments infrastructure.</p> <h2 data-start=\"1802\" data-end=\"3330\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Block's Two-Sided Flywheel Will Be Tested</h2> <p data-start=\"1802\" data-end=\"3330\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the latter, Block has penetrated firmly into the Gen Z consumer segment and also the SMB merchant opportunities. In other words, Block has consolidated a two-sided flywheel encompassing Cash App (consumer) and Square (merchant) in its fledgling ecosystem. Investors who have followed this company long enough before it changed its name to Block and ticker symbol to XYZ should know that back in the pandemic boom years, they also acquired Afterpay. And we all know that back then, tech companies were going after talent like nobody's business, snapping up everyone like \"hotcakes,\" as bosses were concerned whether they could hire enough people due to the implication resulting from the pandemic.</p> <p data-start=\"1802\" data-end=\"3330\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Obviously, those crazy moments are now well behind us. Employment indicators have gone tepid, even though they are not showing any distress signals right now. However, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-24/us-consumer-confidence-rises-on-stronger-views-of-economy-jobs?srnd=homepage-americas\" rel=\"nofollow\">consumer confidence</a> is still at historically low levels, despite having some respite this month based on the latest reports.</p> <p data-start=\"3332\" data-end=\"3782\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, I think there is some justification that Block could have amalgamated a pretty sizeable headcount base that may not truly reflect the current era where AI could fundamentally alter the growth curve of its earnings projections. Let's not forget that the market has not been truly convinced about its investor day goals yet. Because if the market has full confidence in those targets, then why is XYZ still &gt;80% below its pandemic-era highs when calculated from its recent bottom?</p> <p data-start=\"3784\" data-end=\"4265\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course we could point out that this situation is not unique to Block. In the fintech space, we have seen how PayPal (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PYPL\" title=\"PayPal Holdings, Inc.\">PYPL</a>) has also suffered immensely at the hands of the shareholder class. PayPal also owns a two-sided network, but it probably hasn’t executed as well as XYZ in the merchant space. I guess that's why, when it comes to e-commerce, it has not been able to make significant gains and is underperforming the market average, as <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874612-paypal-left-for-dead-but-the-buyout-narrative-changes-everything-upgrade\">I discussed in a recent PYPL update</a>.</p> <p data-start=\"4267\" data-end=\"4603\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Whereas, for Block, the current environment offers them another chance to regain the initiative and help the stock get out of its rut. The market needs more confidence, obviously beyond just headcount cuts. Nevertheless, the upgraded guidance for 2026, for now, shows that the company has a viable pathway to reaching its 2028 commitments.</p> <p data-start=\"4605\" data-end=\"4855\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">In July last year, in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802172-block-rally-not-finished-yet-do-not-bail-now\">my previous update on Block</a>, I thought that the slide in the stock could come to an end. However, this proved to be premature, as the challenges that have affected fintech companies like Block persisted through the rest of 2025.</p> <h2 data-start=\"4605\" data-end=\"4855\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Block: Growth Reacceleration In The Works</h2> <p data-start=\"4605\" data-end=\"4855\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721920203746235.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Block 2025 gross profit\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"Block 2025 gross profit\" data-source=\"Block\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721920203746235.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721920203746235.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721920203746235.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721920203746235.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\">Block 2025 gross profit <span>(Block)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p data-start=\"4605\" data-end=\"4855\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p data-start=\"4857\" data-end=\"5833\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the positive takeaway from the 2025 numbers is that the company is still fundamentally strong. It's already profitable, and it has integrated its diverse segments well, benefiting from the two-sided flywheel that I discussed earlier. This network effect has obviously gained traction even though the growth rates have slowed tremendously.</p> <p data-start=\"4857\" data-end=\"5833\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we can see from the above chart, Block is now no longer considered a high-growth play. There are enough profitable companies out there outside the fintech space that are growing their profits above 20%. You can find them easily in the semiconductor space or even among the suppliers to the chip designers, as they supply the picks and shovels and the plumbing to help build out the AI infrastructure. And since we are still in the earlier stages of this multi-trillion-dollar phase, I believe management could also be concerned about when they will get that re-rating opportunity that could see the valuation return to a higher level.</p> <p data-start=\"5835\" data-end=\"6504\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because it's important for us to understand that fintech companies are not your typical value or income stock in the financial sector. Value investors are not going to pay the current premium (17x forward earnings, as compared to financial media of &lt;11x) attached to XYZ even before yesterday's post-earnings spike. These investors should very much prefer more stable big banking earnings predictability, as well as the dividend income that comes with their P&amp;L, that are less susceptible to business cycle risks that could affect XYZ more significantly than the rest. After all, like I mentioned earlier, the company has a bigger exposure to the more vulnerable class in the consumer and merchant business.</p> <p data-start=\"5835\" data-end=\"6504\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-1772192171880085.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Block guidance\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"Block guidance\" data-source=\"Block\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-1772192171880085.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-1772192171880085.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-1772192171880085.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-1772192171880085.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\">Block guidance <span>(Block)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p data-start=\"5835\" data-end=\"6504\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p data-start=\"6506\" data-end=\"7032\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, I believe management must come out with something disruptive on their own to re-energize shareholders and potential growth investors to come back to its bullish narrative. And if you can put up guidance that suggests more than 50% growth in adjusted earnings, now that's something to get people’s attention, right? It certainly also got my attention, because if you look at the 2026 guidance, it suggests that gross profit growth could now be re-accelerating and laying a clearer pathway to reaching the 2028 imperatives.</p> <p data-start=\"7034\" data-end=\"7452\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's important right now is that management has a lower OpEx base to work with, even though this is predicated very much on the success of its AI initiatives. It remains to be seen whether these are indeed transformational for the company, but I guess Block is astutely leveraging the zeitgeist that has made Claude Code the dominant media narrative and headlines in the past month, and particularly so this week.</p> <p data-start=\"7454\" data-end=\"7750\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">For a stock that was valued at just under 17x forward earnings before the run-up, it is very below the S&amp;P 500’s 21.4x forward earnings. In other words, there is much for XYZ to be re-rated if it manages to use the current organizational restructuring to drive constructive earnings growth.</p> <p data-start=\"7752\" data-end=\"8160\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jack Dorsey was clearly generous with his words, as he wanted to use the opportunity to emphasize how deeply the company has integrated AI into its workflows, suggesting that this project has been an ongoing and multi-year initiative. So the 40% headcount reduction should not be construed as something it came up with at the last minute, given the current flux that we have in fintech on the street right now.</p> <p data-start=\"8162\" data-end=\"9316\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dorsey’s commentary suggests to me that we could see an even tighter integration on its network and peer-to-peer capabilities. Therefore, it is not only going to be just the merchant side, but also the consumer side. This should drive improved operating leverage. As he explained, Block could \"personalize\" the products and services, which has the potential to improve the attach rates on its software integration, which is actually where Block really makes most of its money.</p> <p data-start=\"8162\" data-end=\"9316\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">And so they have this dual-pronged approach in circulating the consumer and merchant flywheel to deliver a higher value proposition through a \"better understanding of Block’s customers.\" I think the traction is really still very much uncertain in the current context. So I expect management to provide us more salient updates on how these AI initiatives could propel it closer to its 2028 goals. While investors have bid up the stock in view of the optimistic outlook, moving forward they will definitely want to see execution and clarity from the AI productization to be convinced that a longer time recovery could be taken as the norm and not the exception.</p> <h2 data-start=\"8162\" data-end=\"9316\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Buy Or Sell XYZ Stock?</h2> <p data-start=\"8162\" data-end=\"9316\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721923701022832.png?io=w640\" alt=\"XYZ price chart (long-term, monthly)\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"XYZ price chart (long-term, monthly)\" data-source=\"TradingView\" width=\"640\" height=\"418\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721923701022832.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721923701022832.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721923701022832.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721923701022832.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\">XYZ price chart (long-term, monthly) <span>(TradingView)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p data-start=\"8162\" data-end=\"9316\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p data-start=\"9318\" data-end=\"10640\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Okay, I guess you can see that XYZ has been moving in a pretty predictable consolidation zone between the $45 level and the $80 level. With the pre-market prices moving the stock back up to the $65 zone, the situation has arguably stabilized, which should reduce the chances of seeing it fall back toward the February lows.</p> <p data-start=\"9318\" data-end=\"10640\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">And since the $45 level has almost been tested twice, I don't expect the stock to drop below that level. Yet I also don't find enough longer-term catalysts after this current surge as the market attempts to price in the near-term benefits from a lower cost base, attributed to the organizational restructuring.</p> <p data-start=\"9318\" data-end=\"10640\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving from here, investors will likely press management for more answers on how it intends to execute such a massive reduction in its employee count. Without that level of certainty, it's challenging to envisage how Block could attract more buyers back as the valuation normalizes closer to the S&amp;P 500 average.</p> <p data-start=\"9318\" data-end=\"10640\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, the ongoing economic uncertainties and weak consumer confidence levels could continue to weigh on its buying sentiments through the rest of 2026. And with the broad weakness in the financial sector potentially stymying efforts in elevating the bullish proposition, the coast is far from clear. This should require us to consider a larger discount to reflect these headwinds.</p> <p data-start=\"10642\" data-end=\"10669\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rating: Downgrade XYZ to Hold.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
