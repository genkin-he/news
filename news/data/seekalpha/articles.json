Impacted by the high-interest rate environment, OMC has been going through massive changes, which I think will benefit the company long-term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the price rally after their buyback announcement, the advertising giant still trades at less than 8x earnings, presenting an attractive buying opportunity for long-term investors. You also get paid an attractive yield of over 4% while you wait.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the current price, I believe Omnicom Group is a great value play that's likely to see at least $100 per share by the end of 2026. In this article, I discuss their latest earnings, fundamentals, and why I believe this stock is a bargain at the current price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Previous Buy Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I last covered Omnicom Group back in October in an article titled: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831764-omnicom-group-a-cheap-ai-beneficiary-with-a-4-percent-plus-yield-and-massive-upside-potential\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831764-omnicom-group-a-cheap-ai-beneficiary-with-a-4-percent-plus-yield-and-massive-upside-potential\" target=\"_blank\"><em>A Cheap, AI Beneficiary With A 4%+ Yield &amp; Massive Upside Potential.</em></a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At a multiple of less than 10x and a yield over 4%, OMC offered strong upside to their price target of $148.65 at the end of 2027. Since then, the stock has been somewhat volatile but is up modestly since my last coverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span class=\"highlighted_text\">The S&amp;P (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" class=\"ticker-link\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" target=\"_blank\">SP500</a>) has also been volatile but is</span> up close to 2%, compared to 1.56% for OMC. During their Q3 earnings, OMC reported mixed results with a revenue miss due to declines in some of their segments. But their anticipated merger, expected to create synergies, strong balance sheet, and a well-covered dividend, were reasons I remained bullish.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-1771518878826368_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2063\" data-height=\"908\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-1771518878826368_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"282\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-1771518878826368_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-1771518878826368_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-1771518878826368_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-1771518878826368_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another Mixed Report, But Solid YoY Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Omnicom Group reported their <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871773-omnicom-group-inc-omc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871773-omnicom-group-inc-omc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">Q4 earnings</a> and saw a sizable miss on their bottom line. EPS amounted to $2.59, missing analysts' estimates by $0.35. Revenue amounted to $5.53 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the sizable miss, both EPS &amp; revenue managed to see growth year-over-year. EPS grew from $2.41 the year prior, while revenue was up from $4.32 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In total, EPS grew from $8.06 to $8.65, while their top line increased from approximately $15.7 billion to $17.3 billion. Their performance was driven by higher organic growth from the prior year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Organic growth totaled 9.3%, up from 5.2% in 2024. This was led by higher growth in their Media &amp; Advertising segment, up 14.9% compared to 7.8%. Experiential growth was up 19% compared to 15.4% last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Precision Marketing was up from 3.8% to 8.6%. Healthcare turned positive, up 2.5% vs being down 0.4% in 2025. It's likely lower base rates also played a role in OMC's performance.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715197403887718_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1026\" data-height=\"556\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715197403887718_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"347\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715197403887718_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715197403887718_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715197403887718_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715197403887718_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>OMC IP</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Omnicom also likely benefitted from the successful closing of their Interpublic Group acquisition. As part of the portfolio repositioning, OMC's management exited non-performing assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These were identified as having approximately $2.5 billion in annual revenue. And management stated they plan to exit the remaining underperforming assets in the next 12 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of the IPG acquisition, OMC closed on this 3 months ago. And previously, management stated this was expected to be accretive to their bottom line in the first year. They also mentioned this was expected to save $750 million in costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After earnings, management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553701-omnicom-doubles-synergy-target-to-1_5b-and-launches-2_5b-share-repurchase-following-ipg\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553701-omnicom-doubles-synergy-target-to-1_5b-and-launches-2_5b-share-repurchase-following-ipg\" target=\"_blank\">doubled this to $1.5 billion</a> and announced a $5 billion share repurchase program. And this caused the share price to rally. Synergies are expected over the course of the next 30 months. For 2026, they are expected to realize $900 million in cost savings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OMC also announced a $2.5 billion accelerated buyback program. And I expect management to take advantage of the share price and exhaust this in the coming quarters. As a result, this should lead to strong earnings growth, thus positively impacting the share price long-term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well-Covered 3.5% Yield</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Besides lowering costs, lower base rates should also benefit OMC as investors rotate back into the market looking for higher yields. Back in November, Omnicom Group announced a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4526383-omnicom-raises-dividend-by-143-to-080-a-share\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4526383-omnicom-raises-dividend-by-143-to-080-a-share\" target=\"_blank\">14.3% dividend increase</a> to $0.80 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was the first dividend increase since 2021. This, and their buyback program, should give investors confidence in their ability to see solid growth going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The dividend was also well-covered by cash flows. For 2025, free cash flow grew from $1.96 billion to $2.23 billion. Net free cash flow amounted to $1.677 billion, while dividends for the year amounted to roughly $550 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This gives OMC a very conservative payout ratio of 33%, and plenty of room for future acquisitions, buybacks, and dividend increases. Going forward, I suspect dividend increases to continue, likely in the high single-digit to double-digit range.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong Balance Sheet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because of the IPG acquisition, debt increased from $6 billion to $9.1 billion. As a result, leverage increased from 0.7x to 3.1x. For comparison, this was higher than both peers WPP plc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WPP\" title=\"WPP plc\">WPP</a>) and Publicis Groupe S.A. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PUBGY\" title=\"Publicis Groupe S.A.\">PUBGY</a>), whose leverage ratios were 2.0x and 1.0x, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Omnicom's net debt stood at $2.23 billion. But liquidity was robust with roughly $6.9 billion in cash &amp; cash equivalents and $3.5 billion undrawn on their revolver.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The upcoming debt was solidly staggered, with $1.4 billion due this year and a weighted-average interest rate of 3.6%. The rest of their debt was very manageable until 2030.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because of their strong financial position, I anticipate management aggressively deleveraging in 2026 and beyond. So, for those worried about the IPG acquisition and how it impacts OMC's balance sheet, the advertising giant remains in a comfortable position.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715208980456731_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"973\" data-height=\"604\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715208980456731_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"397\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715208980456731_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715208980456731_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715208980456731_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/19/54869375-17715208980456731_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>OMC IP</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Solid Growth Expected Going Forward</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Analysts anticipate solid earnings growth going forward for OMC, with a CAGR of 14% over the next 5 years. While this may be a bit optimistic, I do foresee the company averaging high single-digit to double-digit growth for the foreseeable future. And this is due to divestitures, acquisition synergies, lower base rates, and buybacks.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/54869375-17720727416053803_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1357\" data-height=\"521\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/54869375-17720727416053803_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"246\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/54869375-17720727416053803_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/54869375-17720727416053803_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/54869375-17720727416053803_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/54869375-17720727416053803_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Massive Upside Potential</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using their expected earnings of $11.14 for 2026, this gives Omnicom Group a forward P/E of just 7.42x, signaling the stock could be massively undervalued. This is also significantly below their <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OMC/valuation/metrics\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OMC/valuation/metrics\" target=\"_blank\">5-year average</a> of 11.86x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another indicator that they could be massively undervalued is their PEG ratio of just 0.47x. If the advertising giant manages to see high single-digit to double-digit growth as I expect, I see them potentially re-rating higher, likely in the 12x-15x range in the next 2 to 3 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wall Street currently has a price target of $100.50, more than 21% upside from the current price. If interest rates decline as expected and we manage to dodge a recession, I see the share price above $100 potentially by the end of the year.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/54869375-1772073020243167_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1618\" data-height=\"622\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/54869375-1772073020243167_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"246\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/54869375-1772073020243167_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/54869375-1772073020243167_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/54869375-1772073020243167_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/54869375-1772073020243167_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to F.A.S.T.

The labor market has been experiencing weakening in recent months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Due to most of their revenue coming from media &amp; advertising, the stock is highly susceptible to businesses cutting costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This makes them riskier. But at a forward P/E of less than 8x, I believe downside is minimal unless the economy takes a turn for the worse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They could also see impacts from AI down the line as businesses may use this to do their own advertising.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But Omnicom's bright outlook, well-covered 3.5% yield, robust cash flows, and suppressed share price make them a potential bargain with massive capital appreciation.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Being selective is key if you want to maximize your risk-adjusted returns, and that starts by avoiding REITs that are likely to cut their dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In what follows, I'm going to highlight three popular high-yielding REITs that I would avoid because they're at high risk of cutting their dividend in the near term:</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chiron Real Estate: Heavy Leverage and Short Debt Maturities</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chiron Real Estate (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XRN\" title=\"Chiron Real Estate Inc.\">XRN</a>) is popular among high-yield-seeking individual investors, and it's easy to understand why.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The REIT focuses on healthcare properties like medical office buildings, which benefit from the rapidly aging population and generate recession-resistant cash flows.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720988514208872_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1214\" data-height=\"598\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720988514208872_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chiron Real Estate property\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720988514208872_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720988514208872_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720988514208872_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720988514208872_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Chiron Real Estate</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It also has five years left on its leases on average, and its tenants enjoy a 4.4x rent coverage ratio, which seems to indicate that its tenants are profitable and can easily cover rent payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even then, it offers an 8.3% dividend yield, which is fully covered by FFO with a 73% payout ratio.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720991447310858_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1251\" data-height=\"608\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720991447310858_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chiron Real Estate property\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"311\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720991447310858_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720991447310858_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720991447310858_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47644028-17720991447310858_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Chiron Real Estate</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The REIT also already reduced its dividend once in 2025, and this appears to be reassuring many investors, who then conclude that they already cut the dividend and are therefore unlikely to cut it again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, that's exactly what I expect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I actually predicted the divided cut of 2025 in a separate article that you can read by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4773460-3-reits-to-sell-before-they-cut-their-dividend\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4773460-3-reits-to-sell-before-they-cut-their-dividend\" target=\"_blank\">clicking here. </a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Most of it remains relevant today. They gained some time by reducing the dividend, but I think that they didn't cut it enough.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problem is that the REIT has a lot of leverage. Its debt-to-EBITDA is 6.2x, and they still have some preferred equity on top of that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, their average debt term is only about four years, on average, so they will face major near-term refinancing needs, and given that their current interest rate is only about 3.7%, they will face much higher interest expense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This will then pressure their cash flow and lead to a surge in their payout ratio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If everything goes perfectly to plan and interest rates decline from here, they may get lucky and still avoid a cut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But what investors need to remember here is that Chiron Real Estate focuses primarily on riskier, higher cap rate healthcare properties, often located in secondary or tertiary markets with non-credit tenants. It has historically gotten a near 8% cap rate on average on its acquisitions, and you just don't get such high cap rates without taking risks. The REIT has suffered some tenant bankruptcies and likely will again in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And given the state of its balance sheet, I think that it would take only a small setback for it to be forced to cut its dividend once again. There's little room for error when you operate with so much leverage and short debt maturities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I would note that the REIT just recently completed a <span class=\"highlighted_text\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4546200-global-medical-reit-to-rebrand-to-chiron-real-estate\">rebranding</a></span>, changing its name from Global Medical REIT to Chiron Real Estate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This, on its own, of course, does not suggest a dividend cut, but companies will often push for major strategy and capital allocation changes before rebranding to mark a new, fresh start.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that a dividend cut is a high risk here, and for this reason, we prefer to invest in some of its peers, like Sila Realty Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SILA\" title=\"Sila Realty Trust, Inc.\">SILA</a>) at High-Yield Landlord.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global Net Lease: Poor Track Record and Heavy Exposure to Troubled Assets</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global Net Lease (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GNL\" title=\"Global Net Lease, Inc.\">GNL</a>) has surged a lot lately, and it has bulls celebrating.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/saupload_5cf9c14f0f9627e9a3f69f6ae121991c.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/saupload_5cf9c14f0f9627e9a3f69f6ae121991c.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/saupload_5cf9c14f0f9627e9a3f69f6ae121991c.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/saupload_5cf9c14f0f9627e9a3f69f6ae121991c.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

When you include its preferred equity, it rises closer to 8x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, its debt maturities are short at just about three years, with significant maturities coming its way in 2027 and 2028.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, the REIT still generates today about a quarter of its rental revenue from net lease office buildings, and those properties only have about 4.5 years left on their leases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have previously <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4477592-orion-office-reit-dont-get-caught-holding\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4477592-orion-office-reit-dont-get-caught-holding\" target=\"_blank\">explained</a> why I think that these properties are a disaster. They still generate a steady income while they have years left on the leases, but I think that they face significant maturities as leases expire, and it will be very costly and difficult, if even possible, to release some of these properties.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/47644028-17713187624835322_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1227\" data-height=\"691\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/47644028-17713187624835322_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Global Net Lease office\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/47644028-17713187624835322_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/47644028-17713187624835322_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/47644028-17713187624835322_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/47644028-17713187624835322_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Global Net Lease</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Office vacancy rates are at an all-time high of more than 20%, and these older single-tenant office buildings are the worst impacted by the shift to hybrid work settings. With AI now further reducing the need for white-collar labor, I expect things to only get worse in the near term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The balance of power is clearly on the side of the tenants, and this spells trouble for a REIT that still generates 26% of its rental income from such potentially unsustainable assets, even as its own balance sheet is heavily leveraged as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">GNL may manage to delay a dividend cut for a while, but I expect them to eventually be forced to cut it again. It would be prudent for them to do it as soon as possible to retain more cash flow for deleveraging and to accelerate their transformation away from these troubled assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I want to remind you that this is the track record of the REIT: It's one of the most challenged in the entire REIT sector, repeatedly diluting shareholders with ill-timed capital raises, which later led to many dividend cuts:</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/saupload_99d2386b8b5d5b1f24bf523af119ed08.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/saupload_99d2386b8b5d5b1f24bf523af119ed08.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/saupload_99d2386b8b5d5b1f24bf523af119ed08.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/saupload_99d2386b8b5d5b1f24bf523af119ed08.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

As such, when tech stocks (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLK\" title=\"State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF\">XLK</a>) are soaring, QQQ outperforms QQQI. However, in a market where they flounder, QQQI tends to outperform QQQ. Given that recently increasing caution has been put on mega-cap tech stocks due to their massive AI CapEx commitments this year with uncertain return profiles, and there are major concerns about valuations and AI disruption of the software industry, QQQ has been floundering, which means that the covered calls that QQQI employs are helping it to outperform by giving it additional cash flow without having to forfeit much, if anything, in the way of upside so far this year. This is exactly the type of environment where covered call strategies shine.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, what about moving forward? Should investors continue to play QQQI, or should they switch back to QQQ, or perhaps should they avoid mega-cap tech altogether? In this article, I will break down QQQI in more detail and share my take on the stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Structural Flaws That Could Undermine Long-Term Returns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I last wrote about QQQI back in December, when I highlighted how the yield looks great, and the performance looks great, yet there are some <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855991-qqqi-13-percent-yield-looks-perfect-until-you-dig-into-details\">structural flaws</a> that will lead to long-term total return underperformance. These include the relatively high expense ratio of 0.68%, the fact that its performance looks artificially good, given that, since its inception, its underlying index has performed very well, and it has only been in business a little over two years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, while its monthly distributions and its high annual yield of over 1% per month in payouts look extremely attractive, its SEC yield is microscopic, which means that it is generating virtually all of its yield from premiums that it earns from writing covered calls against its underlying holdings. This means that nearly all of its distributions amount to a return of capital. Additionally, even while much is made of the active management and its ability to dynamically manage the portfolio to preserve upside during bull markets to keep the ETF from falling too far behind, even year to date with a relatively sideways to even declining QQQ, QQQI has still seen its principal decline by more than QQQ has, showing that even in a relatively ideal scenario, it can still see its NAV erode more than its underlying index. This shows that its options-writing strategy does consistently eat into the NAV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_d8a636eb89095ed49ac399d2d39789f0.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_d8a636eb89095ed49ac399d2d39789f0.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_d8a636eb89095ed49ac399d2d39789f0.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_d8a636eb89095ed49ac399d2d39789f0.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, you will need a long-term bull market in QQQ and avoid too much sharp volatility for QQQI to preserve and grow NAV over time on top of its attractive distributions. This is especially true given that its top holdings and its general portfolio construction closely mirror QQQ’s, so that gives it an underlying equity risk and overweight tech exposure that is essentially the same.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/52820996-17722315454511085_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1150\" data-height=\"796\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/52820996-17722315454511085_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"QQQI Holdings\" width=\"640\" height=\"443\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"443\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/52820996-17722315454511085_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/52820996-17722315454511085_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/52820996-17722315454511085_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/52820996-17722315454511085_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">QQQI Holdings <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI CapEx, Valuations, And The Shifting Macro Backdrop</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The macro factors that have driven QQQI’s strong total return performance over time are bullish for tech, which has also led to it underperforming QQQ. However, recently, it has outperformed QQQ because some of these factors have shifted, namely that AI enthusiasm is tempered somewhat, investors are now looking more closely at valuations as well as returns on massive AI CapEx investments, and software is increasingly being viewed through a critical lens as a likely candidate for disruption from AI innovations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This means that QQQ has seen its performance weakened considerably relative to dividend stocks, as evidenced by the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHD\" title=\"Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF\">SCHD</a>)’s significant outperformance of QQQ over the past three months, while QQQI has only moderately tempered that weakness through its options-writing strategy and has still trailed SCHD by a huge margin over that time period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bf1aead3ed1fc3c876785779d1da7671.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bf1aead3ed1fc3c876785779d1da7671.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bf1aead3ed1fc3c876785779d1da7671.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bf1aead3ed1fc3c876785779d1da7671.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that tech valuations remain far from what I would consider bargain territory and we are still early on in the AI CapEx cycle, as well as the potential for software disruption, I do not think that QQQ is at all appealing relative to QQQI right now. And so, therefore, if presented with the two and trying to gain things over a relatively short- to medium-term horizon, I would continue to favor QQQI and other NASDAQ-focused covered call ETFs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, there are important trade-offs that need to be kept in mind. First of all, if we were to see a material pullback of QQQ into correction territory, I would probably switch from QQQI to QQQ to avoid missing out on a strong bounce back, since covered calls would temper that and potentially lock in long-term losses.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Better Income Alternatives With Stronger Risk-Reward Profiles</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, it is worth questioning whether you should have much exposure to any tech fund at all right now, given the valuations and macro factors already mentioned, especially since you can also buy dividend-paying stocks on a value basis that are enjoying macro tailwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, you can buy <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4876562-the-ultimate-8-percent-yielding-sleep-well-at-night-retirement-income-machine\">several high-quality, investment-grade midstreams</a> that are benefiting from AI CapEx and do not suffer from uncertain AI return risks as the mega-cap techs do, while generating, in some cases, up to a 9% yield and enjoying inflation-beating growth, while also trading at single-digit valuation multiples. Even in ETF format, you can buy the Alerian MLP ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMLP\" title=\"Alerian MLP ETF\">AMLP</a>) with a near 8% yield and a strong recent dividend growth history.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, you can buy <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4853261-7-8-percent-yielding-utf-one-of-best-infrastructure-income-opportunities-upgrade\">high-yield funds</a> like the Cohen &amp; Steers Infrastructure Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UTF\" title=\"Cohen &amp; Steers Infrastructure Fund Inc\">UTF</a>) that offer mid- to high-single-digit yields and even broader diversification across AI-related infrastructure. Moreover, you can buy high-quality, conservative, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4873260-saaspocalypse-created-one-of-best-11-percent-plus-yielding-opportunities\">senior secured software lenders</a> at deep discounts to NAV and dividend yields that compare very nicely with QQQI’s while enjoying a steep discount to NAV and a more conservative profile in terms of exposure to software given their senior secured lending stance at loan-to-values of between the mid-teens and the 30s rather than having straight-up equity exposure to richly valued software companies that occupy a substantial portion of QQQ and QQQI’s portfolios. Not only that, but you get these yields without the covered call caps on upside potential.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, while I think that QQQI is a better play than QQQ in the current environment, I am steering clear of both in favor of much more attractively valued and risk-positioned opportunities in the midstream and software lending space in my 7-8% yielding, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/52820996-high-yield-investor/6260770-our-portfolio-track-record-results-through-february-14-2026\">total return outperforming,</a> and below-market beta portfolios at <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1369-high-yield-investor\">High Yield Investor</a>.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ODD\" title=\"Oddity Tech Ltd.\">ODD</a></span>) is a personal care company with a digital-first direct-to-consumer (DTC) model. ODD’s portfolio includes its own brands, Il Makiage, SpoiledChild, and the newer telehealth concept MethodIQ. Recently, the company has faced challenges with an abnormal spike in user acquisition costs tied to changes<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> in Meta Platforms’ (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">META</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) ad delivery algorithms. Of course, this has cast doubts over ODD’s underlying business model and long-term prospects. However, the stock is now trading at such a deep discount that I feel it could be worthwhile speculating with a small bullish position. Hence, I rate ODD a viable contrarian </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content\">“buy”</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> at these levels.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Online Beauty And Wellness</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Oddity Tech Ltd. is a beauty and wellness company that sells online and direct-to-consumer. ODD was incorporated back in 2013 and is headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel. Interestingly, the stock has been on a sharp decline since its 2025 highs. It’s now down almost 85% since then, so I thought it was worthwhile taking a look at its investment appeal at these levels.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277894475367_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1497\" data-height=\"587\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277894475367_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Seeking Alpha Charts.\" width=\"640\" height=\"251\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277894475367_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277894475367_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277894475367_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277894475367_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Seeking Alpha Charts.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a quick overview, ODD’s business model relies on <a href=\"https://oddity.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://oddity.com/\" target=\"_blank\">e-commerce</a> using a direct-to-customer (DTC) approach. ODD sells beauty products through its digital platform, and most of its revenue is from online DTC sales. Other revenue streams represent a minor contribution, such as selling through a local Israeli channel and marketing affiliates. ODD’s platform operates the company’s own brands. And they’re also responsible for the development of these in-house brands for consumers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similarly, ODD’s physical products are manufactured for third parties under contract. In that sense, their <a href=\"https://investors.oddity.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oddity-launches-methodiq-telehealth-platform-reimagining-medical/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.oddity.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oddity-launches-methodiq-telehealth-platform-reimagining-medical/\" target=\"_blank\">brand portfolio</a> includes Il Makiage, SpoiledChild, and MethodIQ. Il Makiage is a beauty brand, best known for online shade-matching and complexion products. SpoiledChild is a brand focused on skin and hair, which is built around personalization. Lastly, MethodIQ is a newer brand concept described as a telehealth platform offering customized treatments in dermatology areas, such as acne, hyperpigmentation, and eczema.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277897212162_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"858\" data-height=\"477\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277897212162_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Earnings Presentation.

February 2026.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s also worth mentioning that ODD continues to focus on developing new brands. It has an internal brand incubator called <a href=\"https://www.oddity.com/about\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.oddity.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">New Ventures</a>, launched in 2019, created to develop and test new product categories using ODD’s technology, which includes data science for customer segmentation and product strategy. Likewise, this pipeline optimizes for responsive digital marketing for testing of ads and offers with creative iterations, as well as molecular discovery for screening potential ingredients. In fact, ODD’s incubator also predicts the product’s properties and uses hyperspectral vision for capturing images to make more precise skin analysis for improved diagnostics.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277894232457_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"861\" data-height=\"478\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277894232457_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Earnings Presentation.

February 2026.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of that, ODD’s user experience with Web UX is supposed to increase conversion using personalization. These tools improve product matching, marketing efficiency, and product development. Plus, they use a layer of <a href=\"https://investors.oddity.com/static-files/fb1c708c-a78b-49d7-87f5-9cc3629fc147\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.oddity.com/static-files/fb1c708c-a78b-49d7-87f5-9cc3629fc147\" target=\"_blank\">shared data</a> that feeds across their platforms. The company states that they’ve so far collected over 2 billion individual signals from 68 million users, like quiz answers, shade and skin inputs, browsing behavior, purchases, and others. And ODD flags this as a competitive advantage because, as more users generate data, this loops back into their machine learning models for better conversion, retention, and efficiency, which is at the core of their growth flywheel.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation And Risk Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, from a valuation perspective, ODD currently trades at a $790.7 million market cap. Its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/19181317\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/19181317\" target=\"_blank\">latest 6-K</a> shows they ended 2025 with $402.2 million in cash and $373.7 million in marketable securities (short and long term). That amounts to approximately $775.9 million in liquid resources against $584.4 million in financial debt (exchangeable note). Using those figures, I estimate ODD’s EV at roughly $599.2 million. And if we compare it to its Q4 revenues of $152.7 million (annualized $610.8 million), it implies a quite cheap EV/S of 1.0. For comparison, their sector’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ODD/valuation/metrics\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ODD/valuation/metrics\" target=\"_blank\">median EV/S</a> is much closer to 1.5, so it would appear that investors are likely pricing in a major contraction in their topline or margin deterioration.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277894641037_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1061\" data-height=\"572\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277894641037_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Earnings Presentation.

February 2026.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that in mind, that brings <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"us\" htloopnumber=\"853036071\">us</em> to ODD’s recently significant abnormal <a href=\"https://investors.oddity.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oddity-tech-reports-record-full-year-2025-results\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.oddity.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oddity-tech-reports-record-full-year-2025-results\" target=\"_blank\">increase</a> in user acquisition cost (UAC). For a digital-first DTC company, paid ads are a core growth lever. If UAC spikes unexpectedly, growth can slow, and margins can compress. ODD also stated that the dislocation was tied to META’s changes related to its ad delivery and targeting algorithm. And naturally, this now casts doubts about ODD’s <a href=\"https://dkeithwilson.com/research/zynga-case-study/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://dkeithwilson.com/research/zynga-case-study/\" target=\"_blank\">platform risk</a> and its dependence on META. After all, a good example of platform risk was Zynga, which was another rapidly growing company that relied heavily on META. Yet, after META implemented changes to its mobile gaming policies, Zynga’s business quickly dwindled.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So it’s unsurprising to see that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557790-oddity-tech-falls-again-after-bull-ratings-are-pulled-on-wall-street\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557790-oddity-tech-falls-again-after-bull-ratings-are-pulled-on-wall-street\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street downgraded</a> ODD, and Bank of America warned that the problem is widespread, affecting acquisitions broadly across brands. Beauty is competitive, and if online acquisition becomes less efficient, brands with a strong retail presence may gain the upper hand in acquiring customers physically relative to online discovery. For example, companies like Sephora and Ulta, among others, don't rely as heavily on online channels.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277895320947_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1278\" data-height=\"719\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277895320947_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Earnings Presentation.

February 2026.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, ODD could be at risk of losing considerable market share if it can’t adapt and acquire new customers. But, <a href=\"https://investors.oddity.com/static-files/fb1c708c-a78b-49d7-87f5-9cc3629fc147\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.oddity.com/static-files/fb1c708c-a78b-49d7-87f5-9cc3629fc147\" target=\"_blank\">historically</a>, ODD’s revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth have been consistent. And even if it were to level off at where it is today, it would suggest that ODD may be a viable contrarian “<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"853036071\">buy</em>” despite the prevailing pessimistic sentiment. However, if I instead add their <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/19181317\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/19181317\" target=\"_blank\">2025 cash flows</a> from operations and CAPEX (a cash burn proxy), it would appear ODD remains cash flow positive, but to a lesser extent. Using this approach, I estimate ODD generated approximately $83.6 million in 2025, which showcases they’re not in a death spiral stage just yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But it’s worth mentioning that, so far, Meta hasn’t published a note explaining what they have changed in detail, which could help explain ODD’s current conversion issues. ODD said that the <a href=\"https://investors.oddity.com/static-files/2f1638d6-7525-448b-aacf-da1fae2879b6\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.oddity.com/static-files/2f1638d6-7525-448b-aacf-da1fae2879b6\" target=\"_blank\">algorithm</a> diverted it to lower-quality auctions at abnormally high costs, meaning that ad placements convert less because they are directed to audiences that are less likely to <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"853036071\">buy</em>. Moreover, auctions are not only less productive but also more expensive compared to historical performance.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772227791258213_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1316\" data-height=\"747\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772227791258213_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Earnings Presentation.

February 2026.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, ODD may need to diversify across channels with ads through Google, TikTok, affiliates, influencers, and partnerships to reduce its dependence on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874828-oddity-tech-ltd-odd-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874828-oddity-tech-ltd-odd-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">Meta</a>. However, as you might imagine, these types of changes are structural and will likely require a longer repair cycle. ODD may even need to rethink its whole marketing strategy, as ads on Google work differently from ads on <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"facebook\" htloopnumber=\"853036071\">Facebook</em> or Instagram. Also, according to Bank of America, a more concrete solution for ODD’s marketing issues may take at least until 2027 to show results.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Cautious Contrarian “<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"853036071\">Buy</em>”</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I feel ODD’s business is now definitely challenged. The reality is that we don’t know yet the true extent of their problems that may arise from Meta’s recent policy changes. If we later learn that ODD can make a few tweaks and continue operating as usual, then I think the stock would bounce very quickly. On the other hand, if Meta’s changes are structural and require a fundamental pivot in the way ODD conducts its marketing strategy, then this contrarian “<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"853036071\">Buy</em>” may take much longer to fully play out. However, at such a deep discount, I feel ODD is now worth speculating with a small bullish position at these levels. Just make sure you keep your position sizing under control.</p>",

After thinking over the issue for a few days, we felt that the analysis could use a follow-up. That analysis focused more on pointing out the flaws of common indicators such as high P/E without really offering alternative ideas to diagnose the market.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this background, our goal in this article is quite simple. I will explain why and how I use junk bond rates as a leading signal for the equity market. I’ve been experimenting with this idea for more than a decade by now, and my winning odds are good. The ideas apply to all major equity indices I’ve experimented with (such as the <span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI\" title=\"Dow Jones Industrial Average Index\">DJI</a></span>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\">SP500</a>, and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COMP:IND\">NASDAQ</a>, and also small cap (RTY)). But for the sake of brevity, this article will use the SP500 index as the primary example.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I assume most investors can agree on the close relationship between corporate bonds and stocks. There are simply the two sides of the same coin. As such, I will focus my attention on explaining why I particularly like to use junk bonds but no other bonds (say, investment-grade bonds). In a nutshell, I am more interested in junk bond rates because A) they change more sensitively to corporate fundamentals, and B) they serve as a more effective depth indicator than bonds with better investment grades. In our experience, many (probably most) investors hold sizable bond positions of treasury and investment grade bonds regardless of market conditions. But due to their weaker credit ratings, junk bond rates change sensitivity to investors’ risk appetite. When junk bond yields are unusually low, it indicates to me that investors’ risk appetite has expanded to include assets with questionable financial strength. I am not usually too worried about assets with high quality (like the Mag 7) trading at high multiples. But when assets of sub-par qualities are also trading with a premium, I begin to be concerned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the above understanding, let’s examine the current status of junk bond rates and analyze the implications for the SP500.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Historical perspective</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To provide the perspective needed in this article, I first need to find junk rates data for a sufficiently long period of time. For the purpose, the chart below displays the dividend yield from the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund Investor Shares (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VWEHX\" title=\"Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund Investor\">VWEHX</a>). The VWEHX mutual fund is the oldest junk bond fund I can find, with data dating back to 1978, as seen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087769289606_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1554\" data-height=\"509\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087769289606_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"210\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087769289606_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087769289606_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087769289606_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087769289606_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Per the fund's latest discourse as of Dec 31, 2025 (see the next chart below), VWEHX’s exposure is heavily concentrated in below-investment-grade corporate bonds. Its largest exposure is corporate bonds with BB credit ratings, which account for more than half of its total assets (51.5%). The second largest exposure is toward bonds with a B- credit rating, representing about 1/3 of its total assets (31.5%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the long term, the historical average of the fund’s yield is around 7.76%, as shown. The yield has dipped to as low as about 4.1% amid the epic easing during the COVID pandemic. The yield has climbed up substantially since then and is currently hovering around 6.18%. It is thus lower than the historical average, but not to an alarming degree. And we will further explore the implications next.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-1772208776999011_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1645\" data-height=\"826\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-1772208776999011_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"321\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-1772208776999011_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-1772208776999011_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-1772208776999011_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-1772208776999011_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Vanguard</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Junk bond yield as a leading signal</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To explore the long-term effectiveness of junk bond yields as a leading signal for the equity market, I will need the long-term performance of an equity index fund. On this front, the oldest fund I can find is the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VFIAX\" title=\"Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral\">VFIAX</a>). As a fun fact, when John Bogle first launched the fund in 1976, the fund was mocked as \"Bogle's Folly\" because critics couldn't believe investors would settle for a fund that \"only\" provides average market returns by design.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, the top panel of the next chart shows the price movement of VFIAX in terms of price corrections off high. The bottom panel shows the yield spread of VWEHX relative to fed fund rates approximated by 3-month treasury rates. A quite clear correlation (that is, an inverse correlation) can be seen even from a visual examination between these two panels. The green and red arrows highlighted a few key market events that played a definitive role in the SP500’s returns in the past 50 years or so. These key events included the formation and burst of the dot-com bubble, the 2008 financial crisis, the 2010 European bank crisis, the monetary easing following the COVID-19 breakout, and the subsequent tightening. As seen, amid all key junctures, when the junk bond rates are unusually low relative to risk-free rates, as indicated by the green arrows, the SP500 index suffered a sharp correction shortly afterward due to the fundamental dynamics mentioned in the first section. Such unusually low junk bond rates suggest that the market’s risk appetite has swung too far to the greedy extreme. And the opposite is also true, as highlighted by the red arrows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087772304945_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2419\" data-height=\"1579\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087772304945_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"418\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087772304945_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087772304945_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087772304945_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087772304945_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other risks and final thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If history does rhyme, you can see why I am not too alarmed by the current market conditions. As mentioned earlier, junk bond rates are currently below average but not alarmingly so. The current spread between VWEHX and 3-month treasury rates gave me a very similar assessment. As seen, the current yield spread sits at 2.492%. The bad news for equity investors is that it is below the historical average of 4.83%. The good news is that the spread has thickened considerably from its recent trough and is no longer alarmingly thin. Furthermore, the latest dot plot, announced by the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/money/federal-open-market-committee\" rel=\"nofollow\">Federal Open Market Committee</a> in Dec 2025, shows a path of continued cuts to the fed fund rates in the near future. As you can see from the following screenshot, the dot plot suggests the median expectation of the fed funds rate to decrease from the current level of around 3.6% to around 3.0% in 2027. With everything else being equal, such a decrease could further thicken the yield spread between VWEHX and 3-month treasury rates to about 3.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To close, the goal of this article is mainly twofold. First, I want to offer an alternative idea, the use of junk bond rates, for investors to diagnose the equity (beyond P/E ratios and rolling-returns in past years). Second, I want to apply this idea to the current market conditions. My diagnosis is that current junk bond rates certainly are on the lower end and worth closely monitoring. But I do not believe it is to an alarming degree to trigger a dramatic departure from the SP500 or other equity index.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087770125518_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087770125518_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087770125518_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087770125518_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087770125518_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087770125518_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FOMC</span></p></figcaption></figure></p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IQV\" title=\"IQVIA Holdings Inc.\">IQV</a></span>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4803215-iqvia-q2-earnings-exceeded-my-expectations\">article</a>, where I covered the company’s Q2 earnings beat thanks to $4.017B in revenue, driven by growth in the Technology &amp; Analytics Solutions (TAS) segment. I<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> pointed out that despite the market’s pessimism, the company’s profitability continues to be their leading highlight, as high cash flow conversions boosted their adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Accordingly, the company reaffirmed their full-year outlook despite the volatility and uncertainties of the biotech sector’s R&amp;D environment. So, I was bullish on IQVIA heading into the back half of 2025 and expected the company to keep feasting on their current bookings and backlog to fuel their growth.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, <a href=\"https://ir.iqvia.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2026/IQVIA-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results-Issues-Full-Year-2026-Guidance/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">IQVIA's Q4 earnings</a> confirmed that thesis with a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4547802-iqvia-non-gaap-eps-of-3_42-beats-by-0_02-revenue-of-4_36b-beats-by-120m\">beat</a> on EPS and revenue. Plus, the company finished the year with an acceleration in R&amp;DS bookings and an expansion of their backlog. However, management posted what I would say was typical guidance for 2026 with routine increases in revenue and EPS. The company’s EPS guidance was below the Street’s consensus, which led to analysts revising their target downward and the market <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4547971-iqvia-stock-slides-after-q4-results-outlook\">responding</a> accordingly. As a result, IQV is trading in the $160-$170 per share range after trading above $240 per share about a month ago. I’m looking to take advantage of the recent discount on IQV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I intend to review what we saw earlier in 2025, review what the Street was expecting heading into Q4, and then compare that to what IQVIA’s results were. In addition, I will highlight a few risks that investors should consider when managing their position. Finally, I will take a look at the charts to see how I can manage my position post-earnings.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Q1–Q3 Recap</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking back at IQVIA’s Q1-Q3 performance, the company logged steady growth thanks to a combination of the durable TAS segment and sustained efforts in the R&amp;DS. The company did stress that macroeconomic conditions continue to impact the CRO arena; however, they were still seeing deferred demand for their services rather than outright cancellations. That was evident in their Q4 earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Throughout 2025, the TAS segment’s growth was fueled by customers still turning to IQVIA for data and support. Despite the macro headwinds, it is clear that IQVIA remains an industry leader for these services and is embedded in customer workflows. Meanwhile, R&amp;DS was able to make the best of delayed trial starts and cautious spending. Moreover, the company’s backlog composition improved with the skew moving toward late-phase trials, which have higher lifetime values.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I mentioned in the introduction, the company’s profitability metrics remain the primary highlight. Not only did their margins hold up, but IQVIA is still elite at converting their earnings into cash. The company's cash conversion rate has generated enough capital flexibility to repurchase shares while still servicing their debt, and investing in innovation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Essentially, the Q1-Q3 results earlier in the year supported my bull thesis that IQVIA had already evolved beyond a traditional CRO, and is now becoming a hybrid as they continue to expand on their data, analytics, and clinical execution platform. What is more, that development set Q4 up to be the biggest quarter since the COVID era.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Q4 and Full-Year 2025 Review</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IQVIA’s Q4 numbers verified some reassuring narratives and trends. The company’s revenue acceleration in Q4 was powered by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4866507-iqvia-holdings-inc-iqv-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">increases</a> in R&amp;DS booking activity and TAS deal flow. Similar to Q1-Q3, the growth came across segments, rather than a single business segment benefiting from a one-off deal or a dramatic change in the healthcare industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072293787_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1002\" data-height=\"417\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072293787_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IQVIA Q4 Earnings Summary\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"266\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072293787_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072293787_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072293787_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072293787_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IQVIA Q4 Earnings Summary <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Diving into the TAS segment, IQVIA customers are continuing to employ AI-enabled analytics, solutions, and tools. It looks as if the company has developed some valuable services in the TAS portfolio that are becoming vital for their customers to navigate product launches and manage pricing dynamics. As for the R&amp;DS segment, the company reported the strongest bookings quarter of the year, which suggests that sector’s pipeline activity is beginning to percolate back to normal levels as sponsors regain confidence in funding and a clearer horizon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Once again, the company’s book-to-bill and backlog growth remain a highlight aspect. IQVIA has an immense backlog of $32.7B, which they expect to convert to about $8.3B over the next twelve months, which gives IQVIA and investors assured revenue visibility going into 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last but not least, IQVIA’s profitability grades remain stellar, with Q4 adjusted EBITDA rising above $1B, and their full-year EBITDA right near the top end of expectations. I will also circle that their adjusted EPS growth continued despite higher interest expense. The company’s cash flow performance is still in championship form, with near-100% conversion of adjusted net income into free cash flow, which is not only jaw-dropping on its own but will allow the company to be aggressive with their bankroll in terms of growth initiatives, keep paying down debt, and still commit to share repurchases.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>My Take </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, I would say IQVIA’s Q4/2025 earnings reinforced my expectations for 2025 and my bullish outlook for the long-term. I will concede that projecting IQVIA’s performance over 2025 did not take financial genius because the company has a strong track record of outperforming expectations, as well as impressive profitability metrics, and billions in backlog to be worked through.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-1772221907293571_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1052\" data-height=\"487\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-1772221907293571_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IQVIA Earnings History\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"296\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-1772221907293571_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-1772221907293571_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-1772221907293571_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-1772221907293571_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IQVIA Earnings History <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>So what is my point?</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, IQVIA is an industry leader that provides vital services that make the healthcare sector turn. The company has expanded their offering to be involved from the inception through commercialization. So not only can the company benefit from being the customer’s trusted ally for every phase of a project’s lifespan, but IQVIA now has a rough forecast for years, or possibly decades. So, no one should be surprised by the company showing a reacceleration in growth, and it has yet to hit their ceiling. The Street is expecting the company to report single-digit EPS growth for 2026, but will return to double-digit EPS growth going into the next decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071734617_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1051\" data-height=\"297\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071734617_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IQVIA Annual EPS Estimates\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"181\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071734617_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071734617_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071734617_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071734617_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IQVIA Annual EPS Estimates <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for revenue, analysts are projecting IQVIA to report mid-single-digit to low-double-digit growth going into the middle of the 2030s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219073354301_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1051\" data-height=\"393\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219073354301_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IQVIA Annual Revenue Estimates\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"239\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219073354301_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219073354301_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219073354301_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219073354301_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IQVIA Annual Revenue Estimates <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, it would seem as if the Street is confident that IQVIA will not only survive the current macro uncertainties but also has the potential to possibly double their earnings over the next ten years. Certainly, these numbers are not breakneck hypergrowth, but I would like to remind you that IQVIA has impressive profitability metrics that allow them to maximize every tenth of a percentage point of growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071903234_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"720\" data-height=\"394\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071903234_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IQVIA Profitability Metrics\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071903234_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071903234_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071903234_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071903234_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IQVIA Profitability Metrics <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I understand that healthcare investors are not looking for single-digit top-line growth from a healthcare company, but the high profitability and strong free cash generation make IQVIA act like a stealth compounder. This combination of efficiency and financial leverage can allow IQVIA to outstrip some of the higher-growth peers who are closer to a “hand-to-mouth” and who use a higher portion of their revenue just to fund operations or growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yes, the share buybacks might be seen as a form of financial engineering that equates to EPS growth, but I don’t think this is a superficial action by management. We cannot overlook that IQVIA has high-profitability metrics and a hefty bank account that can be used to maximize shareholder value without sabotaging their financials or long-term outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, this is something that has been evident throughout 2025 and is clearly mapped out for the foreseeable future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks to Consider</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although I’m bullish on IQVIA’s long-term outlook thanks to bookings and backlog, I must admit that the company is still going to have to deal with current healthcare headwinds that have delayed clinical trials, constricted biotech funding, as well as general regulatory or political risks. These headwinds could weigh on near-term R&amp;D execution for a prolonged period of time. It is possible these headwinds become the new norm, IQVIA’s growth prospects are blunted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will note that leverage remains a risk to consider, with their total debt at around $16.31B. However, their consistent cash flow generation and disciplined use of their capital diminish the likelihood that debt becomes a big constraint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps the biggest risk to investors is really the recent damage to the growth narrative. As I have mentioned in my previous IQV articles, the company experienced absurd growth during COVID, which set a high watermark for a few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072035432_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"710\" data-height=\"408\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072035432_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IQVIA Growth Grade\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"368\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072035432_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072035432_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072035432_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072035432_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IQVIA Growth Grade <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has started to show resurgence in 2025, but the growth metrics are going to be living in the shadow of the COVID era.

On the safer side, I could wait for the ticker to turn bullish on the Go-No-Go indicator and for the share price to breach the January 2026 anchored VWAP before adding to the position.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Once I have my fill, I will look to book profits around my Sell Target 1 of $297 per share in order to move my position closer to a \"house money\" status and hold for a long-term investment.</p>",

As the largest company in the world reports its earnings, it gives us a<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> direct view into the definitive data set for evaluating the health of the AI infrastructure build-out. With that in mind, I’ll review my current rating of the company to assess if it is still one of the great opportunities on the market despite its vast size.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Dynamics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557159-nvidia-non-gaap-eps-of-1_62-beats-by-0_08-revenue-of-68_13b-beats-by-1_9b\">announced yet another double beat</a>, with Non-GAAP EPS of $1.62, a slight beat of 8 cents by NVIDIA’s standards. Revenue came in at $68.13B for the quarter, also a beat of $1.9B and an eye-watering 73% Y/Y increase and a Q/Q improvement of 20%, which is simply crazy considering the size of the company. This suggests that the virtuous cycle of AI adoption remains in its early-to-middle stages, even as the market is currently grappling with concerns about the sustained CapEX. In total, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/171344939\">FY revenue came out at $215.9B</a>, up 65% from fiscal 2025. Gross margin stood at 75%, reflecting exceptional pricing power despite the massive R&amp;D and manufacturing costs associated with leading-edge 3nm and 4nm process nodes. On a FY basis, the small compression in gross margins is linked to a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/399456576_The_Global_Computing_Power_Game_NVIDIA's_Profit_Structure_and_China's_Domestic_Substitution_Under_the_'Chip_Tax'\" rel=\"nofollow\">$4.5B inventory charge recognized in Q1</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can clearly see that NVIDIA is becoming more and more concentrated as the data center segment now accounts for approximately 91.5% of the total top-line, underscoring the industry’s shift from classical machine learning to gen AI. The segment alone generated $62.3B in quarterly revenue, thanks to the sustained strength of the Blackwell architecture ramp and the Blackwell Ultra platform. Overall, the company generated $97B in free cash flow, which is simply staggering, considering where the figure was only a couple of years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Diving deeper segment-wise, the current dominance in the DC segment is not a result of chip sales but a consequence of NVIDIA’s evolution into a full-stack provider of entire data-center -scale computing platforms. This has been highlighted by the surge in networking revenue, which has totaled $11B in Q4, a 263% increase compared to the prior year. This growth reflects the transition from isolated GPU deployments to gigascale AI factories where inter-chip communication is as critical as the compute itself. The networking business has scaled more than tenfold since fiscal 2021, <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-mellanox-for-6-9-billion\" rel=\"nofollow\">after NVIDIA acquired Mellanox</a>. And though you could see a risk in NVIDIA being so reliant on Data center revenue, it is actually increasingly diversifying its customer base away from traditional hyperscalers such as Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) and Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>). That would be related to demand from AI model makers, enterprises and sovereign nations that is accelerating, suggesting that the AI build-out is broadening beyond a handful of tech giants. And this simple dynamic is critical in mitigating the potential risk of an incoming spending digesting period among the top hyperscalers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I also want to touch on sovereign AI, which has been deemed the new geopolitical asset class and is one of the most striking trends in fiscal 2026. The segment involves individual nations in building domestic GPU clusters to ensure that they are not digitally colonized by offshore providers. This has become critical as it tripled in revenue during the year, surpassing $30B. For example, in Japan, <a href=\"https://www.softbank.jp/en/corp/news/press/sbkk/2025/20250723_01/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Softbank is deploying over 10,000 Blackwell GPUs</a> in a revolutionary AI Grid that integrates processing directly into the 5G cellular network. This will allow for low-latency processing for robotics and autonomous vehicles without data ever leaving domestic soil.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I want to say that the quarter has been strong for NVIDIA, yet the market has punished it rather severly considering its beat all around, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557606-nvidia-stands-alone-upbeat-outlook-sends-stock-higher-leaving-mag-7-in-the-red\">by shedding nearly 5.5%</a>. The guidance was also great for Q1 of the company’s fiscal 2027, as it guided for revenue to $78B + or – 2%, which would imply a Y/Y growth rate of 77%. Mainly, I believe that the stock dropped as investors were looking at more than what was characterized as an uneventful report. This is inherently linked to the perceived risks of massive spending in the industry, as some hyperscaler capex is approaching nearly 100% of operating cash flow in some cases. In a way, investors are expecting more than perfection, which is already what NVIDIA is delivering.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the stock dropping while revenue keeps growing at a relentless pace, it means that NVDA is actually becoming cheaper; even at a P/E Non-GAAP of 40.91, it is actually trending at the middle of its peers' range and historically speaking, one of the lowest levels seen since 2019. The company is also seeing its FCF yield tick up as it now reaches 2.1%, as the company continues to be an incredible free cash flow generator. On a forward basis, I believe that it is crazy that NVIDIA is priced at a forward P/E of 23.05, considering its growth and its guidance that will certainly be exceeded in the coming quarter. That would be lower than companies like Oracle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>) at 26.95, and far lower than its closest competitor, AMD, at 48.84. Taking into account a fair ratio that will account for margin strength and market cap, the company's fair P/E would be at around 57x, suggesting that the current levels are pricing in far less optimism than the fundamentals support.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside of its clear moat in hardware, I believe that one of the key advantages of NVIDIA has been its actual software moat, as the firm remains deep in the realm of deployment and inference. This will help in defending CUDA against AMD’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/rocm.html\" rel=\"noopener\">ROCm software stack</a>, which has significantly closed the gap. As the market shifts toward Agentic AI, that requires complex reasoning and low-latency response, the full-stack optimization that the company has been undergoing now provides a productivity advantage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61549894-17721907179161835.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Graph valuation NVIDIA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"476\" height=\"253\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61549894-17721907179161835.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61549894-17721907179161835.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Valuation Metrics <span>(Data from Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Though the company has a large base of potential great growth opportunities, I believe that one that will be key will be the Rubin Architecture and the subsequent inference revolution. The <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/vera-rubin-nvl72/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vera Rubin platform</a> is set to enter mass production in early 2026, ahead of schedule. Rubin is engineered to reduce AI inference token costs by 10x compared to the Blackwell architecture, which will be critical as the industry shifts from training large models to running autonomous agentic AI systems 24/7. Rubin will also integrate HBM4 memory, providing 22 TB/s of bandwidth per GPU, a 2.75x to 2.8x increase over the Blackwell architecture. Internal benchmarks have been suggesting that while a 5MM investment in current infrastructure might generate a certain level of token revenue, a Rubin-based AI factory can produce the same <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/rubin-platform-ai-supercomputer\" rel=\"nofollow\">output for one-tenth the cost</a>. This drop in costs is to make high-level reasoning economically viable for enterprises.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61549894-17721907674761102.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Graph Growth NVIDIA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"477\" height=\"287\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61549894-17721907674761102.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61549894-17721907674761102.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Growth Metrics <span>(Data from SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest risk to NVIDIA’s growth narrative would be the sustainability of the massive spending currently underway by its largest customers. Those giants are projected to spend up to $690B on AI infrastructure in 2026, there is a growing concern that this hasn’t translated into broad-based corporate profits. Plus, CapEX is approaching nearly all of their operating cash flows. If the companies do not see a clear path to monetization, they may enter a digestion period, leading to a sudden revenue plateau.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVIDIA’s market share in AI accelerators is also facing a double assault from both the ASIC revolution and AMD. On the ASIC side, it comes from customers designing their own vertically integrated silicon, such as the AWS Trainium3. AMD’s MI400 series is also designed to challenge the Rubin architecture, particularly in memory-intensive tasks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that the recent earnings have cemented why NVIDIA is the most valuable company on earth, considering that it is the indispensable gatekeeper of the AI revolution. It is now building the technical blueprint of intelligence, and with its annual cadence, the Vera Rubin platform is set to heavily capitalize on the shift from training to inference, which is where the real economic value of AI will be captured. I keep my Strong Buy rating on NVIDIA.</p>",

September 2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a quick overview, VTVT’s pipeline includes the candidate <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06334133\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cadisegliatin</a> (TTP399), which is a GK activator. This candidate is being studied in Phase 3 for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), adjunctive to insulin. Cadisegliatin has a Breakthrough Therapy designation in T1D, yet despite this, VTVT as a whole seems relatively undercovered, so I thought it was worthwhile taking a look at it. After all, VTVT wholly owns Cadisegliatin for this particular indication, which targets a sizable <a href=\"https://www.globalgrowthinsights.com/market-reports/type-1-diabetes-t1d-market-104075\" rel=\"nofollow\">$4.4 billion</a> TAM (by 2035) in type 1 diabetes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, Cadisegliatin also presented positive results from the <a href=\"https://ir.vtvtherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vtv-therapeutics-announces-positive-topline-results-part-1-phase/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Simplici-T1</a> Phase 2 study, with statistically significant HbA1c improvement and a reduction in severe hypoglycemia events. Additionally, the candidate presented a favorable safety profile. The FDA draft guidance in 2023 recognized hypoglycemia endpoints as a clinically relevant efficacy outcome in diabetes trials, an outcome that was already reported in the Phase 2 trial. Before this, diabetes drug development was centered on the benefits through the improvement of hemoglobin A1C.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130169024_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1437\" data-height=\"540\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130169024_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Global Growth Insights.\" width=\"640\" height=\"241\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130169024_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130169024_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130169024_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130169024_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Global Growth Insights.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cadisegliatin is also being studied for Type 2 Diabetes (<a href=\"https://ir.vtvtherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vtv-therapeutics-and-m42s-iros-announce-submission-phase-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">T2D</a>) in Phase 2. This drug is researched for T2D in collaboration with G42 Healthcare, with a Phase 2 trial in insulin-using T2D patients in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. The protocol submission for this trial was made in December 2025, planning that the first patient's first visit would be expected in Q1 2026.

This is a RAGE antagonist, which is studied in Phase 2 for the treatment of glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer. Another indication is pneumonia, studied in Phase 2/3. Azeliragon is developed globally in partnership with Cantex.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, as I previously noted, I think Cadisegliatin is probably VTVT’s main value driver in the long run. In that sense, it’s worth mentioning that VTVT previously had issues with an unresolved finding in Cadisegliatin’s Phase 2 data. In fact, this setback prompted the FDA to place a hold on VTVT’s Cadisegliatin program. Fortunately, this incident was <a href=\"https://ir.vtvtherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vtv-therapeutics-announces-fda-has-lifted-clinical-hold/\" rel=\"nofollow\">resolved</a> when VTVT demonstrated that the finding was a misleading result produced by the testing method and not by the drug itself.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130210896_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"948\" data-height=\"535\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130210896_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Corporate Presentation.

September 2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe this basically removed a major R&amp;D roadblock for VTVT because the FDA’s reason to place the hold was resolved. Since then, Cadisegliatin’s development of the candidate has returned to being VTVT’s top R&amp;D priority. The company also noted a protocol amendment shortening CATT1 from 12 months to 6 months, with no change to primary endpoints.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, we should get Cadisegliatin’s topline results by 2H2026. Additionally, there is a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/31603272#VTVT-20250930_HTM_ic60bf641e18d443d8fee2fea1792d052_88\">food-effect study</a>. VTVT wants to gather data to see how the drug's effectiveness is affected by food changes. For this, they’ll use healthy volunteers who have taken the drug under the following study conditions: fasting versus fed, low-fat versus high-fat meal. And hopefully, this will be another positive data point that corroborates Cadisegliatin’s safety profile for a potential FDA submission down the road.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation And Risk Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, from a valuation perspective, VTVT currently trades at a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTVT\">$487.9 million</a> market cap. This makes it a microcap with a relatively low trading volume of only 24.1 thousand shares, which, at the current $39.00 PPS, implies a shallow trading liquidity of $0.9 million. Meaning even tiny buy/sell orders can push the stock price significantly, which is why you should anticipate VTVT will remain volatile in the near term. Still, their latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/18900576\">Q3 2025</a> 10-Q report shows their balance sheet holds $98.5 million in cash and equivalents against $0.3 million in notes payable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772223913026539_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1495\" data-height=\"584\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772223913026539_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Seeking Alpha Charts.\" width=\"640\" height=\"250\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772223913026539_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772223913026539_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772223913026539_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772223913026539_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Seeking Alpha Charts.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, it’s a relatively liquid balance sheet, and its book value reached $70.5 million at the end of Q3. However, by February 2026, VTVT also received <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/02/02/3230224/0/en/vTv-Therapeutics-Amends-License-Agreement-with-Newsoara-Biopharma-Co-Ltd-for-PDE4-inhibitor-HPP737.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">$20.0 million</a> related to their license agreement with Newsoara for a worldwide license on a novel PDE4 inhibitor. Therefore, VTVT’s “updated” cash balances are likely closer to $118.8 million if we include the recent licensing deal. That would also increase its book value proportionally by the same amount, to around $90.5 million, indicating a P/B of 5.4. For comparison, their <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTVT/valuation/metrics\">sector’s median</a> P/B is slightly cheaper at just 2.9, suggesting there’s likely some premium embedded in VTVT’s shares at these levels already.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, I also calculate VTVT burned through $5.2 million during Q3 2025. Note that I got this figure by simply adding its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTVT/cash-flow-statement\">quarterly cash flows</a> from operations and CAPEX. And this figure would suggest a cash runway of roughly 22.8 quarters, which is extremely healthy for a clinical biotech like VTVT. However, it’s worth mentioning that VTVT’s cash burn will likely ramp up in the coming quarters. After all, Cadisegliatin’s R&amp;D was halted, as I previously mentioned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239129803114_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1215\" data-height=\"620\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239129803114_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Corporate Presentation.

It’s challenging to anticipate how badly this will hit their cash reserves, but management’s investor presentation explicitly says that their runway will last “<a href=\"https://ir.vtvtherapeutics.com/static-files/a7d5327e-a471-475b-b279-0b07d3c08bee\" rel=\"nofollow\">well past</a>” the CATT1 topline readout.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since we should get this Cadisegliatin data point by 2H2026, I believe it substantially derisks VTVT at these levels. Naturally, if VTVT’s trials produce disappointing clinical data, then the stock will likely tumble after announcing those results. This is relatively normal among biotechs, and VTVT should behave similarly. However, on the other hand, if VTVT’s CATT1 data shows the candidate is suitable for a potential FDA submission, then it could be a major catalyst for the stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Worth Speculating</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, VTVT’s investment thesis at this point is pretty simple. If the upcoming CATT1 topline data is positive, then the stock could very well go much higher. T1D is a huge TAM, and given VTVT’s relatively small market cap, I feel a successful drug in this indication could generate substantial revenues over time. Still, as with other biotech stocks, clinical trials aren’t guaranteed to succeed. And in the meantime, VTVT’s cash burn could rise to unsustainable levels in their search for evidence that could warrant an FDA approval. So, until VTVT can actually commercialize Cadisegliatin, it will remain inherently speculative, which is why you should keep your position sizing manageable for now.</p>",

The fund changed its name, ticker, underlying index, and strategy on 8/1/2022. In particular, the fund used to be currency-hedged, and it is not anymore. Therefore, data prior to August 2022 are irrelevant to assess the current strategy, and should not be used in backtests.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DIVI has a portfolio of 413 stocks, a 30-day SEC yield of 3.19%, and an expense ratio of 0.09%. Distributions are paid quarterly. It is quite a large ETF, with $2.4 billion in assets and an average daily volume of $9.5 million. As described in the prospectus by <a href=\"#overview\">Franklin Templeton</a>, the underlying index “<em>includes a security selection and weighting process that aims to deliver a higher dividend yield than the Parent Index</em>.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The methodology uses an optimizer, taking into account some constraints, in particular weight limits for countries, sectors, constituents, and turnover. Despite targeting an enhanced aggregate dividend yield, the optimization under constraints may include stocks that don’t pay a dividend. The index is reconstituted quarterly, and the portfolio’s turnover rate was 26% in the most recent fiscal year. I will use as a benchmark the MSCI EAFE Index, represented by iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EFA\" title=\"iShares MSCI EAFE ETF\">EFA</a>), which has a similar geographical and size universe.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Portfolio</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund is mostly invested in large- and mega-cap companies (91% of asset value). The geographical allocation is close to the benchmark’s, as plotted on the next chart, which includes countries weighting more than 2%. Although the heaviest region is Europe (60% of assets), Japan comes in first position (22.7%), followed by the U.K. (13.8%). Other countries are below 10%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/2496631-1772232232581536.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Country allocation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"605\" height=\"282\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/2496631-1772232232581536.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/2496631-1772232232581536.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/2496631-1772232232581536.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Country allocation <span>(chart: author: data: Franklin Templeton, iShares.)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The portfolio has a focus on financials (28.9%) and significant exposure in industrials (15.6%).

DIVI was reshuffled in August 2022, so older data must be ignored in analysis and backtests. The track record of the new underlying index is still unconvincing after 3.5 years. Despite its low expense ratio, DIVI has underperformed several “Foreign Large Value” ETFs with similar or higher yields. In particular, PXF, EFV and FNDF boast higher returns and lower risk metrics, making them compelling alternatives to DIVI.</p>",
