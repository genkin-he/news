(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASH\" title=\"Ashland Inc.\">ASH</a></span>) is a specialty chemicals company that over time has realigned its business away from commodity chemicals in order to focus more on specialised products to serve a wide range<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> of pharmaceutical, personal care, and additives markets. These tend to be higher-value products, often with patent protection, where performance is more important to customers than price alone and any cyclicality is much less pronounced. While Ashland still retains some exposure to such end markets, following the spin-off of Valvoline in 2017, company-level EBIT margins have improved from under 7% in FY17 (the year to September 2017) to over 9% in FY25.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that despite a recent jump in the shares following the news that an activist investor has taken a stake, the shares still present an investment opportunity given an apparent discount valuation, despite the undoubted remaining volatility in certain markets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where the company is now</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a significant amount of portfolio right-sizing and reconfiguration, Ashland has changed significantly even within the last five years, although the most recent major disposal was nearly a year ago, with the March 2025 sale of underperforming Avoca (fragrance fixatives and botanical extracts). The company currently reports results under the following four divisions:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Life sciences (around 36% of sales at 1Q26 and 42% of pre-corporate cost EBITDA). This supplies excipients and tablet coating systems to the pharmaceutical and nutrition industries, as well as a variety of crop care and agricultural products. The following slide from the May 2025 Innovation Day gives a snapshot:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772120249710456_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1165\" data-height=\"605\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772120249710456_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Ashland Life Sciences profile\" width=\"640\" height=\"332\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"332\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772120249710456_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772120249710456_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772120249710456_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772120249710456_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ashland Innovation Day presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Personal Care (32% of sales at 1q26, 36% of EBITDA).

It sells to Life Sciences, Personal Care and Specialty Additives, as well as a variety of external customers. It is not today a major profit center.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is growth, though Ashland won’t be a greyhound</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 2025 <a href=\"https://investor.ashland.com/static-files/c79f4254-f8c1-422c-80a4-32e84ac37507\" rel=\"nofollow\">Innovation Day presentation</a> made the case for a number of significant opportunities across the platforms. Notable highlights include:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Bioresorbable polymers and other injectables, the $750m market for which is growing at 7%. Ashland is targeting a share of 15-20%.</li> <li>Tablet coatings, a $360m market growing at 3%, where they believe they can target second place at 15-25% share.</li> <li>Super wetting agents for coatings, a $280m market growing at 3-4%, where the company currently has no material presence but expects to get to at least a 10% share in time</li> <li>TVO metalworking fluids, a $400m market with mid-single digit growth and a potential share of 10-30%</li> <li>TVO dielectric EV battery coatings, currently a $550m market growing at 9%, with a targeted share of 10-30%.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I don't believe that any of these opportunities is going to individually transform Ashland into a high-multiple growth stock, they do illustrate that the company has a runway for growth across a range of disciplines.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ashland is arguably a more coherent entity than a few years ago, although some cyclicality remains</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, one of the striking things from this presentation was the extent to which today’s Ashland has a degree of integration right across the company. For example, all three of the main divisions sell products based on Cellulosics (39% of total company sales in FY25) and PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidones, 25% of total sales). Furthermore, these two categories now amount to a combined <a href=\"https://investor.ashland.com/static-files/6915b9d4-9fac-4f1e-97f9-a2a6d78b5c18\" rel=\"nofollow\">64% of total sales</a>, whereas as recently as FY20, this was <a href=\"https://investor.ashland.com/static-files/5ff618dd-3f13-48e8-a39f-b962eb2e592e\" rel=\"nofollow\">only 51%</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another illustration of this phenomenon is this slide showing three highlighted areas of new product development: transformed vegetable oil (TVO), wetting agents, and neutralizers:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772121735706115_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1221\" data-height=\"659\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772121735706115_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Ashland technology performance and breadth across segments\" width=\"640\" height=\"345\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"345\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772121735706115_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772121735706115_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772121735706115_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772121735706115_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ashland Innovation Day</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, it is noteworthy that all management expects all three main divisions to benefit from innovation in these areas (CASE is Coatings, Adhesive, Sealings and Elastomers which is primarily within Speciality Additives).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, there is no escaping the fact that there are still areas that periodically suffer from cyclical weakness, such as the Specialty Additives exposure to the Chinese coatings and construction market, which has been weighing on results in recent quarters. Plant outages both at Ashland and its customers also rather muddied the waters in the most recent quarter. Also worth noting is that the presentation acknowledges that the construction part of Specialty Additives is merely <a href=\"https://investor.ashland.com/static-files/c79f4254-f8c1-422c-80a4-32e84ac37507\" rel=\"nofollow\">an area to ‘optimize’</a>, rather than grow (discussed later).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cost discipline is helpful, but not a complete game-changer</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the <a href=\"https://investor.ashland.com/static-files/07e96564-e37b-4298-9c80-f969d66be3f9\" rel=\"nofollow\">December 2024 strategy day</a>, management outlined a program of $90 million of cost savings to be executed from FY25 to FY27. The first $30 million tranche was exceeded in FY25 and the progress so far for FY26 is essentially on target, with $50-55 million of savings from cellulosic and PVV plant optimization and potential for around $5 million of upside if Chinese markets modestly recover. Although not transformative, in the context of consensus EBITDA of $405 million for FY26 (with updated guidance at 1Q26 of a range of $400-420 million), clearly these amounts are material.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These ongoing capital efficiency efforts predate the building by an activist investor of a significant position, although it remains to be seen if this becomes a bone of contention.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">There’s a new shareholder in town</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Standard Investments, the investment arm of privately held Standard Industries, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4526973-ashland-gains-as-standard-investments-discloses-stake-of-57\">emerged on 1 December 2025</a> as a shareholder with economic exposure to Ashland of 9.9% of the shares in December. Shares rose sharply on the day and are now up around 19% from the close the day before the announcement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, the share price response is principally due to Standard Investments’ recent track record as an activist in the sector, for example, the prolonged engagement with the UK’s Johnson Matthey plc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JMPLY\" title=\"Johnson Matthey Plc\">JMPLY</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JMPLF\" title=\"Johnson Matthey Plc\">JMPLF</a>), which started in 2022. This culminated in a public and frank exchange of views over the company’s strategy from December 2024, which was followed a few months later by Johnson Matthey’s <a href=\"https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/uk/johnson_matthey/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=289&amp;newsid=1946537\" rel=\"nofollow\">sale of its leading catalytic converter business</a> to Honeywell (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HON\" title=\"Honeywell International Inc.\">HON</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">News of the Johnson Matthey/Honeywell deal prompted a 30% rise in the former’s share price in one day, with sustained strength since then (at least until the announcement a few days ago that the agreement may founder without a much lower sale price).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors should also be aware that another arm of Standard Industries made the <a href=\"https://www.standardindustries.com/standard-industries-holdings-to-acquire-grace/\" rel=\"nofollow\">outright cash purchase</a> of catalyst and materials technologies specialist W.R. Grace at a steep premium of 59%, having held a 14.9% stake prior to that takeover deal. And so clearly Standard Industries is a very serious participant in the specialty chemicals space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this overall context, it isn’t surprising that Ashland’s shares rose sharply on the news of the activist investor’s stake. Some caution is warranted, however. Following a sustained period of disposals of non-core businesses and other portfolio pruning and expansion, it’s arguably not entirely obvious what major, comparable shake-up (to that of Johnson Matthey) Standard Industries might be able to persuade or pressurize management into pursuing. A possible candidate is the disposal or wind-down of the construction business, given its apparent non-core status, as mentioned earlier.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The valuation is still intriguing</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the recent jump in the shares, in my view, the shares still look somewhat attractively valued.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In absolute terms, at $62.42 and with consensus EPS for FY26 at $3.92, Ashland trades at around 16x 2026 earnings and 15.2x 12m forward earnings, slightly towards the lower end of its post-Valvoline range (spin-off completed in 2017). This is despite the company still experiencing what may be trough earnings in parts of the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772123305241823_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2400\" data-height=\"1240\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772123305241823_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Ashland fwd P/E since Valvoline spin\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"331\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772123305241823_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772123305241823_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772123305241823_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-1772123305241823_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Ashland forward 12m P/E <span>(Koyfin)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a peer-group relative basis, the shares again look potentially interesting.

As you can see, specialty chemical peers that achieve mid-teens to low 20% EBITDA margins tend to be awarded double-digit EV/EBITDA multiples. The exceptions are Axalta Coating Systems (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXTA\" title=\"Axalta Coating Systems Ltd.\">AXTA</a>), currently the subject of a merger proposal with Akzo Nobel NV (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AKZOF\" title=\"Akzo Nobel N.V.\">AKZOF</a>), (AXZOY), and Ashland.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the market were to change its mind and reward Ashland with, say, an 11x EBITDA multiple, the potential upside is to $73.30, around a 17% return.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Most intriguingly, forward estimates for Free Cash Flow suggest a significant valuation anomaly. Here are consensus estimates for the group on a forward-looking basis:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-17721252924710388_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1051\" data-height=\"322\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-17721252924710388_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Ashland and peers free cash flow forecasts\" width=\"640\" height=\"196\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"196\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-17721252924710388_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-17721252924710388_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-17721252924710388_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/13786992-17721252924710388_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Ashland and peers forecast free cash flow yield <span>(Koyfin)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notably, Ashland has the highest FCF yield.

Despite the GenAI wave starting around 2022, the <strong class=\"paywall-full-content\">overall growth</strong><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> of the tech world has not changed significantly over the past 3 years or so, as will be shown later in this article. A similar growth trajectory has been the case for Microsoft's total sales growth. Even though the last quarter's earnings reported by MSFT in late January have been more positive than I expected at my </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824614-microsoft-no-big-catalyst-in-sight-amid-ai-bubbling\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">last coverage</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">, the revenue growth average has been at a similar level in the mid-14 for the past 3 and 5 years. I will continue to keep the HOLD rating for now, but the stock price looks more interesting for the long-term investors who still have faith in US technology dominance for the reasons explained below.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Company Recent Update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a predominant industry leader in enterprise IT, Microsoft has maintained its formidable market leadership for a long time, thanks largely to the cloud offerings, which have been strengthened by the AI infrastructure arms race since 2023. Microsoft reported a cloud revenue of $51.5 billion in the last quarter (Q2 of fiscal year 2026), which represented a rapid 26% year-over-year increase. Azure in particular reported an astonishing 39% revenue spike in 2026, driven by huge AI cloud demand for both inference and training workloads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we look at the overall cloud landscape, Azure has jumped from a distant second public cloud service provider behind Amazon's AWS to a very close second. Azure now holds about 23-28% of the <a href=\"https://turbo360.com/blog/azure-market-share\" rel=\"nofollow\">global cloud market</a>, compared to AWS at 29-31%. I suspect it could surpass AWS in 2026 if a similar growth rate as we have seen in the last quarter can be maintained for a few more quarters down the road.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Organic overall growth in the IT space could be slightly better than I expected. The most recent 17% growth in revenue and the outlook of around mid-teens are still within the range of the updated estimates for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the heavy investment in AI infrastructure is now at three times the revenue growth rate. The most recent quarterly CapEx spending reached $37.5 billion, a 66% increase year-over-year. Such CapEx spending will continue to eat into its margin in the long run. The current gross margin stands at 68.59%, which is not too bad but is at the lower end of a high-margin software-centric company, which typically stays above 70%. For example, Salesforce is at 77%, while META is at an amazing 82% as a comparison. The year 2026 might be a make-or-break year for Microsoft's Enterprise AI growth push. The \"break\" case will be such that the AI's stuff would not make much of a difference in the long-term IT technology growth, as hyped.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>What's happening in the IT space?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, Microsoft's record spending still demonstrates the company's confidence in future AI growth in the enterprise IT space. This is largely backed by its strong financial results achieved in the past quarters. In fact, the gross margin has remained at a respectable level of 68%, close to 70%, as indicated earlier. As long as such a margin can be maintained, the record CapEx spending should be viewed as a positive sign for growth in the enterprise IT space, at least for one or two years</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gartner has recently forecasted the worldwide<a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2025-10-22-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-it-spending-to-grow-9-point-8-percent-in-2026-exceeding-6-trillion-dollars-for-the-first-time#:~:text=Gartner%20Forecasts%20Worldwide%20IT%20Spending,Trillion%20For%20the%20First%20Time\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\"> IT spending</a> to be $6.08 trillion in 2026, which represents a growth of 9.8% from 2025. Under such IT spending conditions, I believe MSFT should be able to keep its growth momentum in 2026 and possibly 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There has been a significant growth scare in the IT (software) space due to the so-called AI disruption. I think that the enterprise AI adoption cycle may not show a big difference from the previous upgrade cycles, such as cloud computing or big data, etc., although AI may sound much more \"exotically\" disruptive. Gartner's <strong>9.8%</strong> growth in IT spending in 2026, as indicated in the above link, shows a more progressive growth landscape for all the key IT players in this space, including Microsoft. I see AI as going to be a different but just a <em><strong>normal</strong> </em>IT growth cycle that's driven by new technology, as always. The corresponding stock market will ultimately reflect it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Microsoft's recent growth estimates have been updated slightly upwards, above 15%, as shown below</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/44152406-17717521912976093.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"307\" height=\"119\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/44152406-17717521912976093.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>MSFT <span></span></span>earnings projections<span> (SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This represents a similar growth increase (around 9%) from the previous update and is in line with Gartner's enterprise software spending (15.2%) increase forecast in 2026. On the surface, I believe the estimates appear to be pretty low (or reasonable) bars to beat if we still believe the AI tailwinds. On the other hand, we may see the AI capex spending will start to drop rather significantly sometime in 2026 for Microsoft. In other words, AI software applications and use cases have to step up the growth pace to the next level to justify the infrastructure built out. Unfortunately, this has not been the case for all existing key players in the software space. And the stock market has taken big notice of it recently.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The valuation is more reasonable but still not attractive.</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The growth has been pretty much at a similar level as shown earlier. The stock price itself was pretty much overvalued at above 500; see the history of my coverages in MSFT below:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/44152406-17721793417804246.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824614-microsoft-no-big-catalyst-in-sight-amid-ai-bubbling\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"217\" height=\"352\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's MSFT coverages (SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now it is at the level of two years ago, around $400, which was roughly where I started my first HOLD rating on MSFT. I am not surprised to see such pricing actions in the market from the longer-term perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, from the short-term perspective, many investors may think that the stock price could have been harshly penalized due to the recent software growth scare. However, with the two-year growth factored in, I think the price is at a more reasonable level, with the PEG ratio representing a much smaller premium (17.54%) over the IT sector mean:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/44152406-17721800362676578_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"680\" data-height=\"238\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/44152406-17721800362676578_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA MSFT data\" width=\"640\" height=\"224\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/44152406-17721800362676578_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/44152406-17721800362676578_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/44152406-17721800362676578_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/44152406-17721800362676578_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>MSFT <span></span></span>Valuation<span> Metrics (SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If I use the 5-year average as a reference, the premium has dropped by over 29%. This is perhaps one of the reasons why an insider has purchased shares. Insider buys have typically been rare events for growth stocks such as MSFT.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, given the recent sharp pullback of the technology stocks, many software companies represent a deep PEG discount. Salesforce, mentioned earlier, has a PEG discount of -42.96%. Some of the other names will be covered soon by my future writing-up. I would still rate MSFT as a HOLD at the current level. It may perform as the market in 2026 when the market sentiment on the technology improves. I would recommend looking for other, more promising price recovery opportunities in this space.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risk Analysis</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the case of the slowing IT spending, MSFT's price would suffer much more than the current pullback. Keep in mind that Gartner's software spending growth was slightly reduced for 2026 in the IT estimation mentioned earlier. Whether this would form a trend of much slowing to happen remains to be seen. But it is not a good start.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, the key risk in the IT space at the moment has been the AI infrastructure build-up. The record CapEx spending could eat up the margin very quickly, and the whole AI investing story could be crushed in a hurry if the software side has not shown in 2026 the accelerated growth to catch up with the AI cycle expectations. So far Microsoft has done well with the earnings numbers. The company is required to keep the growth momentum going at least in the next 12 months.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Closing</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite leading the AI technology cycle, Microsoft's stock price has not shown much in the last two years, at around $400. It has a clear advantage in building AI cloud infrastructure to start with, as Microsoft Azure is still seeing 39% growth at the moment. But the main area of enterprise IT software has not shown any obvious sign yet of meaningful, accelerated growth from the AI tailwind. MSFT could serve as a solid long-term hold for typical technology growth at the mid-teens level. The overheated AI hype, on the other hand, may serve as a headwind for the stock price to recover in 2026. I will keep the HOLD rating on MSFT and watch the stock price closely in 2026.</p>",

While some insurers may have worked inflationary concerns into their revised rates post-tariffs, consumers are unlikely to see related rates lowered now, Newsome said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"I don't think any insurer really changed prices because of the tariff, and I don't think if [the tariffs] go away, you'll see much of an impact as well,\" Newsome said. \"I think the insurance industry will just kind of keep trucking along, and you won't see much of an impact either way.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944718.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shares In U.S. Insurers Make Light Of Supreme Court Tariff Ruling\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"660\" height=\"462\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944718.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944718.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944718.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944718.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Tariff ruling</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a 6-3 ruling <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/24-1287_4gcj.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">released Feb. 20</a>, the Supreme Court held that the Trump administration exceeded its authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose wide-ranging global tariffs, calling much of the administration's economic policy into question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the ruling, Trump has doubled down on the tariffs, signing Feb. 20 an executive order that imposes the 10% tariffs under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. Those went into effect Feb. 24, and Trump has subsequently threatened to raise the tariffs to 15%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some companies in the retail and imports sectors have filed lawsuits seeking reimbursements for tariffs paid to the US government. While those lawsuits remain ongoing, if refunds materialize, insurers are unlikely to be recipients, according to Newsome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"Companies have to show how they were directly impacted, and because insurers are not actually importing or exporting anything, I would be surprised if any saw refunds,\" Newsome said.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Impacts vary by sector</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insurance and insurance-adjacent sectors such as healthcare and asset management reacted differently to the Supreme Court decision, but after a few days, there were only a couple of percentage points difference in terms of overall performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the insurance sector has been largely insulated against the tariffs, the property and casualty sector has some more exposure due to its reliance on imported parts for home and vehicle repairs, among other things susceptible to inflationary pressures, Newsome said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"When you start looking at where tariffs would potentially create inflation, it's there, but it's just proportionally not as big as other [financial sectors],\" Newsome said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even with the unpredictable ups and downs, Newsome expects insurers to emerge from this period of volatility in a good position. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944720.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shares In U.S. Insurers Make Light Of Supreme Court Tariff Ruling\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"660\" height=\"462\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944720.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944720.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944720.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944720.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2026/2/shares-in-us-insurers-make-light-of-supreme-court-tariff-ruling-99108701\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

Japan, by contrast, was an isolated feudal backwater, intentionally cut off from the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> rest of the world since the beginning of the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1603.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Faced with the obvious technical superiority of the West as they stared down the cannon barrels of Perry’s Black Ships, Japan’s leaders realized that nothing short of a far-reaching transformation away from the ossified practices of the ruling samurai class was going to be required.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Via the Meiji Restoration that began in 1868, they succeeded. By the end of the nineteenth century, Japan was a modernized industrial power carving out its own empire to compete with those of its Western peers. In 1905 it defeated one of those peers, the czarist empire of Russia, in the Russo-Japanese War and thus firmly established itself as a player in the great-power politics of the age.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Takaichi Trade</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The point of that little history lesson is that one should never count out Japan and its ability to reinvent itself. For the past thirty-odd years it has been easy to dismiss Japan as a once-strong economy whose time has come and gone. The Nikkei 225 stock index failed to regain its 1989 high point until 2024, 35 years later.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demography, deflation and debt summed up an economy listlessly drifting its way into senescence, stubbornly clinging to a shopworn model while the rest of the world raced ahead with successive generations of game-changing technologies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But recently, the country seems to have shaken off the malaise of these so-called lost decades. That long-suffering Nikkei 225 index has gone from also-ran to world-beating over the past twelve months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_chart_02_27_26.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nikkei 225\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"927\" height=\"572\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_chart_02_27_26.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_chart_02_27_26.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_chart_02_27_26.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_chart_02_27_26.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_chart_02_27_26.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A good portion of this outperformance can be attributed to the emergence of a new political star. Sanae Takaichi is a rarity in the world of Japanese politics in two ways: first, she is a woman, the first of her gender to attain the office of prime minister; and, second, that she is wildly popular.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Her initial victory last October sent the Nikkei surging, even as the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that she heads struggled to piece together a coalition government. It surged again earlier this month when a snap election audaciously called by Takaichi resulted in an LDP victory of historic proportions and a clear green light for the new government to move ahead with its mandate for sweeping economic reform.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Takaichi Trap</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That mandate, though, is not without some potential headwinds. The Takaichi government seeks to implement a major stimulus program to reinvigorate industry, catalyze consumer spending (for example, by eliminating a consumption tax on food products) and establish a stronger geopolitical presence in the region.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This last item, which implies a big investment in Japan’s defense industry, has already created some waves after Takaichi made some supportive remarks in favor of Taiwan, remarks that provoked pointed criticism from China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the stimulus measures, they are going to have to contend with the Bank of Japan’s attempts to normalize monetary policy and keep a lid on inflation, which has made a somewhat surprising return in the past couple of years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Japanese bond yields have experienced some wobbles of late, as investors try to figure out how the BoJ and the Takaichi government are going to harmonize their respective agendas.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Remembering Shimonoseki</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is, of course, possible that the best-laid plans of the Takaichi government will fail in its attempts to re-establish Japan as a highly productive and energetic economy with world-class products and services. But, as we noted above, it is never wise to count the country out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reaching even farther back into the annals of history, in the late thirteenth century Japan was besieged by the superpower of the day, the Mongol empire of Kublai Khan. After a first encounter in which the Mongols gained some territory but then backed off to regroup, the Japanese built fortified protections strong enough to withstand future assaults.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Attack again the Mongol fleet did, but it failed to penetrate the fortifications, and while the fleet was stranded in the straits of Shimonoseki trying to advance, it was destroyed by a great typhoon – the “divine wind” the Japanese translation of which is “kamikaze.” The Mongols never attacked again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Japan is a highly conservative society with a pronounced resistance to change. But when it puts its mind to it, the country has shown in the past that it is capable of remarkable change in a very short period of time. As nations around the world grope for position in the changing global order, it may be time to give Japan another, closer look.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><a href=\"https://mvfinancial.com/news/mv-weekly-market-flash-japan-rises-again/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Original Post</a></em></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

However, Wall Street expects Q1 revenues to hover around $218 million, which is a significant growth of 72% YoY, driven by the combined revenues from Enfusion and Beacon. Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA margin may settle over 34% due to replacing the traditional jobs with AI, plus the rapid success in achieving operational synergies, which is expected to generate cash flows of $60 million.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><span>Valuation</span></strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since CWAN is currently trading at a $6.86 billion market cap and it has debts of $822.6 million and cash of $91 million, the EV is estimated at $7.6 billion. Considering that 2025 revenues are $731 million while 2026 revenues are estimated at $946 million, the EV/revenue of the company is around 8x-10x. Given the closest competitor, SS&amp;C Technologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNC\" title=\"SS&amp;C Technologies Holdings, Inc.\">SSNC</a>), which trades at a multiple of 4x, CWAN seems optically overvalued. But SSNC is a mature company and growing at a slower pace of approximately 7%. While the valuation gap favors CWAN because it relies completely on a pure cloud SaaS and grows at a faster rate of approximately 30%, therefore the market gives CWAN a premium based on its rapid growth, putting pressure on it to maintain this performance in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bae614dadfcd6bb9b56e8251a503d640.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bae614dadfcd6bb9b56e8251a503d640.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bae614dadfcd6bb9b56e8251a503d640.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bae614dadfcd6bb9b56e8251a503d640.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_8cfaaa2cfdffa70593e3f014551d8ded.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_8cfaaa2cfdffa70593e3f014551d8ded.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_8cfaaa2cfdffa70593e3f014551d8ded.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_8cfaaa2cfdffa70593e3f014551d8ded.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><span>Risks To Consider</span></strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>The company faces a set of risks, the first of which is the failure of the acquisition deal. Although the company obtained early termination of the waiting period under the HSR antitrust law, the major deals may collapse for one reason or another, as a sudden financing crisis may prevent the private funds from arranging the required loans for the deal. </span><span>Or a minority shareholder such as Starboard may vote against the deal if they think </span><span>that</span><span> the proposed price undervalues them; consequently, the stock may witness a violent downward</span><span> reaction from arbitrage funds, which will immediately liquidate their portfolios.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Also, merging the three entities Enfusion, Beacon, and Bistro with the company wouldn't be an easy mission, as integrating the cultures, databases, and programming languages is a very complex process for any management. If the integration efforts fail, this can lead to a temporary decline in the profit margins or even distract the management from core sales, which could push customers to flee to competitors.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Despite the optimism </span><span>of</span><span> Agentic AI capabilities, the accounting and asset management sector is </span><span>very</span><span> sensitive to errors; thus, any random error resulting from AI malfunctions could lead to data fabrications or </span><span>presenting</span><span> false information to regulators and central banks, </span><span>which</span><span> could expose clients to hefty fines.</span><span> While the company's business model operates in a very strict and regulated environment, this risk remains.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59349569-17721841639556403_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2258\" data-height=\"542\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59349569-17721841639556403_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CWAN 10-K Report\" width=\"640\" height=\"154\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59349569-17721841639556403_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59349569-17721841639556403_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59349569-17721841639556403_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59349569-17721841639556403_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>CWAN 10-K Report</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Final Thoughts</span></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Clearwater Analytics offers a unique technology </span><span>in order</span><span> to be the beating heart of $10 </span><span>trillion; </span><span>it is</span><span> also </span><span>able to free</span><span> its clients from bureaucratic labor.</span><span> The fruits of these advancements were evident in Q4 results, which jumped by 72%.

Last year, Chord set a goal of converting 80% of its inventory to long laterals. I'm happy to report that we achieved that goal by year-end 2025, which was earlier than expected, and is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851757128527.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chord Energy IR CHRD stock analysis seekingalpha valuation best oil stocks to buy 2026\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"633\" height=\"893\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851757128527.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851757128527.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851757128527.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Chord Energy IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financially, based on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CHRD/sec-filings\">CHRD’s latest report</a>, we see a strong balance sheet, with a net leverage of ~0.6x as of the latest report, and also no maturities until all the way in 2030 (and 2033), which I believe leaves significant room for more debt if they want to ramp up their expansion through another big acquisition or other developments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759407637_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1269\" data-height=\"729\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759407637_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chord Energy IR CHRD stock analysis seekingalpha valuation best oil stocks to buy 2026\" width=\"640\" height=\"368\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759407637_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759407637_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759407637_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759407637_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Chord Energy IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding Chord’s capital returns, I remain a big fan of their balanced approach, with the company prioritizing their balance sheet and leverage over returns, targeting 75%+ of adjusted FCF while the leverage is below 0.5x, 50%+ while the leverage is below 1x (nowadays), or just the base dividend plus potential for other returns when the leverage is above 1x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a note, their selected peers currently stand at a leverage of 1.1x, while the SPDR S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Expl &amp; Prod ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOP\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Expl &amp; Prod ETF\">XOP</a>) is at 1.7x, so the fact that they are well below that and are still taking a very careful approach remains yet another factor that highlights their quality, in my opinion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the Q4 performance, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557362-chord-energy-declares-1_30-dividend\">CHRD has recently declared a $1.30/share quarterly dividend</a> (the base), which places them at a roughly 5% yield today, representing roughly $295 million per year, alongside $10 million in buybacks for the quarter, for a very solid ~48% payout ratio, in line with the target. However, if we assume an improvement in leverage and a 75% payout ratio on the $700 million FCF they expect in 2026, we’re talking about $525 million in total, meaning a yield of roughly 9%, which is not bad at all in such an environment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Macro Developments</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To update a key development started in the previous analysis, I want to begin this segment by quickly mentioning the situation in Venezuela. Under the current conditions, I believe Exxon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>) characterized Venezuela’s oil landscape very well when they <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/09/venezuela-is-uninvestible-for-now-exxon-ceo-tells-trump-in-white-house-meeting-00720198\" rel=\"nofollow\">called it “uninvestable,”</a> as we should keep in mind that it’s true that the country’s oil reserves are massive, but any operations there will require massive investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After all, we’re not only talking about one of the heaviest oils on the planet (lots of refining needed), but the infrastructure there is very old, likely the remnants of what American companies left there before they were nationalized (in 1976), with some upgrades made over time. In this oil environment, it’s very hard to find the funds (CAPEX-cutting environment) and the risk appetite to develop something in the country.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sure, things can improve in the long term and <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/venezuelas-acting-president-signs-overhaul-easing-state-control-of-oil-industry-into-law\" rel=\"nofollow\">the country is working on an overhaul of their oil industry</a> after Maduro was removed, but nothing guarantees that these operations <a href=\"https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2026/01/five-keys-to-understanding-venezuelas-oil-history/#:~:text=Foreign%20companies%20continued,the%2020th%20century\" rel=\"nofollow\">won’t be taken again</a> or economic conditions won’t change. After all, Trump’s term is over in about 3 years, and we can never know who comes to power next (in either country) and potentially cut the US’ grip that’s just now being developed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, there are several other uncertain factors that the market will pay attention to. If things were that simple, then this wouldn’t have been one of the most volatile commodities on the planet, after all. For example, although <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec-likely-maintain-oil-production-pause-march-prices-climb-sources-say-2026-01-26/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OPEC+ continued to go for their previously planned halt in production hikes</a> shortly after the Maduro operation, that’s providing some clarity only until the end of Q1, and a switch here can cause pressure on the price of oil once again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, very <a href=\"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2026/02/25/opec-to-consider-137000-bpd-oil-output-increase-for-april-reuters-sources-say/\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent reports</a> indicate that OPEC+ may decide to raise oil output by 137,000 bpd starting in April 2026 in order to meet peak summer demand, which can be only the beginning of more near-term pressure on the price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the situation in Iran is also developing, while the war in Ukraine is taking steps towards an eventual end, which can even lead to somewhat of the opposite of the price jumps, disruptions, and sanctions that came afterward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regardless, even before the current situation, we saw J.P. Morgan’s warning saying that we could even see <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4525655-brent-crude-could-slide-to-the-30s-without-production-cuts-jp-morgan-says\">oil drop into the $30s by 2027</a> in a massive oversupply scenario, which could be terrible for a company like CHRD, as the <a href=\"https://ir.chordenergy.com/2025-09-15-Chord-Energy-Announces-Strategic-Acquisition-of-Williston-Basin-Assets#:~:text=Inventory%20Quality%3A%C2%A0Low%20average%20NYMEX%20WTI%20breakeven%20economics%20%28%2440s%29%20compete%20at%20the%20front%2Dend%20of%20Chord%27s%20program%20and%20lower%20the%20weighted%2Daverage%20breakeven%20of%20Chord%27s%20portfolio%3B\" rel=\"nofollow\">Williston Basin inventory acquired recently,</a> for example, has a breakeven in the $40s.

Morgan also has more “normal” outlooks that seem to be in line with OPEC’s halt, <a href=\"https://energynow.com/2025/11/jpmorgan-projects-brent-crude-at-57-a-barrel-wti-at-53-in-2027/\" rel=\"nofollow\">estimating</a> Brent prices of $58 and WTI at $54 in 2026, followed by $57 and $53 in 2027, respectively, which still makes CHRD very profitable.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks Reiterated</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, CHRD remains tied to the prices of their commodities, and if we see oil drop to the mid-to-high $50s as JPM expects, we are talking about quite a big drop for CHRD's FCF, as the company's breakeven costs lead to massive swings at these levels, with their FCF yield being estimated at 5% with WTI prices at $55, 16% at $70, and 25% at $85.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This also means that volatility is something we should assume from the start, as the commodity will depend a lot on politics, speculation, outlooks, news, etc., which can lead to rapid swings in near-term valuations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851752504742_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"658\" data-height=\"335\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851752504742_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chord Energy IR CHRD stock analysis seekingalpha valuation best oil stocks to buy 2026\" width=\"640\" height=\"326\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851752504742_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851752504742_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851752504742_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851752504742_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Calculations</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For CHRD’s DCF to Equity valuation, starting from their expected $700 million in FCF in 2026 (assuming average prices of $64 WTI and $3.75 HH for the entire period) without accounting for any change in net borrowings since I want to highlight their “pure” potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result of the mix of synergies, laterals expansion, and other savings that they're delivering, I'll assume that the CAPEX remains flat at $700 million in 2027 as well, followed by a jump to $1.20 billion in 2028 as the CAPEX could drop and they should be able to reap the benefits of their investments, followed by a CAGR of 3.5% until 2035 and a 2.5% terminal growth rate, with a relatively high discount rate of 12.5% to take into account their basin exposure risks and volatility, with 56.84 million shares outstanding as of their Q4 report.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This way, we get to an equity value of $11.12 billion, for an intrinsic value of $195.68 per share, which is significantly above the current $105.38.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759758248.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chord Energy IR CHRD stock analysis seekingalpha valuation best oil stocks to buy 2026\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"620\" height=\"298\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759758248.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759758248.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759758248.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Calculations</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I’ll also try to gauge the current market estimates, just to get an idea about the difference between CHRD’s potential and the current valuation. If we start with their $700 million FCF in 2026 and, instead of the previous jump, assume a 4% CAGR until 2030, a 3% CAGR until 2035, and a 2.25% terminal growth rate, with a 15% discount rate and 56.84 million shares outstanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This gets us to an intrinsic value of $103.39, which almost perfectly mirrors the current level, taking into account a massive discount rate and weak growth despite the company’s achievements, which I don’t consider correct.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CHRD remains a Strong Buy, being in a very solid financial position, with prudent management that’s been delivering great improvements in recent years and a solid yield on top.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are risks to keep in mind, as their breakeven costs are still elevated given the basin exposure, but the company is advancing rapidly in a very good direction, transforming significantly since it was formed, which I believe should warrant better valuations going forward.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a final note, especially given <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4545336-devon-energy-coterra-energy-to-merge-in-all-stock-deal-valued-at-58b\">the continued M&amp;A activity seen in the market</a>, I wouldn’t be surprised to see another peer try to acquire CHRD given the valuation, quality, and size.</p>",
