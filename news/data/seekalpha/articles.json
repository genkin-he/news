(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a></span>) reported strong <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511707-amazon-gaap-eps-of-1_95-beats-by-0_39-revenue-of-180_2b-beats-by-2_44b\">Q3 results</a> on Thursday, showing particularly compelling AWS results. The company's shares surged by double-digits following the earnings release, as the market was happy about the company's<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> profitability trajectory. Relative to the more expensive Magnificent 7 stocks, AMZN looks like a solid value, but it isn't a must-own investment at a price of $250, as some other big tech players look even better.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Past Coverage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have written about Amazon.com here on Seeking Alpha in the past, with my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4807482-amazon-post-earnings-slump-justified\">most recent article</a> being from three months ago. I gave AMZN a neutral rating back then, which worked out well so far -- on the day of the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20287289-amazon-com-announces-third-quarter-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">Q3 release</a>, AMZN was up 3% from one quarter earlier, which is a decent return, but a little less than what investors got from the broad market. With one quarter having passed since my last article on Amazon, and with AMZN reporting its Q3 results on Thursday, it is time to update my views on the company.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Happened?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During regular trading hours, Amazon.com was down 3% on Thursday, pulling back with the broad market and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust ETF\">QQQ</a>). But in after-hours trading, AMZN is up by a hefty 13% at the time of writing -- the result of the following <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511707-amazon-gaap-eps-of-1_95-beats-by-0_39-revenue-of-180_2b-beats-by-2_44b\">earnings release</a>:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/28873105-17618604269745526.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon.com Q3 earnings release\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"617\" height=\"111\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/28873105-17618604269745526.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/28873105-17618604269745526.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/28873105-17618604269745526.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/28873105-17618604269745526.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/28873105-17618604269745526.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/28873105-17618604269745526.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/28873105-17618604269745526.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/28873105-17618604269745526.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Amazon.com Q3 earnings release <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We see that AMZN beat estimates on both lines, which is always a good thing. The revenue beat wasn't very large, at roughly 1%, but earnings per share trounced estimates, with AMZN's bottom-line number coming in 25% ahead of what Wall Street analysts were forecasting -- AMZN hit the highest analyst estimate perfectly. This was Amazon's fifth double beat in a row, but it was the biggest profit beat in absolute terms, which could explain why investors were so happy with AMZN's earnings report, although I believe that Amazon's consolidating share price in the recent past may also help explain the positive reaction -- the market didn't seem very enthusiastic about Amazon going into this earnings report.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon.com: Strong Profitability</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon's company-wide revenue growth of 13% was appealing, I believe. After all, Amazon's gigantic revenues in absolute terms make it quite hard to maintain a very high relative growth rate -- considering this, I think that the 13% revenue increase is very solid, even though tech peers like Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) and Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) have reported better relative growth for the third quarter. During the second quarter, revenues had grown by 13% as well, thus we can say that there is neither significant positive nor significant negative momentum on a company-wide scale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon's business is split into three main sections, which can differ quite a lot when it comes to growth, profitability, etc. Amazon's biggest unit in terms of revenue generation is the U.S. retail business, where around 60% of company-wide revenue is being generated. The U.S. business grew by 11%, relative to one year earlier, which was in line with the growth rate one quarter earlier -- no big surprise here. The international business grew a little faster, at 14% versus the previous year's quarter, which is partially due to a weakening U.S. Dollar -- on a currency-neutral basis, the international segment grew by 10%, which is more or less in line with the U.S. business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon's growth star, of course, is AWS: During the third quarter, the unit saw sales expand to $33 billion, which made for a 20% increase versus one year earlier. Considering this is now a ~$130 billion a year tech unit, a 20% annual growth rate seems quite compelling to me. Here, we also saw positive momentum: AWS's growth rate was 18% during the second quarter, thus, growth did not only remain strong, it actually accelerated. That bodes well for the current quarter and 2026, I think, assuming Amazon can maintain positive momentum. Since AWS offers some AI exposure, the ongoing AI trend/hype seems to have a positive impact on Amazon's highest-margin business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue growth is good, but investors want to see profits, of course. Here, Amazon did well, too -- at least if we correct Amazon's reported numbers for some one-time items. Operating profit was $17.4 billion for the third quarter, in line with one year earlier. But that was due to two one-time items that \"hide\" Amazon's underlying profit growth. The company settled a legal issue with the FTC, which cost $2.5 billion, and the company experienced a charge of $1.8 billion for the planned massive layoffs that were announced a couple of days ago. Backing out those two items, Amazon would have generated an operating profit of $21.7 billion, which would mean growth of 25% versus one year earlier. Not only is that a pretty nice growth rate in general, it also means that AMZN's margins expanded nicely -- the operating profit growth rate was almost twice as high as the revenue growth rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was, not surprisingly, partially driven by growing AWS profits, but Amazon's retail business did well, too. Backing out the aforementioned charge, the U.S. business (which is more profitable than the international business) saw profits expand by $1.6 billion over the last year. Low fuel expenses due to low oil prices helped with profitability, but Amazon also benefited from operating leverage that results in margin expansion as the company expands, all else equal. Amazon's AWS profits were up by $1.0 billion, before accounting for layoff expenses, which were not broken down on a business unit basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net income was impacted by the above charges to operating earnings, but also saw a one-time impact from Amazon's stake in AI company Anthropic becoming more valuable -- AMZN booked a $9.5 billion pre-tax gain in Q3, which helps explain how Amazon was able to beat profit estimates so easily.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon's operations are capital-intensive, both for the retail business -- warehouses, trucks, etc. -- as well as for the tech business, where huge data center investments are needed. With Artificial Intelligence investing picking up at AMZN, as well as at its peers, capital expenditures rose substantially over the last year. That's why free cash flows declined, despite operating cash flows improving: Operating cash flows over the last twelve months totaled $131 billion, up 16% over the previous year, but due to capital expenditures of $116 billion over the last year, free cash flow declined to only $15 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For a company that is valued at roughly $2.7 trillion, that's not a lot -- the trailing free cash flow multiple is 180 or so. One can argue that capital expenditures will not always remain this high, and that major AI and data center investments will result in better operating cash flow and profits down the road, but I think that the discrepancy between the company's free cash flows and its market capitalization shouldn't be completely ignored by AMZN bulls.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Is Amazon A Good Investment?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The valuation looks better when we focus on profits instead of free cash flows, but even then, Amazon isn't a bargain. The company is forecasted to earn $6.65 or so this year, with shares trading at around $250 following the earnings release -- this makes for a 38x earnings multiple. Even when we account for some earnings estimate upside revisions in the coming days following AMZN's Q3 earnings beat, the valuation will remain in the mid-to-high-30s. That's not expensive compared to where Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>), Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>), or Tesla (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA\" title=\"Tesla, Inc.\">TSLA</a>) are trading -- but Magnificent 7 peers Meta Platforms and Alphabet are considerably cheaper, despite growing even faster than Amazon.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That is why I'm not an AMZN bull at current prices: With cheaper, faster-growing tech giants with AI exposure available today, I see more value elsewhere -- that doesn't mean that AMZN is a bad company at all, just that it is a less opportune investment compared to alternatives.</p>",

As the chart below clearly depicts, Microsoft has managed to deliver operating profits as consistently and predictably as one could expect. This is the result, in my view, of Microsoft's transition to what is now mostly a SaaS- and subscription-based business model under the leadership of Satya Nadella.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I wrote in a Microsoft article that is now about seven years old, \"recurring revenue offers revenue predictability\" and \"the stock market [...] places a higher value on predictable recurring revenue as it translates into meaningful valuation.\" Yes, Microsoft's F1Q was impressive as a stand-alone quarter. But more importantly, it helped to cement the idea that the company, even at a massive scale, can still deliver what I believe to be what investors value the most: predictable, high-margin, cash-flow-rich results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a perfect segue to the next topic, my perma-bull thesis on MSFT.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c6496acf11b642f8a7061ad5f368ae65.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c6496acf11b642f8a7061ad5f368ae65.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c6496acf11b642f8a7061ad5f368ae65.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c6496acf11b642f8a7061ad5f368ae65.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c6496acf11b642f8a7061ad5f368ae65.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c6496acf11b642f8a7061ad5f368ae65.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c6496acf11b642f8a7061ad5f368ae65.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c6496acf11b642f8a7061ad5f368ae65.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c6496acf11b642f8a7061ad5f368ae65.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Perma-bull Thesis On MSFT</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Microsoft is one of those businesses that I have never turned bearish on, once I understood the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4183655-microsoft-this-might-turn-me-into-a-bull\">value proposition</a> in 2018. This is not to say that I am blind to the risks of investing in the company's equity (although, to be fair, <a href=\"https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;sl=5AFRBwkrg6O9mQ3k9o7jZE\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSFT has historically been the least volatile stock</a> of all within the Mag 7 peer group). It also does not mean that I would never abandon my bull thesis as a matter of loyalty to the company or my convictions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I presented several times in the past, value perception is primarily a function of two factors above any other: risk and growth. On the risk side, the chart immediately above provides a visual representation of how consistently at delivering results, Microsoft has been for many years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a> also helps to support the case. As of the most recent period, Microsoft held nearly $60 billion in net cash, defined here as cash and liquid investments less short- and long-term debt. This is in part why the company can so easily afford to invest in infrastructure to ride the tailwinds of the cloud and AI revolutions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, Microsoft's net working capital (current assets except cash, minus current liabilities except debt) is -$40 billion (net liability positive), which is astounding when coupled with cash flow from operations of $147 billion in the trailing twelve months. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4727705-apple-stock-return-on-invested-capital-producing-massive-amounts-value\">Not unlike its peer</a> Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), this means that Microsoft is able to create lavish amounts of cash \"out of thin air\" â that is, while having its operations financed primarily by its customers and vendors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3f08112b8b4c71faf55c5d33251ef1ce.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3f08112b8b4c71faf55c5d33251ef1ce.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3f08112b8b4c71faf55c5d33251ef1ce.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3f08112b8b4c71faf55c5d33251ef1ce.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3f08112b8b4c71faf55c5d33251ef1ce.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3f08112b8b4c71faf55c5d33251ef1ce.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3f08112b8b4c71faf55c5d33251ef1ce.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3f08112b8b4c71faf55c5d33251ef1ce.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3f08112b8b4c71faf55c5d33251ef1ce.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The growth side of the valuation equation is what I believe more clearly supports my bullish stance. While MSFT's trailing EPS multiple of 38.3x (see above) may keep value investors at bay, merely looking forward a couple of years helps to understand why the share price is likely to grow into a next-year P/E that currently sits at \"only\" 28.7x. With fiscal 2028 P/E at 24.3x today, one of two things must be true: either (1) Microsoft will disappoint analysts and investors and deliver below-consensus EPS going forward, which the company virtually never does, or (2) MSFT stock will more than likely climb towards an EPS valuation above 30x through the next 2â3 years, which is much more reasonable for a stock of this quality.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the reasons outlined above, I maintain my perma-bull stance on MSFT. While a 3% single-session pullback may not be enough to call this a dip-buying opportunity, it is better than nothing: I am accumulating shares on this modest pullback.</p>",

Demand for the AirPods Pro 3 and Apple Watch SE, which had remained flat for several quarters, has indeed returned. The CFO reported $1.1 billion in tariff costs in the quarter, a figure that explains why operating expenses (+11% year-over-year) rose more than expected. Yet, they did not impact profitability, further demonstrating how Apple manages to defend margins even in unfavorable geopolitical environments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The sore point remains the same. The Achilles heel that once accounted for 20% of revenues has now fallen to around 15%. China, the company's third-largest market. This is not the first time we have seen it, yet it is a really unstable market, therefore results in that area frequently decide income. Apple has fallen today in that region. Revenue decreased 3.6% to $14.5 billion, some 12% below analysts' estimates. I believe that while the weight of rivalry was felt, limitations on AI characteristics (not accessible in the nation) also had detrimental consequences. These statistics caused the market to initiate the selloff I previously described, therefore erasing $130 billion in market capitalization within minutes (or seconds).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In any case, I don't believe this is a structural weakness, but rather a temporary effect. Some iPhone 16 and 17 models are still limited by production capacity (management itself has confirmed this), and this explains much of the slowdown in sales. So it's not a question of demand, but of availability, and I believe that in this case, it's better to have a production constraint than a loss of market share. Don't you think so?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"960\" data-height=\"558\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Agar Capital\" width=\"640\" height=\"372\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Agar Capital</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's worth noting, however, that the $1.9 billion decline in sales in China was more than offset, in absolute terms, by sales exceeding $2.3 billion in Europe.

With <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/apple-microsoft-4-trillion-market-cap.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CNBC</a>, Cook mentioned that a \"more personalized\" Siri is in the pipeline for next year and also hinted at additional collaborations with ChatGPT, which indicates a subtle shift towards AI direct monetization.\" ââââââââI was really excited about this, but it's finally coming.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation &amp; Market Reaction</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock's reaction was initially nervous, due to the China shock. Then, the rebound was supported by better-than-expected guidance and margins. Operationally, the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a> remains solid, but I had no doubts about that. Gross margins rose above expectations, operating costs remained under control, and the company continued to aggressively return capital (approximately $90.7 billion in buybacks this year) while keeping the dividend stable at $0.26 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"448\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Agar Capital, Bloomberg\" width=\"640\" height=\"286\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Agar Capital, Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gross cash (cash and short-term securities) is $132 billion in gross cash, meaning there's virtually no need for leverage for any type of investment. The money is there. Simple. This gives management rare freedom. They can continue to return capital to shareholdersâand do so aggressively, with record buybacksâwithout having to sacrifice strategic investments in AI. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 10â12% <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511434-apple-slips-as-iphone-china-sales-fall-short-in-q4\">growth target</a> for the December quarter sounds believable to me and, in my view, draws emphasis away from geographic volatilityâthe \"China case,\" Apple's problem) to margin resilience and the more lucrative service mix, which is expanding in double digits. Personally, I am rather unconcerned about the (temporary) China problemâparticularly if it's connected to supply restrictions (rather than demand) and if sales in Europe, Japan, and APAC compensate well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rating Update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Iââââââââ am not trying to follow the trend of the market. I pass from Buy to Strong Buy. I had already gone the other way, in fact, at one point, I gave it a Sell rating. I was mistaken, I acknowledged it, and I am acknowledging it once again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The recent figures have removed a large part of the doubts that I had. To summarize, demand is stable, margins are solid, and management is working hard, raising the next quarter's ââââââââforecasts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What really changes the situation, for me, are services. They are the engine that brings stability and visibility to Apple's financials. They are growing at a double-digit rate in almost all regions, with margins above 70%. Truly interesting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And then, show me another company that generates around $100 billion in free cash flow each year, with $132 billion in gross cash, and still absorbs over $1 billion in tariff costs without affecting margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On artificial intelligence, I have flip-flipped. A few quarters back I was very skeptical and critical; Apple appears to have made no headway. I wrote it and I shall say it once again. I was not right. The new partnerships outside ChatGPT and the redesigned Siri in 2026 finally offer a believable path toward artificial intelligence's monetization inside the Apple ecosystem. And I'm drawn to that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given its enormous visibility and cash flow, Apple is not pricey at present <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL/valuation/metrics\">price/earnings levels</a>, but it is also not inexpensive either. Should China grow again and if first AI monetization comes, the potential upside results are huge.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"885\" data-height=\"496\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After a quarter like this, the risk isn't buying too early, but staying out. I've made this mistake in the past by reducing my exposure to the stock, thinking I was outsmarting the market and playing for timing. Today, the story is different. Apple has returned to being a story to hold, not to chase. The market was confused after the data was released, but as soon as it had time to better understand the financial data, it shifted toward buying. Margins are solid, services are expanding, and AI is starting to become tangible.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my portfolio, Apple has become a core stock, like in the old days. You purchase on drawdowns and let it work. Because the mix of FCF, cash, and earnings visibility successfully covers the valuation premium, I don't see the risk of multiple compression in the near term.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMG\" title=\"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\">CMG</a></span>). Shares of the company plummeted 18.2% after management <a href=\"https://ir.chipotle.com/2025-10-29-CHIPOTLE-ANNOUNCES-THIRD-QUARTER-2025-RESULTS\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.chipotle.com/2025-10-29-CHIPOTLE-ANNOUNCES-THIRD-QUARTER-2025-RESULTS\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> financial results covering the third quarter of the company's 2025 fiscal year. Revenue fell a<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> bit short of expectations. But earnings per share came in line with what analysts were anticipating. More disappointing than these results, however, was the fact that management reduced guidance for comparable store sales for this year because of consumer headwinds. In the past, I have been more neutral on the business, </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4752475-chipotle-mexican-grill-great-for-tastebuds-not-wallet\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4752475-chipotle-mexican-grill-great-for-tastebuds-not-wallet\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">even reaffirming it</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> as a \"Hold\" candidate back in January of this year. The fact of the matter is that shares were too expensive for my liking, even though I am a huge fan of the restaurant. However, the thing that stopped me from downgrading it to a \"Sell\" was the fact that the company was continuing to achieve impressive growth.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fast forward to today, and things are not going well. The stock is down 45.6% over the last year, with management now warning that comparable restaurant sales will be down this year as opposed to flat. For many investors, this would be an ideal time to cash out and look elsewhere for opportunities. However, I actually think now might be the time to step in and upgrade it. To be clear, the company has difficult days ahead for it, and I fully expect conditions to worsen before they get better. The U<span>nited States</span> is spiraling toward a recession, in my opinion, and I fully anticipate consumer pressures to hurt the company more than they have already. Normally, the kind of valuation that the firm trades at would justify a neutral rating, though just barely. But with the company still focused tremendously on growth and with it having no debt and a huge amount of cash on hand, I think that those who are in it for the long haul should consider it a very soft \"Buy\" candidate.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tough Times</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the market closed on Oct. 29, the management team at Chipotle Mexican Grill announced financial results covering the third quarter of the company's 2025 fiscal year. Revenue for the company came in at $3 billion, which was up from the $2.79 billion reported last year, but it also ended up missing analystsâ <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMG/earnings\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMG/earnings\" target=\"_blank\">expectations</a> by $19.1 million. In the grand scheme of things, this kind of miss is mostly a rounding error. However, when you have a restaurant operator that has historically been priced like a technology company, even meeting expectations can result in downside if the market catches even a whiff of weakness ahead. In short, Chipotle Mexican Grill has been priced for perfection, and it has fallen short of that.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2226\" data-height=\"854\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"246\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"246\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The overall growth in revenue for the company came from a rise in the number of locations that it has in operation, from 3,615 last year to 3,916 this year. There was also a slight increase in comparable store sales, amounting to 0.3%. But that's far worse than the 6% increase that the company saw in the same quarter last year on a year-over-year basis. What was really problematic is the fact that the comparable store sales for the company were driven entirely by higher prices, with the average check rising by 1.1%. At the same time as this, the number of transactions dropped by 0.8%.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2136\" data-height=\"878\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"263\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"263\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580227745142_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am not a big believer in the value of anecdotes. But the second investment book that I ever read was One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch. In that book, I became fascinated by the fact that he would often physically check in on the companies that he was considering buying to get a full understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the business in person. Keeping in mind that a single visit to a single location does not offer significant value if our goal is to get an understanding of the health of the business as a whole, I would like to mention that just a month ago, I visited one of the Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants near my home. I am a big fan of its food, and I consider myself a foodie. I was shocked when, probably around 1:00 PM, I walked in and was the only customer for the business to service. The number of employees seemed low, and honestly, the food was not as fresh as it should have been. It was a rather disappointing experience for a chain that has a history of lines going to or even exiting out of its doors.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2060\" data-height=\"882\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Margins\" width=\"640\" height=\"274\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"274\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618580499595048_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I should have used that experience to buy some put options on the stock, but I didn't. However, I doubt that this is so much a company-specific issue as it is a consumer issue. Management continues to focus on innovations, including those involving its menu and investing in digital orders. In fact, the firm went from generating 34% of its food and beverage sales through digital means in the third quarter of last year to generating 36.7% of them at the same time this year. I think the bigger problem is precisely what management hit on, which is that consumer headwinds and macroeconomic challenges remain a problem.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1518\" data-height=\"1008\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Confidence\" width=\"640\" height=\"425\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"425\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Federal Reserve</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's be honest: when it comes to food, Chipotle Mexican Grill is not the go-to place if your goal is to maintain a strict budget. It's the place that you go to if you want food that is of a higher quality and don't mind paying a little bit more than what fast food joints would charge you. During difficult times, I would imagine that Chipotle Mexican Grill would struggle. As I have detailed in other articles, like <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829256-trump-100-percent-tariff-on-china-may-cause-economy-to-spiral-toward-recession\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829256-trump-100-percent-tariff-on-china-may-cause-economy-to-spiral-toward-recession\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4808493-a-recession-is-coming-are-you-prepared\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4808493-a-recession-is-coming-are-you-prepared\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, the U.S. economy seems to be heading toward a recession. Jobs data is getting worse almost by the month. And with tariffs now at play, there is a real risk of economic contraction in the near future. I have been arguing this since August. It is the first time in my professional career that I have ever said a recession is practically guaranteed. Even consumer confidence is near an all-time low, as the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UMCSENT\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UMCSENT\" target=\"_blank\">chart</a> above illustrates.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1948\" data-height=\"898\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Costs\" width=\"640\" height=\"295\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"295\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even though revenue for the company increased, the profitability worsened. Earnings per share did rise from $0.28 to $0.29. But that was only thanks to a change in share count. Overall net income grew from $387.4 million to $382.1 million. In the chart above, you can see important costs in relation to overall revenue. The good news is that food, beverage, and packaging expenses have actually gotten a bit better for the company. But other costs are on the rise, including labor expenses and occupancy costs. The big problem, however, seems to be its <span>\"</span>other operating costs,\" which rose from 13.83% of sales to 15%. Management blamed this on increased marketing and promotional activities and lower sales volumes. Fortunately, as the first chart in this article illustrates, cash flow metrics for the business at least improved.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2266\" data-height=\"852\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"241\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"241\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the chart above, you can see financial results for the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same time last year. In this case, results did improve across the board. But overall, the company remains challenged. So far, comparable restaurant sales this year are down 1.4%, even though the company benefited to the tune of 1.3% from higher prices. But again, consumer confidence is incredibly weak right now, and even small price increases can have an impact on traffic. In fact, the number of transactions that the company saw was down 2.7% year over year. Until economic conditions improve or until management can do something to draw more customers into its doors, such as effective promotions, menu cost reductions, or new and innovative offerings at its restaurants, I expect worsening economic conditions to lead to more of this pain as time goes on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management has even had to reduce guidance for this year. Earlier in the year, they anticipated that overall comparable restaurant sales would be mostly flat. But now they expect them to be down at a low single-digit rate. Despite this, the company is pushing forward with its growth plans. It still intends to open between 315 and 345 locations this year, with 80% of those boasting a Chipotlane. According to some <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/chipotle-starbucks-mcdonalds-quick-restaurants-drive-throughs-3d7ac4f0\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/chipotle-starbucks-mcdonalds-quick-restaurants-drive-throughs-3d7ac4f0\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a>, a Chipotlane typically boosts overall restaurant sales by between 10% and 15%, also leading to greater margins and overall returns. So it is great to see investments being made in these.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next year, management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835032-chipotle-mexican-grill-inc-cmg-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835032-chipotle-mexican-grill-inc-cmg-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">intends</a> to push growth even further, opening between 350 and 370 locations.

If we project our results based on what we have seen already this year, we would expect net profits of $1.54 billion, adjusted operating cash flow of $2.14 billion, and EBITDA of $2.32 billion. Using these estimates, we can see in the chart above how shares of the company are currently valued. Relative to what the company was valued at using data from last year, shares are a bit cheaper. But not radically so. The stock is certainly cheaper than it was when I last wrote about it. And now, as you can tell by looking at the table below, it is priced around the middle of what other similar enterprises are priced at. Considering its growth trajectory and potential, and adding on top of this the fact that it has no debt and has $698.7 million of cash on its books, I think that there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><strong>Company</strong></td> <td><strong>Price/Earnings</strong></td> <td><strong>Price/Operating Cash Flow</strong></td> <td><strong>EV/EBITDA</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Chipotle Mexican Grill</strong></td> <td><strong>29.7</strong></td> <td><strong>21.3</strong></td> <td><strong>19.4</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Starbucks (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBUX\" title=\"Starbucks Corporation\">SBUX</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>36.2</strong></td> <td><strong>19.4</strong></td> <td><strong>21.8</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>The Cheesecake Factory (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAKE\" title=\"The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated\">CAKE</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>15.1</strong></td> <td><strong>7.8</strong></td> <td><strong>12.8</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Shake Shack (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHAK\" title=\"Shake Shack Inc.\">SHAK</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>196.0</strong></td> <td><strong>20.6</strong></td> <td><strong>23.7</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Dutch Bros.

This simply means that the management team has done a similar job as their peers. We can observe that until recently only VVR was the outperformer from this cohort. However, in the past year FRA has outperformed both VVR and JFR. We will explore shortly why, in the Premium/Discount section.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Premium/Discount to NAV</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FRA has outperformed its peers this year, not due to outstanding management decisions, but the market perception of its peers:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">JFR and VVR seem to have a bigger retail investor base, base which started pricing in lower Fed Funds and the changing macro environment. FRA has lagged in doing so, with the CEF still at an astounding premium to NAV of 2.3%. We are of the opinion this state of affairs will change, with the CEF set to move to a discount as the market prices correctly the current macro.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since historically FRA does not show any alpha to its peers, it is set to being valued similarly, i.e. at a discount. We shall show you the macro drivers responsible for this.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Macro drivers: lower fed funds and tight spreads</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Leveraged loans are floating rate, meaning they pay SOFR plus a spread. As Fed Funds move lower, SOFR moves lower, hence the all-in yield paid by leveraged loans decreases. What does this mean? It means in such an environment investors tend to move away from floating rate assets into fixed rate assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On October 29, 2025 the Fed <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/10/30/fed-cuts-key-rate-yet-powell-says-future-reductions-are-not-locked-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">cut</a> rates yet again, bringing the effective Fed Funds target rate to 3.75%-4%:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors can debate where the neutral rate lies, but one thing is certain: rates are moving lower. Is the neutral rate 3% or is it 2%? One can debate this for a while, but at the end of the day SOFR is headed lower, and all-in yields for leveraged loans are headed lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second macro headwind for leveraged loans is made up of tight credit spreads. We have compressed to a level in spreads that is at the bottom of a 10-year range. This simply means the market is very complacent, and during a risk-off event spreads are headed higher. Higher spreads means lower prices for leveraged loans, which means a lower NAV for a fund like FRA. While we do not have a crystal ball to predict the exact timing, it will eventually happen in the next 12 months. It is just a matter of time.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current dividend is unsustainable</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The CEF is currently paying a 11.88% distribution, but this level is unsustainable:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"646\" data-height=\"297\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"section\" width=\"640\" height=\"294\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Section 19a <span>(Company)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even before the most recent Fed action, the CEF was paying out an unsustained dividend. As we can see from its August 2025 Section 19a notice, the CEF was using 32% return of capital. This is a very large figure that will become larger as lower rates percolate down the holdings. Please note many leveraged loans are set off 3-months SOFR, meaning a lower Fed Funds level will take a few months to translate into a lower all-in yield. It is coming however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using the above 32% ROC figure gives us an actual cash supported distribution of below 9%. That level will be cemented by lower Fed Funds. Math points towards a cut in the distribution rate to make it more sustainable. We see the fund moving to a 9% or 10% distribution rate in the next few months, thus still using ROC but a lower amount of it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors hate distribution cuts, and we believe that is why we have not seen this yet happen, but the management team will not have a choice.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FRA is a leveraged loan CEF. The name is negatively impacted by lower Fed Funds, and has an overhang in terms of tight credit spreads. Surprisingly the CEF is still trading at a premium to NAV while its peers are at discounts close to -10%. The fund's distribution is not supported, with the latest Fed cut suggesting a supported cash distribution closer to 9%. We are of the opinion that the CEF will end up cutting its distribution and moving to a discount to NAV, thus putting pressure on its price.</p>",

This reexamination of the stock will concentrate on the top 2 in my assessment: the release of its Panther Lake chips in early October and also the release of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4507834-intel-non-gaap-eps-of-0_23-beats-by-0_22-revenue-of-13_7b-beats-by-560m\">FQ3 earnings report</a> (\"ER\"). In the remainder of this article, I will explain why these developments keep generating conflicting signals and clouding the stockâs return/risk profile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me start with the positives. The release of its Panther Lake (see the photo below showing Intel CEO <a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/client-computing/intel-unveils-panther-lake-architecture-first-ai-pc-platform-built-on-18a#:~:text=Intel%20Unveils%20Panther%20Lake%20Architecture,%28credit:%20intel%20corporation%29.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lip-Bu Tan</a> holding one of the wafters) marks the first client SoCs built on Intelâs 18A technology. The release was quickly reviewed by many other analysts. Thus, here I will only focus on an aspect â a crucial aspect in my view - that received little attention: the power efficiency boost. Compared to previous generations, 18A can reduce power consumption by up to 40% at the same performance level as detailed in the following CRN analysis:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em><a href=\"https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/2025/intel-shares-details-of-forthcoming-intel-18a-chips-crucial-to-its-comeback\" rel=\"nofollow\">CRN news (Oct 9, 2025):</a> The company also boasted of Panther Lake featuring greater than 40 percent more NPU TOPS per area than Lunar Lake, whose NPU maxed out to 48 TOPS. In addition, Intel said that Panther Lake will require more than 30 percent less power than the Core Ultra Series 2 desktop chips formerly known as Arrow Lake to provide a similar level of multi-threaded CPU performance. At a system-on-chip level, Panther Lake will use up to 10 percent lower power than Lunar Lake and as much as 40 percent less power than Arrow Lake.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next, I will detail the implications of such power efficiency boost and explain why it could potentially help to expand the adoption of INTCâs 18A for AI applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"851\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"A person holding a circular object in front of a sign AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"454\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181216491_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Intel</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI cost structure</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among all the roadblocks (technological, legal, ethical, et al.) behind AI applications, power consumption is a crucial one, yet less often discussed issue, in my view. AI power demand has been rising rapidly in recent years, and is projected to keep growing in the years to come. For example, the following forecast from DNV projects a tenfold increase in AI power consumption in the next 5~6 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1174\" data-height=\"844\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph of data on a white background AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"460\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181230558_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DNV forecast</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The economic, social, and environmental implications of meeting such an enormous power demand is as important as the AI technology itself in my mind. Since this is an investing analysis, I will refrain myself from rumbling and only focus on the economic aspect. Such a power demand directly translates into an outsized electricity bill for end AI users. To obtain a back-of-envelop estimate, I gleaned the following parameters from a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/craigsmith/2023/09/08/what-large-models-cost-you--there-is-no-free-ai-lunch/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forbes report</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p></p> <ul> <li><em>The cost of the chips amounted to millions of dollars. According to a technical overview of OpenAIâs GPT-3 language model, each training run required at least <strong>$5 million worth</strong> of GPUs.</em></li> <li><em>These models require many, many training runs as they are developed and tuned, so the final cost is far in excess of this figure. When asked at an MIT event in July whether the cost of training foundation models was on the order of <strong>$50 million to $100 million,</strong> OpenAIâs cofounder Sam Altman answered that it was âmore than thatâ and is getting more expensive.</em></li> <li><em>The cost doesnât end there. Running inference on the models, once trained, is also expensive. Estimates suggest that in January 2023, ChatGPT used nearly 30,000 GPUs to handle hundreds of millions of daily user requests. Sajjad Moazeni, a University of Washington assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering, says those queries may <strong>consume around 1 GWh each day.</strong></em></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming an electricity price of ~$0.14 per kWh (FYI - electricity costs range from about $0.12 to $0.17 per kWh depending on where you are in the U.S.), 1 GWh of power consumption means an electricity cost of $140,000 PER DAY. This in turn means $51 million per year â more than 10x of the AI chipsâ upfront costs. A technology that can save up to 40% of energy use thus means an energy saving of tens of millions of dollars per year for AI developers and end users. Such significant reduction in electricity consumption and electricity cost could provide a strong competitive edge for the Panther Lake and other chips based on the 18A among for deployment in large-scale AI data centers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">INTC stock: near-term issues</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, switching to the near-term developments and risks. The company reported its FQ3 ER on Oct 23 As you can see from the following chart below. Overall, INTC delivered a strong quarter with both top and bottom lines beating consensus. The company has already raised its FQ4 outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I see quite a few risks lurking beneath the good news. Here, I will focus on the top 3 in my mind: margin uncertainty, its foundry business, and also valuation. Based on the updates provided in the ER, I am concerned about a margin squeeze ahead. Judging by the ER, I expect INTCâs 10/7 nodes to be short supplied at least into FQ1 of 2026. For readers unfamiliar with the technical details, there older nodes are the more profitable and highly demanded ones. In the meantime, I donât expect the new 18A node to reach peak capacity anytime soon (my estimate is that the 18A ramp up will last till 2030.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For its foundry business, I donât see a material improvement from the ER. I keep seeing slow internal adoption (e.g., for the 18A node) and also lack of large external customers given the competition in this space (e.g., vs. TSM as detailed in my earlier article). Yet, the rally of its share prices seems to have already factored in a large improvement in its external foundry revenue, as detailed next.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1898\" data-height=\"335\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A screenshot of a computer screen AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"113\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-17618301812829046_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other risks and final thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, Intel trades at a significantly higher P/E ratio than both foundry peers (such as TSM) and chip peers (such as AMD). INTC's forward P/E for the fiscal year 2026 (FY1) is 122x, which is over four times TSM's P/E of ~30x and nearly double AMD's P/E of 67x. With INTCâs current market capitalization (MC) of about $197 billion as of this writing, its MC would be about $108 billion only if it were to trade at the same FY1 P/E as AMD, a pure chip player.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, I believe it is reasonable to assume that the market is giving its foundry business a valuation of around $90 billion. This is a quite aggressive assumption in my view for many reasons. First, I donât believe INTCâs chip business is worth the same P/E multiple as AMDâs given the technological gap. Second, a valuation of around $90 billion is also difficult to justify for its foundry business. As a reference point, TSM, a pure foundry player, is valued at ~30x FY1 P/E and about 10x P/sales ratio as seen. Even at TSMâs ~10x P/sales and ~30x P/E ratios, a valuation of around $90 billion implies external sales of around $9 billion per years and net profit of around $3 billion per year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am skeptical whether INTCâs foundry business can sustainably generate this level of revenue and/or profit in the foreseeable future. The company continued reporting an operating loss (of around $2.3 billion) in the FQ3 ER.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To recap, this revisit to INTC was mainly triggered by 2 new developments: its 18A update and FQ3 ER. These developments keep generating conflicting signals. I see substantial potential for the 18A to help with the companyâs market share in the crucially important AI space, both due to its computing performance and also power efficiencies. However, near-term dynamics remain challenging due to issues like margin uncertainty, 18A ramp up, and foundry costs. The current valuation risk is also elevated, which is based on assumptions to aggressive to justify in my model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1162\" data-height=\"282\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A screenshot of a white background AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"155\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48844541-1761830181187992_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

As such, I think AWS's growth rate climbing above the 20% y/y mark is a massively positive development. And, with Amazon's $11B Project Rainier AI supercomputer <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/aws/aws-project-rainier-ai-trainium-chips-compute-cluster\" rel=\"nofollow\">going live yesterday</a> with more than 500K Trainium2 custom AI chips (plus, more AI infrastructure coming online in the near future), the momentum at AWS should continue in the upcoming quarters.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p><em>We continue to see strong momentum and growth across Amazon as AI drives meaningful improvements in every corner of our business. AWS is growing at a pace we havenât seen since 2022, reaccelerating to 20.2% YoY. We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and weâve been focused on accelerating capacity â adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months. </em></p> <p>- Andy Jassy, Amazon's CEO.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I see it, Amazon handily exceeded raised analyst expectations for Q3 2025, with its twin growth engine of AWS and Ads humming along beautifully. And as long as the macroeconomic resilience persists, Amazon's business momentum is likely to remain strong for the foreseeable future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon Fair Value And Expected Return</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering Amazon's stronger-than-expected Q3 2025 report and forward guidance, I am lifting our model's revenue base to $717B (updated FY2025E revenue) for today's valuation exercise.

If the interest rates were to return to artificially low levels (i.e., ZIRP), higher equity multiples would be justifiable. However, I work with the assumption that interest rates will eventually track the long-term average of ~5%. Inverting this number, we get a trading multiple of ~20x (P/FCF).</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming a base case exit multiple of 20x P/FCF, we reach a 5-year price target of ~$459 per share for AMZN, which implies a CAGR return of ~13.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51572009-1761860176869001_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"763\" data-height=\"367\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51572009-1761860176869001_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon stock\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"308\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51572009-1761860176869001_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51572009-1761860176869001_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51572009-1761860176869001_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51572009-1761860176869001_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51572009-1761860176869001_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51572009-1761860176869001_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51572009-1761860176869001_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51572009-1761860176869001_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">TQI Valuation Model <span>(Free to use at TQIG.org)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of Q3 2025, Amazon's business is in fine fettle, with AWS and Ads in acceleration mode. Now, while I am impressed with Amazon's Q3 business performance, the quick jump in its stock price from ~$215 per share to ~$250 per share has rendered AMZN stock a Hold under our valuation process. This is because its updated 5-year expected CAGR return of ~13% is lower than TQI's investment hurdle rate of 15%. Henceforth, at TQI, we will be pausing the accumulation of Amazon stock for now, and wait for a better entry point that could arrive via time and/or price correction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, valuation agnostic investors and/or those seeking a low volatility, high-quality tech stock can continue to accumulate AMZN stock here in the mid-$200s with a long-term 3-5+ year investment horizon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> I now rate Amazon stock a \"Hold\" in the mid-$200s.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thank you for reading, and happy investing!

Revenue was up 85% from last year, but all year-over-year comparisons are heavily distorted by its acquisition of the First of Long Island. Q3 represents the first full quarter of FLIC being a part of CNOB. Adjusted earnings excluded $0.08 of favorable one-time items, namely a $6.6 million benefit from an employee retention tax credit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bankâs return on tangible equity accelerated nicely to 12.6% from 9.3% last quarter and 7% a year ago. A key driver of the FLIC purchase was to improve CNOBâs funding mix and enhance scale in order to drive better returns for investors. I view it as essential for a bank to earn an ROE of at least 10% to show it is meeting its cost of capital. In Q3, CNOB achieved this. We will need to see this sustained, and that in turn can help support a valuation more clearly in excess of book value. I believe it will be sustained.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance sheet mix is better post-FLIC</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Turning to its balance sheet, client deposits rose by about 1% sequentially and sit at $11.4 billion, up from $7.8 billion last year. While total deposits are up about 45%, noninterest-bearing balances are up over 75% to $2.5 billion. They now account for over 20% of deposits. This is not an unusually high share; rather, legacy CNOB had relatively low NIB balances. These balances are especially valuable in an elevated interest rate environment, and their presence on the balance sheet is helping to improve margins. Interest-bearing deposit costs declined to 3.31%, down 4bps sequentially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Loans grew by about 1.2% from Q2 to $11.3 billion. This, of course, was up dramatically from last yearâs $8.3 billion, given the FLIC purchase. CNOBâs loan portfolio is heavily geared towards commercial real estate (âCREâ). It has $7.6 billion of CRE loans and another $700 million of construction loans. As CRE came under pressure, this exposure has been a source of concern. However, CRE appears less problematic in generalânot to mention the fact that CNOBâs own underwriting has proven to be strong, as evidenced by improving credit quality (more on that below).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In particular, while the office still clearly has challenges, we are seeing employers pivot away from remote work, which is a positive for office demand, all else equal. Plus, as interest rates have come off their highs, we have seen capital market access improve, allowing more buildings to refinance and term out their debt, an additional positive. Instead, it appears that there may be more problems in private credit and corporate lending, as seen by headlines of losses over the past month. CNOBâs local and CRE-oriented loan book is much more immune to this pressure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, FLICâs balance sheet had a higher share of investment securities, so the company now has $1.25 billion of securities, from $646 million last year. Its investment portfolio yields 4.27%, up 31bps from Q2, given a full quarter impact of FLIC. I expect this to be at or near the peak in yields on this portfolio. Over time, I expect the investment portfolio to become a smaller share of total assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CNOBâs net interest margin (âNIMâ) expanded by 5bps sequentially to 3.11%. Importantly, it ended the quarter even stronger at 3.20%, despite a rate cut in September. This creates a very positive launching point for Q4, which should drive incremental net interest income next quarter. NIM was up 44bps from last year, primarily due to a 70bp drop in deposit costs, speaking to the benefit of FLICâs low-cost deposit base and higher share of NIBs. In Q3, net interest income was $103 million, up 29% sequentially, primarily due to a full quarter of FLIC assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect 3-5% NII growth in Q4, given the NIM improvement we are still seeing. The company still has excess liquidity on its balance sheet as it normalizes its balance sheet post-acquisition. As it deploys this liquidity into loans and other assets, or paying off higher-cost liabilities, we should see NIM continue to improve. CNOB is maintaining a ~99% loan-to-deposit ratio for a second quarter, and I expect it to continue running right around 100%, meaning that loan and deposit growth should broadly track each other going forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Credit quality impresses</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Turning to credit quality, during the quarter, ConnectOne took 20bps of net charge-offs. Nonperforming assets are just 28bps, nearly half of the 53bps at the start of the year. The company has $40 million of nonperforming assets, which is actually down $17 million since the start of the year, even with the addition of FLICâs loans. That is because the bank has been able to work out 3 CRE loans that had fallen to nonaccrual status.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the quarter, provisions were $5.5 million. Last quarter, it set aside $36 million, but this included $27.4 million as an initial provision against FLICâs loans. Normalizing for this, Q2 provisions were ~$8 million, so we saw a meaningful sequential improvement here. It has $156 million of reserves for credit losses, providing about 395% coverage of nonaccrual loans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Particularly in an asset-backed loan portfolio like CNOBâs, I view coverage of 250% or higher as excellent. With the level of reserves that CNOB is carrying, it is already prepared for a meaningful deterioration in credit quality. In other words, NPAs could rise materially before it has to set aside more reserves. Given I do not expect a recession or material worsening of credit quality, I expect provisions to remain low and see scope for gradual reserve releases over time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">With solid capital and improving returns, CNOB is attractive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, CNOB has a 10.2% common equity tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio, down from 11.1% last year, given the ownership of FLIC. This is a healthy level, and CNOB can safely run the bank at about 9.5% capital in my view. As such, it has sufficient capital to ensure its 3% dividend yield is secure, grow its asset base, and likely do some share repurchases next year out of retained earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in August, I was targeting $24.25, or about 1.1x tangible book value. The company ended the quarter with a $22.85 book value. Increasingly, as we are seeing the full benefits of FLICâs low-deposit base, I see scope for a 1.2x multiple (given a ~12% run-rate ROE). That could push shares towards $27. That can occur if we continue to see steady execution and no surprise in loans inherited from FLIC (which CNOB already does appear reserved for).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I view CNOB as having discrete idiosyncratic benefits thanks to its FLIC purchase and improved balance sheet composition, which make it attractive in the regional banking sector. As such, I am upgrading shares to buy as these tailwinds become more apparent with over 12% upside.</p>",

And I suggest that this valuation is unfair to the company and the telecommunications industry as a<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> whole. I will try to explain why below.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Future Needs T-Mobile</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I wonder why Wall Street rates telecommunications companies as boring value stocks and fails to see their potential. I see the potential. And in my view, it is huge. When AI development **reaches** the mass consumers, who will supply the connection for the <a href=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/mobility-report/articles/genai-impact-on-mobile-network-traffic\" rel=\"nofollow\">increased traffic</a>?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The answer is simple: it will be cellular operators and providers. Artificial intelligence is very demanding in terms of memory and traffic. That means that when it reaches the mass consumer market, people will need very good mobile communications. And lots of gigabytes and terabytes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When the robots will walk the streets, or a lot of cars with different AI or autopilot features will be around. And the Internet of Things will grow, they'll probably need a SIM card and internet access. And this as I think may result in the fact that in America in 5 or 10 years, with a population of, for example, 350 million people, there will be 1 billion mobile subscribers. And most of them will be non-human.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This perspective creates a multiple growth potential for mobile operators in the future. In this case, telecommunications companies' shares will be clear growth stocks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Reliability</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am quite surprised by T-Mobile's P/E ratio of 20, which is significantly lower than the market average, because this indicator is unfair to a company that reliably generates revenue, even without the prospects I described above.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">T-Mobile and the whole network operator industry in my mind is very reliable. Just ask yourself: If tomorrow there will be a crisis like in 2008 or other crisis. Will you save on your communication? I am sure that for 90% or more of people nowadays, cellular communication and smartphones have become a necessity. And people will save on communication as a last resort.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It means that mobile operators are reliable companies. Yes, they are competing with each other. And yes, they are taking market share from each other. But in general, people who spend a huge amount of time on their phones these days will not give up their connection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mobile communications is the final mile to the consumer. The AI boom, yearly growth in computing power, and other stuff mean that communications are needed and it will have steady and reliable demand. However, the wave of growth sparked by AI just hasn't hit this industry yet. But I'm sure it will sooner or later.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Financial Profile</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now let's talk about finances. We start with some background information. Ten years ago, the company ranked third among mobile operators in the US, behind AT&amp;T and Verizon. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merger_of_Sprint_Corporation_and_T-Mobile_US\" rel=\"nofollow\">But they bought Sprint</a>, the fourth-largest operator, and jumped to the top.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This deal was closed in 2020. And this deal affected the company's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TMUS\">financial performance</a>, which you can see in the table below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1548\" data-height=\"384\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"princescreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"159\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571272845_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">T-Mobile financial indicators <span>(SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Total revenue grew from $44 billion in 2019 to $80 billion in 2021. Gross profit grew just as strongly as revenue. However, the company's net profit did not grow immediately after revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was the expected <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-rates-t-mobile-secured-notes-bbb-01-12-2021\" rel=\"nofollow\">effect of the integration</a>. Merging two giant networks, IT systems, teams, and customer bases required huge costs. T-Mobile incurred significant expenses for dismantling Sprint's obsolete equipment, upgrading sites, integrating billing, optimizing staffing, etc. In addition, according to accounting rules, the company began to depreciate (write off) the cost of Sprint's acquired assets by billions of dollars, which also âate intoâ net income. Although it was not a direct cash expense. That's why I think that the low profit level of $3 billion was unnatural and temporary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So the company got through this costly period, which is confirmed by its profit growth in 2023-2025. And I think that, given the circumstances I've described, the company's current profit level can be considered stable for the combined company. That's why this basis for the P/E ratio is valid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now let's talk about the company's <a href=\"https://bullfincher.io/companies/t-mobile-us/revenue-by-segment\" rel=\"nofollow\">revenue structure</a>, which you can see in the following table with data for 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w640\" alt=\"self-made\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"466\" height=\"351\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-17615045711237159.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">T-Mobile US's revenue by segment <span>(bullfincher)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More than 81% of revenue comes from providing communication services. And as I wrote above, I don't think that people will cut back on these expenses. Therefore, I find this part of the revenue very reliable. As for the rest, which includes the sale of phones and other items that can be called ancillary businesses, their proportion is not high enough to pose a significant risk to the company's financial stability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Expansion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think it's very important to say that T-Mobile bought Sprint not only because of its millions of subscribers and economies of scale. The key factor was also that Sprint had an extensive portfolio of radio frequencies, <a href=\"https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/mobility-report/articles/t-mobile-5g-spectrum\" rel=\"nofollow\">especially in the 2.5 GHz mid-band range</a>. This frequency range is the sweet spot for 5G, offering the ideal balance between wide coverage and high bandwidth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By getting these frequencies, T-Mobile was able to quickly roll out its 5G Ultra Capacity network, which was years ahead of similar networks from competitors. Verizon and AT&amp;T finally had to spend time and billions of dollars at C-Band auctions to get similar frequency spectrum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is why T-Mobile has not only successfully integrated Sprint subscribers in recent years, but also offered the market the best 5G speeds, attracting new customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After merging with Sprint, T-Mobile showed high growth rates in its customer base, actively taking customers away from Verizon and AT&amp;T due to successful price positioning and rapid deployment of its 5G network. As a result, the company's shares rose significantly in the period 2023-24.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But in the first half of 2025, investors saw the first signals of a slowdown in subscriber growth. This caused worry among some investorsâ whether T-Mobile had exhausted its potential for expansion. Especially since competitors by this time had narrowed the gap in deploying 5G networks. This and the general market correction in the spring of this year led to a lower share price for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the data for the past quarter released on October 23 is very promising. Customer base growth has accelerated, as you can see in the table below with quarterly breakdowns of indicators.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Selfmade\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"581\" height=\"201\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571119536.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">T-Mobile quarterly financial performance <span>(SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see from the table, the financial indicators show overall stability. Yes, there are some minor quarterly fluctuations in revenue and net income. For example, the reduction in net income in Q3 2025 may be due to a one-time factor or investments, but they are not critical in the overall picture. The company generates more than $20 billion in revenue per quarter and billions of dollars in profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, T-Mobile's position as a market leader <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/news/business-wire/20251022720694/t-mobile-delivers-record-customer-growth-fueled-by-widening-differentiation-and-focus-on-durable-and-profitable-financial-growth-raises-guidance-across-the-board\" rel=\"nofollow\">with 139,9 million customers</a> giving it an advantage of scale. This makes it possible to invest more effectively in the network, providing better coverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For me, the third quarter report confirms the company's leading position in the market. The company continues to move forward. But that's all the details of the current moment; its biggest opportunities are still ahead.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Looking to the Future</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, investors are focusing on tech giants as pioneers in AI development, and on data center equipment manufacturers. People expect that in the future, AI will enter into every home, changing our lives and create new markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But I would say this. People see that AI needs infrastructure for its âbrain,â but they forget that this brain needs infrastructure for the nerves that connect it to the consumer. Without powerful, fast, and ubiquitous connectivity, the whole AI revolution will get stuck in data centers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that when AI reaches the mass consumer through AI assistants in smartphones, smart cars, AR/VR headsets, and robot assistants, the requirements for communication networks will dramatically change.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the evolution of AI, as I wrote above, there will surely be a whole army of new cellular subscribers in the form of machines. Smart cars, drones, industrial robots, simple robots, and many other things will need to connect to the internet. And I guess traffic will increase too, because all this will require a huge flow of information.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Telecom operators such as T-Mobile in that situation will be the beneficiaries of AI development. But I'll clarify that this will happen later. It's not happening just now, we don't see strong growth in the financial indicators of mobile operators yet. And my idea cannot be confirmed by figures. It is based on simple logic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI, as I understand it, has not yet reached the mass consumer in sufficient volume to transform the telecommunications market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I wrote in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4825279-why-i-believe-the-market-rally-is-losing-steam\">my article on the overall market situation</a>, if we exclude high-tech companies from the calculation, the rest of the economy is stagnating. High interest rates on lending are suppressing investment activity, and consumer demand is weak.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But sooner or later, the economy as a whole, not just the AI industry, will grow. The Fed's interest rates will be lower, which will allow a new credit cycle to begin. And then, I think we will see the realization of the idea I have described here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In recent years, T-Mobile has proven itself to be a strong and growing player in a relatively sluggish telecommunications market. It has become the leader in this market, essentially winning the competitive race. And this state of affairs, in my opinion, gives the company every chance of leading the industry's growth in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">T-Mobile's current valuation reflects only its current business, in an industry that the market values lower than the market average. But the market does not include the enormous growth potential that will inevitably come with the widespread adoption of AI. I expect the telecom sector to experience an AI boom in the future. And T-Mobile is the best way to bet on that future while the market has not yet recognized its value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a market capitalization of $243 billion, T-Mobile has a P/E ratio of only 20. If the share is valued not as a value stock but as a growth stock, the premium to the price will be tens of percent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am sure that in the long term, the company's shares will rise significantly in price. But for the moment, I will give a cautious recommendation to Buy. I will refrain from recommending a âStrong Buyâ because my thesis is based on a logic and forecast of future developments, rather than on past events reflected in the figures. And I see macroeconomic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzMJaTeOkH4\" rel=\"nofollow\">and political risks</a> for the market in the next six months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we look at the company's chart, I would strongly recommend buying the company's shares if they reach the support level marked on the chart below. This could happen if the US market as a whole turns negative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1409\" data-height=\"542\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Print screen\" width=\"640\" height=\"246\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/26/61455731-1761504571229754_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">T Mobile chart <span>(SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But somehow, either with support or without it, the stock will move up and rise significantly in price in the coming years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I do think that any dip in T-Mobile stock caused by short-term market or macroeconomic factors should be used to buy or add to positions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, I'd like to point out that it's possible that the market will see the potential ahead of time, and then the shares could start growing from any level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect that T-Mobile and the whole telecom sector are on the verge of a major transformationâfrom âboringâ value companies to growth companies of the new digital era.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Key Risks</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main risk, as you might guess, is the situation in the US market as a whole due to politics and macroeconomics. If a correction is ahead for the S&amp;P 500 index, T-Mobile shares will not be able to ignore it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And the key risk is timing. My investment thesis is based on the expectation that the industry will be transformed by AI. But I can't say for sure when exactly this turning point will come.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, there are other, more traditional risks, such as increased competition or unfavorable regulatory changes, among others. But based on my main thesis, I think these factors are less critical.</p>",

While the fund has done well<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> relative to broader equity indexes, the bar is set very high for growth funds. The following sections will break down FFLGâs holdings and compare the fundâs valuation, performance, volatility, and tradability aspects with the Russell 1000 and other growth funds.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">ETF Description &amp; Highlights</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLG seeks long-term capital appreciation through exposure to companies that Fidelity identifies as exhibiting higher revenue and earnings growth potential than the broader equity market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fundâs investment process is based on the fundamental analysis of companies with similar market capitalization to the S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 indexes, taking into consideration elements such as financial health, earnings outlook, companiesâ strategy and management, along with their position in the related industry and economic outlook. A quantitative process is then applied to build the fundâs portfolio, following a high-conviction approach, while maintaining risk at appropriate levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of October 27, 2025, FFLG had $526 million in assets under management, invested across 90 holdings, with an average market cap of $739 billion, more than double that of the Russell 1000 index, represented here by the iShares Russell 1000 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWB\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 ETF\">IWB</a>). The fundâs larger capitalization tilt is clear, with mega caps accounting for 67.9% of total assets, while this category makes up only 43.2% of the benchmark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLGâs top ten holdings highlight its oversized allocation to big techs. NVIDIA (15.68%), Microsoft (9.54%), and Apple (8.66%) are the largest positions, while Amazon (6.38%), Meta Platforms (5.14%), Alphabet Class A (4.30%), and Class C (2.33%) are also overweight compared to equity market benchmarks. Broadcom (3.60%) and Taiwan Semiconductor (2.40%) reinforce the fundâs bet on the semiconductor industry, while Netflix (2.20%) is another key internet platform player.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"395\" height=\"306\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544370026526.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The following table presents a mix of large-cap growth funds, with the last three also relying on companiesâ fundamentals in the selection process. These funds will serve as the peer group for FFLG in this analysis. The first is the Vanguard Growth ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VUG\" title=\"Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF Shares\">VUG</a>), the largest in this group, which tracks a market-cap-weighted index. Next, iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWF\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF\">IWF</a>) follows a similar capitalization-weighted process, selecting companies from the Russell 1000 with higher forecasted earnings growth. Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHG\" title=\"Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETFâ¢\">SCHG</a>) tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Large Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index, also using a market-cap weighting system.

Far below are communication services at 17.8% and consumer discretionary at 12.2%. Smaller allocations include healthcare (6.8%) and industrials (5.7%), while financial services stand at a modest 5.0%, offering some cyclical exposure. Meanwhile, sectors such as consumer staples, basic materials, utilities, and real estate each remain below 1.5% of total assets, while energy holds only 0.1%. As a result, FFLG is overweight in technology (+14.2%) and communication services (+7.6%), while maintaining underweight positions in financial services (-8.0%), consumer staples (-3.7%), and energy (-2.8%), reflecting its limited exposure to traditional value areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Breaking down the fundâs positions across the largest sectors, we see that in technology, there are just 11 holdings, despite its large stance in the sector. Semiconductors make up nearly half of the sector, with shares of NVIDIA, Broadcom, and Marvell Technology. Software exposure includes Microsoft, Oracle, and Cadence, offering exposure to enterprise systems and chip design. Beyond that, Apple remains one of the fundâs largest positions as well, while smaller allocations in AppLovin, Nutanix, and Coherent add diversification to the fund in areas like app monetization, cloud infrastructure, and photonics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In communication services, FFLG owns a few companies, with large positions in Meta Platforms and Alphabet. The fund also holds positions in Roblox, a platform for interactive gaming and virtual creation, and Netflix, the well-known streaming provider.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positions in consumer discretionary, on the other hand, are more diversified, spread across 13 holdings. Digital retail is a core segment, with positions in Amazon, Carvana, and Wayfair. Traditional retail plays a role as well, with Loweâs and TJX providing exposure to home improvement and value-focused apparel, respectively. The fund also owns Tesla, representing the auto segment, and Starbucks, the global coffee retailer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside the FFLGâs three largest sectors, it still maintains exposure to a wide range of industries that add diversification to the fund. The most significant allocations include Howmet Aerospace, Axon Enterprise, and FTAI Aviation in aerospace and defense; Mastercard and Affirm in consumer finance; and several healthcare names, such as Boston Scientific, Eli Lilly, and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. Other minor positions include Apollo Global Management and Coinbase in capital markets, and GE Vernova in industrial conglomerates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"471\" height=\"434\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374672291.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLGâs large allocation to technology is in line with its typical growth peers like VUG, IWF, and SCHG, which also keep nearly half of the total assets in the sector. On the flip side, other more fundamentals-driven peers such as TMFC and FDG have a nearly 40% exposure to technology, which remains overweight compared to the Russell 1000âs 34.5% allocation. In turn, similar to FFLG, those fundamentally driven funds (FBCG, TMFC, and FDG) also have heavier positions in communication services in the 16% to 18% range, given the strong profitability and growth prospects of names like Meta Platforms and Alphabet. However, FFLG is underweight in sectors like consumer discretionary and financial services, reflecting more outsized positions of specific funds like FDG (19.7% in consumer discretionary) and TMFC (15.0% in financial services), rather than the whole peer groupâs upbeat consensus in these sectors. As a result, there is a very strong sector correlation among the whole peer group. FFLGâs correlation with most peers is 0.99, while it remains as high as 0.96 with TMFC and FDG.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"887\" data-height=\"417\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"301\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544373882053_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation In Line With The Peer Group Average</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At a 30.5x P/E, FFLG trades at a large 36% premium to the Russell 1000âs 22.4x. This is largely driven by the fundâs overweight allocation to technology, since the sectorâs average valuation is close to 36x P/E. But it is not the only reason. FFLGâs stock picking across sectors such as industrials, financial services, and healthcare also plays a role, as core holdings in these sectors, including Howmet Aerospace, Boston Scientific, and Mastercard, to name a few, all trade above 30x P/E.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund delivers on growth. Its historical earnings growth (22.2%) handily surpasses the Russell 1000 (7.4%), while its sales growth (11.1%) is also above the benchmark (7.4%). Earnings growth in the technology and consumer discretionary sectors is particularly higher than the benchmark, contributing to the fund's growth measures. However, the key factor remains its overweight exposure to these above-average growth areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, profitability indicators are more mixed. FFLGâs EBITDA margin (38.1%) is 2.1 percentage points higher than the Russell 1000 (36.0%), again due to its exposure to technology, as core holdings exhibit strong margins, such as NVIDIA (59.5%) and Microsoft (55.6%). Overweight positions in Meta Platforms (EBITDA margin 52.7%) and Mastercard (62.1%) help as well. On the other hand, FFLGâs ROE of 54.0% remains high, but lags the Russell 1000âs 59.2%, mainly due to negative ROE in holdings within healthcare (Alnylam: -5.0%), and communication (Roblox: -21.2%), which end up affecting the fundâs composite ROE.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar and ETFsâ websites, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"448\" height=\"369\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544372401102.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar and ETFsâ websites, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLG trades in the middle of the peersâ valuation range. Funds like VUG and IWF exhibit slightly higher valuations, driven by a larger exposure to technology. FDGâs valuation is the highest in the group, reflecting also higher allocation to consumer discretionary, while TMFC is the only one trading below 30x P/E, given its more measured stance in technology and consumer discretionary, along with an outsized allocation to financial services, a value sector by nature. Still, all funds trade well above the Russell 1000, which makes sense due to their much higher average earnings (22.8%) and sales growth (12.5%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"828\" data-height=\"241\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"186\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374036736_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outperforming The Russell 1000, But Lagging Most Peers</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With its inception in 2021, FFLG already has a track record of three years. During this period, it has delivered an uneven performance, with a steep decline in 2022, one of the worst among peers, offset by a strong rebound in 2023, the only year it has surpassed the peer group average. This is reflected in its 3-year annualized returns of 31.6%, the second worst among peers. Still, this is more than enough to make FFLG outperform broader equity indexes, such as the Russell 1000, which delivered 22.2% in the same time window.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLGâs volatility has been relatively high, with a 3-year beta of 1.26, which is high even for a growth fund standard, where the betaâs average is 1.15. This positions FFLG as the second-highest beta, only below FBCG (1.29). The fundâs capture ratio both to upside and downside at around 130 also highlights its historical tendency to amplify the broader market price action by a wide margin. For comparison, peers with a more conservative volatility profile (VUG, IWF, SCHG, and TMFC) have remained below 120.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"853\" data-height=\"460\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"345\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-17618544374286773_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLGâs average daily volume of $1.23 million is light compared to heavyweights like VUG, IWF, and SCHG, which trade hundreds of millions a day. Of course, FFLGâs bid-ask spread of 0.06% is wider than these very liquid funds, but remains in line with peers FBCG and TMFC. Its turnover of 52% is one of the highest in the group and is somewhat inconsistent with the fundâs claim of keeping a long-term investment perspective. This leads to an expense ratio of 0.38%, higher than market-cap-weighted funds (VUG, IWF, and SCHG), but still below other actively managed peers (FCG, TMFC, and FDG). The fund offers a low dividend yield of 0.19%, way below the broader market average of nearly 1%, though in line with peers, as all funds are below 0.5%. The fund tracking error, in the range of 8% to 9%, is above the average, while its Sharpe ratio of 1.33 (3-year) is the lowest among peers, along with FDG, as other peers have managed to deliver higher returns with more contained volatility. It is worth noting that FFLGâs Sharpe Ratio is still in line with the Russell 1000âs 1.32 (3-year), as a combination of the indexâs arguably strong gains and moderate volatility (beta of 1.02).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"776\" data-height=\"376\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar and Seeking Alpha, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"310\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49456258-176185443754289_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar and Seeking Alpha, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FFLGâs playbook is clear: a high-conviction fund with a portfolio that relies on mega caps to deliver growth. Its strong tilt toward technology is a consensus across growth funds, but it goes a step further through an overweight allocation to communication services. This sector mix and stock selection leave the fund trading at a premium to broad equity indexes, though in line with most peers, while a concentrated portfolio helps explain its above-average volatility. That said, there is no question that the fund has an aggressive profile. However, expectations for further interest rate cuts and generally positive Q3 earnings remain a positive setup for growth-oriented funds.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this context, FFLG is among the options to ride the expected continued strength in large-cap growth stocks. But, as we know, with stock market valuations at current levels and the likelihood of softer growth ahead, we should also acknowledge the risks of pullbacks along the way. And here is where FFLG seems not to be the best answer right now. Its high beta profile signals greater downside risk in a market that may see a bumpy ride going forward. Thus, I take a neutral view on this fund, as other growth peers are expected to offer a more balanced risk-reward ratio in this environment.</p>",
