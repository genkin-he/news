This was a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1250-bad-beat-investing/articles/5306339-what-is-going-on-with-my-silver-and-gold-mining-stocks\">long-term investing idea at BAD BEAT</a> Investing at a $1.35 basis. We have long<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> maintained a house position in this mid-tier silver name. Typically, we favor companies that can demonstrate organic growth without sacrificing the integrity of the balance sheet. For a long time this has been a challenge for the precious metal miners, we have to tell you. We saw stagnant prices outside of the slow grind higher in gold (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAUUSD:CUR\" title=\"Gold Spot Price\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">XAUUSD:CUR</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), silver (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAGUSD:CUR\" title=\"Silver Spot Price\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">XAGUSD:CUR</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), and base metals, with rising costs of production.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, folks, Endeavour Silver Corp. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXK\" title=\"Endeavour Silver Corp.\">EXK</a></span>) spent the last 24 months attempting to bridge the gap between being a high-cost legacy producer and a modern, multi-asset senior producer. Shares have absolutely skyrocketed on the back of the huge surge in metals prices. While the stock is expensive at first glance, when we consider. The <a href=\"https://edrsilver.com/site/assets/files/14787/edr_q4_2025_financial_results_tc_3_items.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">company’s Q4</a> and fiscal year 2025 results, released just this morning, confirm that the growth has arrived, but it has come with a hefty price tag.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, we are neutral on the name. We still hold it, and if prices stay elevated, it will translate to more earnings and justify the share price. Let us discuss.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Endeavour Silver Financial and Operating Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the market is cheering the 115% jump in revenue, we are taking a bit more measured approach as long-term shareholders. The transition from developer to a 15-million-ounce-equivalent producer is notoriously fraught with ramp-up costs and issues, and Endeavour’s Q4 numbers, in our opinion, certainly reflect a company that is currently larger, yet significantly more complex to manage. That all said, 2025 was, by any operational metric, a transformational period for Endeavour (and many other miners too). The company reported record revenue of $467.5 million, more than doubling the $217.6 million seen in 2024. This was driven by a 48% increase in silver equivalent (AgEq) production, which reached 11.2 million ounces.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Endeavour Silver Costs High, Earnings Light All Things Considered</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the bottom line tells a different story. Despite the massive run-up in prices, Endeavour still reported a net loss of $119.1 million for the year. Much of this, of course, was tied to $126.2 million in derivative revaluation losses and $14.5 million in finance charges related to debt restructuring. While these are largely non-cash or one-time items and get adjusted out, they do underscore the volatility inherent in Endeavour’s aggressive capital structure, so it was worth mentioning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, we mentioned costs above. That is more concerning. Specifically, it is the trend in All-In Sustaining Costs (AISC). For 2025, AISC landed at a staggering $31.52 per silver ounce, a 32% increase over the previous year. Even with realized silver prices averaging over $40/oz in 2025, the margin of safety is thinner than we would like to see for a company of this scale. Of course, silver is now much higher, but these are huge costs. Remarkably, the company only made $0.02 per share this quarter and lost $0.03 on the year. This again is all cost-related. Let's talk operations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Endeavour Silver Q4 2025 Operational Highlights</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The headline of Q4 in our mind was the successful declaration of commercial production at Terronera on October 1, 2025. In its first full quarter, the mine contributed 1.0 million AgEq ounces. While throughput was slightly ahead of schedule at 1,676 tpd, grades were lower than the life-of-mine average as the company focused on lower-grade zones during the initial ramp-up. We expect grades to normalize in the second half of 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At Guanaceví, the company’s bread-and-butter mine, for lack of a better analogy, recovered well from the 2024 trunnion failure, with throughput up 78% year-over-year. It remains the anchor of the portfolio, producing 3.9 million ounces of silver for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The newly acquired Kolpa mine in Peru is also beginning to contribute, adding significant base metal credits (lead and zinc) to the mix. However, the integration of a Peruvian asset into a historically Mexican-focused management team adds a layer of jurisdictional and operational risk that has yet to be fully de-risked. Meanwhile, the sale of the aging Bolañitos mine, expected to close this quarter, should help streamline management’s focus.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking Ahead on Endeavour Silver</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Endeavour’s 2026 guidance is ambitious, calling for 14.6 to 15.6 million AgEq ounces. This would represent another ~35% growth in output. One thing that we really like is that the company is trying to rein in its cost structure, guiding 2026 AISC down to the $27–$28 range. That would be welcomed. While this reduction is a step in the right direction, it still leaves Endeavour as one of the higher-cost producers in the silver sector. For comparison, peers with similar production profiles are targeting AISC in the low $20s. The capital-intensive nature of the Pitarrilla project and the ongoing inflationary pressures in Mexico suggest that meeting this $27 guidance is easier said than done.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Analyst <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXK/earnings/estimates\">consensus right</a> now is for $0.98 in adjusted EPS. That would mean just 14X roughly for what is some 6,000% growth. But the estimates are wide around this mark, ranging from $0.31 to $1.46. It will come down to those costs, and that is a big question mark. And should metal prices abate a bit more, the earnings power will be at the lower end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We do note that the company ended the year with a healthy <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXK/balance-sheet\">cash position</a> of $215.4 million, bolstered by a $350 million convertible note offering in December. Liquidity is not the issue here right now. Efficiency is what 2026 will be all about. What we see here is that the company has successfully built out its growth potential, and at large costs. We do think that the start-up of Terronera and the acquisition of Kolpa have fundamentally changed the company’s production profile.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, until the company can demonstrate that this increased scale leads to meaningful, repeatable net earnings, and we get AISC down meaningfully (ideally under $25), we find it hard to issue a buy rating. As such, we are hold rated. If we get two or three clean quarters of commercial production from Terronera and a reduction in costs, we will reevaluate our rating.</p>",

That's not a typo. Block is going from 10,000+ employees to under 6,000.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The core thesis is simple. Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company. We're already seeing it internally. A significantly smaller team, using the tools we're building, can do more and do it better.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875898-block-inc-xyz-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Earnings Call</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI tools allow a smaller team to build more, faster. That much we have already learned from the SaaSpocalypse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is responding to what it is seeing, which is:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>40%+ increase in code shipped per engineer</p></li> <li><p>Faster product velocity</p></li> <li><p>Leaner cost structure.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, Block has realized it can do the same with less, and that’s exactly what the company is doing, something the market has applauded.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you raise gross profit modestly but slash operating expenses, earnings explode. That’s exactly what the 2026 guide reflects: 54% Operating Income growth on 18% gross profit growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But underneath, this doesn't change the core issues that Block faces.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why I Would Sell</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This, in my view, is not how AI efficiency should work. I, in fact, discussed as much in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875518-did-nvidia-just-prove-citrini-wrong\">my recent rebuttal </a>of Citrini’s article.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI increases productivity. For companies that aren’t doing great, like Block, this is a lifeline that can help the company with a one-time productivity gain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the real winners of AI will be those who actually see the productivity gains and double down on them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A growing company should see that engineers are 40% more efficient and hire more engineers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But that’s not the case with Square.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a company with single-digit gross profit growth and guidance and core products that have failed to differentiate themselves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">How is Cash App better than Venmo?

The fall in reported revenue reflected currency movements and the impact of divestments, including the non-US Smokers’ Health business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, while the organic revenue growth was welcome, it was below the company’s own medium-term expectations. That was pinned primarily on a “weak” cold &amp; flu season (good for people, not so good for Haleon) and low consumer confidence in North America. I see both as ongoing risks that could affect revenue performance again in the coming year. However, for 2026, the firm guided for organic revenue growth of 3-5%. As a range that falls slightly below the medium-term target range of 4-6% annual organic revenue growth, although it still allows for the target to be met depending on where in the range actual performance ends up landing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it came to profitability, reported numbers grew 9% at the operating level and 18% for diluted earnings per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That strikes me as a very credible performance. This was put down to ongoing productivity improvements and disciplined investment. Disciplined investment can mean efficient spending, or it can mean cutting back on spending that does not show much in the short term, but then shows further down the line, so in years to come it will be worth keeping an eye on whether this so-called disciplined investment is hurting the brand equity of the company’s products, as premium branding is core to its business model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This year, as well as over the medium term, the company is targeting high-single-digit adjusted operating profit growth at constant currency. That strikes me as a fairly tough target on sluggish to modest revenue growth, so I’ll be keeping an eye on marketing spend and apparent effectiveness.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Broad-Based Performance Continues</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The flu season mentioned above ate into respiratory health revenues, while oral health grew strongly thanks in part to innovations such as Sensodyne’s Clinical platform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But overall the key takeaway was that there is no problem category for now, with most of them ticking over rather than performing strongly (oral health being the exception).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556480791843_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"995\" data-height=\"330\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556480791843_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Haleon 2025 preliminary results by category\" width=\"640\" height=\"212\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556480791843_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556480791843_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556480791843_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556480791843_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Company preliminary results announcement</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where I do see more grounds for concern is at the geographic segment level. EMEA and LatAm and APAC both delivered roughly 5% organic revenue growth, albeit in the former that came mostly from pricing, not volume or mix.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By contrast, North America’s 0.4% decline stands out.

But ongoing weakness in North America is a risk for 2026, as many U.S. consumers are clearly feeling the squeeze financially (in a supermarket in Miami recently, a friend asked me since when regular brand chips were sold for $6, $7, or $8 a packet, and while it’s a different and more discretionary product category than Haleon’s, the point stands more broadly I think: not only have prices shot up since 2020, but consumers notice it, feel it, and make decisions on the basis of it in many cases).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even more alarming in the U.S. is that Haleon said that, despite its revenue decline there last year, it grew slightly ahead of a declining market). Breaking down the North America performance, the two declining categories were respiratory health (which could be pinned on the flu season) and Vitamins, Minerals, and Supplements, which registered a low-single-digit decline. Centrum declined and then picked up in the second half, but in a tight economy, especially, branded supplements feel vulnerable to cheaper store labels, and I see this as a risk for 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Dividend Growth Story Remains Strong</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently Haleon yields 1.8%, which I regard as pretty unattractive in the London market right now, given the FTSE 100 is yielding around 3%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Haleon proposes to grow its full-year dividend by 7.6%. That is less than last year’s 10% but is still substantial.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is plenty of spare cash to fund ongoing dividend growth in future years (which I expect), with the company planning to expend £500m on share buybacks this year. Dividend costs of £612m were only 23% of net operating cash flows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, for the year, the net cash outflow was £855m. The company could have generated positive cash flow easily enough if it chose: £1.9bn was spent on debt repayment and share buybacks, so the cash outflow was significantly influenced by financing costs within the company’s control, not any structural issue with operating cash flows. Still, I think it’s worth keeping an eye on future cash flows, as over the medium to long term I’d expect a company like Haleon to be a sizeable free cash flow generator.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don’t think the communication on that point was done well at all: the results present what is described as “strong” free cash flow of £1.9bn, not noting that that is an adjusted figure. I’m baffled as to the source of this number, repeated throughout the results and in the CFO’s opening remarks on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874737-haleon-plc-hln-q4-2025-earnings-call-prepared-remarks-transcript\">earnings call</a>, as it does not tally with what I see as a net cash outflow (as described above), calculated by subtracting financing and investing cash flows from operating cash flows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556980197735_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1043\" data-height=\"1015\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556980197735_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Haleon cash flow statement 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"623\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556980197735_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556980197735_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556980197735_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17721556980197735_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Company preliminary results announcement</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">I Still Think Haleon is Fully Valued</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Share price growth since my last piece on the name outstripped the unadjusted earnings growth in last year’s results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That means the shares now trade at 21 times earnings.

It is, therefore, understandable that its deep undervaluation persists without momentum catalysts, like durable earnings growth. The volatility removes the appeal for long-term investors, potentially sparking marginal value rallies while consolidation and incremental downtrending remain the norm. These are the primary concerns I have and are the reason I initiated a short-term, 12-month trade, with an exit target of $4 per share, rather than a long-term investment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 Earnings Facts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Firstly, let's get a lay of the land with the objective data so that we can then analyze it without bias and according to our only logical objective: positive returns, and ideally alpha.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746838/000074683826000003/q42025earningsrelease.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q4 showed</a> operating leverage with revenue up by 5% year-over-year, with a non-GAAP operating margin at 18% versus 11.6% year-over-year. License and Support revenue, which is the primary high-margin engine, surged by 23% year-over-year. The Enterprise Computing Solutions segment also delivered a gross margin increase of 270 basis points, to 65.9%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 total contract volume was up by 53% year-over-year, and backlog reached $3.15B versus $2.84B year-over-year, supporting a near-term revenue floor and de-risking the investment somewhat, even if growth is soft. Labor savings also caused the Cloud, Applications, &amp; Infrastructure Solutions segment's gross margin to increase by 210 basis points year-over-year; if this is sustained, incremental margin could compound even on flat revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management also progressed with its pension de-risking trajectory, with the deficit down to about $0.45B, which is down about $0.3B overall. An annuity buyout removed about $320M in liabilities. If the cash drag from this continues to decrease, the equity multiple could lift. Pre-pension free cash flow was +$127.7M versus the official reported <a href=\"https://www.unisys.com/siteassets/investor-relations/earnings-files/2025/4q-2025-presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">free cash flow</a> of -$217.6M from the pension funding hit. The economic objective here is to reduce the pension overhang so free cash flow becomes less volatile, favoring shareholders.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 Earnings Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At this point, the investment looks pre-inflection from a structural standpoint. The company said that the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746838/000074683826000006/uis-20251231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q4 uplift</a> primarily came from the timing for License and Support renewals, and with licenses recognized at renewal, lumpiness is inherent in the business model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, management's own 2026 guide undercuts the \"durable spike\" narrative. The forecast is -6.5% to -4.5% on revenue, with FCF at roughly -$25M. Licensing and Support revenue is forecast at about $415M, below FY25's $428M. This means near-term uplift is capped, and sentiment inflection really hinges on FY27.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even with the backlog up on renewals, this doesn't fix near-term growth and scale economics even if it defends revenue. As such, we are left with likely consolidation and then the speculative prospect of organic growth occurring in FY27 to support a fair-value re-rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The major inflection that we do know about is from de-risking and deleveraging, with most \"excess\" pre-pension cash likely going to fund and service obligations. Pension cash needs from 2026 to 2029 are $352M plus high interest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FY25's Licensing &amp; Support renewal total contract value of $363M against $522M year-over-year is down by -30%. This is the highest-margin engine and clouds a strong Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ex-License and Support revenue was -1.4% in Q4, with the segment's gross margin down by 250 basis points. Digital Workplace Services gross margin was down by 540 basis points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, $700M 10.625% secure notes are due in 2031, somewhat reducing downside resilience; the company's equity-to-asset ratio is negative and has been for a long time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746838/000074683826000006/uis-20251231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">AI does appear</a> to be adding usage to the highest-margin stream (Licenses and Support), but management has warned of \"capability-to-advisory mismatch\" as AI evolves faster than the company's services can work to. AI might not be a near-term revenue catalyst, but it can be logically seen as an operational inflection point that exists as optionality for shareholders for now. Which way the scales will fall is yet to be seen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While this analysis may seem largely negative, it lays the foundation for the value reversion trade. This psychological inversion strategy states that when things look bad and the value accurately reflects this, alpha probability increases due to higher normalization and turnaround likelihood.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unisys stock looks like your classic value trap. It really only works as a low-weight optionality investment. I find it unlikely that the investment will crater in price near-term, though we do have to be aware that the post-Q4 uptick introduces short-term downside volatility risk. Nonetheless, from a longer-term perspective, the stock looks structurally undervalued.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58583751-17722052197289195_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1633\" data-height=\"1358\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58583751-17722052197289195_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"UIS One-Day-Intervals Price Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"532\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58583751-17722052197289195_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58583751-17722052197289195_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58583751-17722052197289195_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58583751-17722052197289195_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">UIS One-Day-Intervals Price Chart <span>(Author's Chart)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we can see in the consensus below, the analysts are bullish on FY27. This is the logical inflection window, but it really is just a base effect off of a weak FY26 number. Unisys isn't entering a multi-year compounding cycle. Coverage is also thin, so I would not be shocked by further downward revisions, especially in a microcap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-1772133755336736_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1205\" data-height=\"371\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-1772133755336736_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"UIS Consensus EPS Estimates\" width=\"640\" height=\"197\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-1772133755336736_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-1772133755336736_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-1772133755336736_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58583751-1772133755336736_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">UIS Consensus EPS Estimates <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we look at the valuation grades, the equity looks deeply undervalued.

The stock price will therefore be $4, driving a 70% return. This is the low end of consensus and reflects operational resistance, but a return to baseline and a multiple expansion phase are due to a structurally oversold equity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_74c9f6c1f09a0d997414c654c732b6b6.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_74c9f6c1f09a0d997414c654c732b6b6.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_74c9f6c1f09a0d997414c654c732b6b6.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_74c9f6c1f09a0d997414c654c732b6b6.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Buy</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The risk is high here, but so is the reward, and there is ample margin of safety with UIS. Sometimes you have to have conviction despite what could go wrong, because the greatest alpha is given to those who can spot opportunity off the beaten path. In the case of Unisys, a 70% return is not guaranteed (there is lots that could go wrong), but at less than 3% of NAV, I think this microcap has a value trade in it worth pouncing on. I am buying.</p>",

For the full year, the company earned $1.67. Like many companies, BWIN adjusts GAAP financials for certain expenses; most notably, it excludes share-based compensation, as do some other firms, mainly in the tech sector. While not a cash expense, it is a real cost in the form of dilution, and I do not believe it should be excluded from financials. For the full year, it added back $71 million of share-based comp, or about $0.45/share. Otherwise, EPS is closer to $1.22; this is a significant expense that alters valuation considerations meaningfully. BWIN generated $70 million of EBITDA, up 10bps as margin expanded by 91bps to 20.1%. I would also note that immediately after quarter end, Baldwin completed its merger with CAC Group.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lower premiums and accounting reduce growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Organic growth was just 5% in Q4, down from the 10% reported for the full year, as lower premium inflation limits growth. Beyond this, the company has seen pressure from accounting changes that delay the recognition of revenue. Plus, there has been a meaningful pullback from insurers in the Medicare Advantage space, which reduced growth. Given the fact the Administration is <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/29/nx-s1-5691896/medicare-advantage-health-insurance-trump-oz-cms-upcoding\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/29/nx-s1-5691896/medicare-advantage-health-insurance-trump-oz-cms-upcoding\" target=\"_blank\">targeting</a> this program for further cuts, that weak environment may persist into 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insurance Advisory Solutions (“IAS”) revenue declined by 3% to $158 million, given a 2% drop in organic activity, driving a 19% drop in EBITDA to $24 million. This unit has been particularly hurt by accounting changes that delay recognizing revenue until some policies expire, which has muddled results in 2025. All else equal, they are making growth look especially weak in 2025 and will then support growth in 2026. Absent this impact, revenue and EBITDA were closer to flat from last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, we are seeing a meaningful deceleration in growth, and management said there was a -15% impact on growth from deflationary trends in the property market. BWIN earns commissions that are a share of premiums. The company is seeing that insurers are cutting rates and clients are altering the exposures they are insuring, which together are greatly reducing premiums paid. Premium deflation has been a growing fear around the insurance sector, which has recaptured all margins lost during COVID. Given the fact policies are generally 6-12 months in nature, I expect this lower level of pricing to persist at least through mid-2026, driving negative organic growth in H1 and some stability in H2 as it laps easier comparisons.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Underwriting, Capacity, and Technology (“UCTS”), sales jumped 11% to $130 million, driving a 30% jump in EBITDA to $30 million as margins expanded 340bps to 23%. Finally, Mainstreet Insurance Solutions (“MIS”) revenue grew 7% to $77 million; however, this was entirely due to M&amp;A, with organic growth down 4%. Still, thanks to achieving targeted cost synergies, EBITDA grew 25% to $24 million as margins expanded 460bps to 32%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Leverage is a concern</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the quarter, Baldwin generated $11 million of free cash flow, bringing the full-year total to $87 million. This was down by $5 million from last year. As noted above, it paid out about $71 million of share-based compensation, which accounts for the vast majority of free cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Baldwin targets 3-4x leverage, and it ended the year at 4.1x, a bit above the high end. Pro forma for the CAC Group acquisition, leverage is up towards 4.5x. The company has no maturities before 2029, providing significant financial flexibility. Alongside results, the company announced a $250 million share repurchase program, and management stated this would be the “priority.” As such, I do not expect rapid deleveraging, and BWIN is likely to run at more aggressive leverage for some time to take advantage of the share price decline.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539167624_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1022\" data-height=\"126\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539167624_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"line chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"79\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539167624_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539167624_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539167624_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539167624_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Baldwin</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, the company issued over $500 million of stock to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20326399-the-baldwin-group-and-cac-group-to-merge-creating-the-largest-majority-colleague-owned#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20326399-the-baldwin-group-and-cac-group-to-merge-creating-the-largest-majority-colleague-owned#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" target=\"_blank\">acquire</a> CAC Group. I continue to struggle with Baldwin’s capital allocation policy. Using equity to fund a purchase even after such a large decline suggests management does not view the stock as overly cheap. At the same time, it is now going to start buying back this stock, even though leverage is running higher than it targets. This is a reason I remain cautious about just how accretive this acquisition will be. I expect it will take multiple years to complete this buyback authorization.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook is consistent with my view</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking forward, the company is targeting just over $2 billion of revenue this year, aided by the CAC acquisition. CAC is expected to contribute $72 million of Q1 revenue and about $310 million for the year. This implies mid-single or higher organic growth. As noted above, the company grew 5% in Q4. The insurance premium rate headwind pressure on YoY growth should fade in H2, and accounting deferrals should be less of a pressure. So all else equal, we should see growth in the 5%-7% area in my view, consistent with this guidance. Given ongoing cost-cutting and tech consolidation, it is targeting modest margin expansion. All in, this leads to guidance for $2.00-$2.10 of EPS.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539865947_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1067\" data-height=\"174\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539865947_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"104\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539865947_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539865947_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539865947_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722075539865947_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Baldwin</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in December, I was targeting $1.70 of EPS (including $0.30 of share-based compensation), given an underlying view of $2.00. Guidance is consistent with my December outlook. The midpoint is slightly higher, but this is primarily due to the fact that the CAC acquisition closed a bit earlier than I assumed, providing some incremental earnings. Management’s own run-rate assumptions are similar to my own. Given share-based comp, I now expect EPS of $1.70-$1.75, and I believe this is the more appropriate earnings figure to use when considering valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares are cheap enough to buy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At $22.50, shares are now just 13x earnings. This is certainly not expensive, even as the company is carrying excess debt. That said, fears that AI could disrupt insurance brokerage activity have been a meaningful recent headwind, and we have seen across multiple sectors how AI fears can drive outsized impacts on share prices. Baldwin connects counterparties, and theoretically, this type of activity is an area where AI could excel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In practice, I view more commoditized policies as being an area ripe for AI disruption. Consumers could certainly use AI agents to find the best car insurance quote, for example. I view Baldwin’s Medicare practice as having the largest AI cannibalization risk. However, much of its business is tied to more specialty, commercial policies that are one-off or unique. I expect it will be more difficult to use AI and totally remove the relationship nature of the business. To an extent, one’s view of this comes down to how much you believe the human and relationship aspect of business is a value-add or a friction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I do not view it as a friction, which is why I see AI as unlikely to completely upend the business, especially as BWIN should be able to offset some revenue pressure with cost savings by deploying the technology itself. Frankly, at ~13x earnings, I think shares are attractive, and my one hesitancy is its capital allocation policy whereby its debt load remains a concern, and I am cautious about CAC acquisition benefits.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even with this pressure, I view ~15x as a more reasonable multiple, or about $25.75, especially as there should be some incremental EPS contribution from CAC in 2027 as costs are taken out. As such, even after today’s rally, I see over 10% upside and am upgrading shares to a \"Buy.\"</p>",

I also do not recommend buying Roundhill Magnificent Seven Covered Call ETF (BATS:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAGY\" class=\"ticker-link\">MAGY</a>). My<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> intention with this article is to answer a follower's question. This follower asked me if MAGY was a good option to invest in the magnificent seven and take advantage of the fall by receiving passive income while this turbulent period is occurring for Mag7.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The great truth is that the case is much more complex than how to expose yourself to the Magnificent Seven, and my intention with this article is to carry out an in-depth study of the Magnificent Seven and discuss ways to invest in these companies.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ways to invest in the magnificent seven</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Basically, you have two ways to invest in the Magnificent Seven. The first is to buy the shares of each company separately and actively manage them. The second is to buy ETFs, and currently the manager who stands out most in this area is Roundhill Investments with the MAGS and MAGY ETFs. But what is the difference between the two?</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">MAGS vs. MAGY</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It can be said that MAGS is the traditional ETF that gives equal-weight exposure to the Magnificent Seven (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG?s=goog&amp;source=search\">Alphabet</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\">Apple</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\">Nvidia</a>, and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA\">Tesla</a>). This is an ETF with a buy-and-hold strategy, and you capture almost 100% of the upside or downside of this basket.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, MAGY is the passive income version of this investment vehicle. Basically, the Roundhill manager buys the MAGS ETF and, weekly, sells call options on this ETF, and this sale of calls generates passive income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722058962794974_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"725\" data-height=\"341\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722058962794974_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MAGS vs. MAGY\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"301\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722058962794974_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722058962794974_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722058962794974_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722058962794974_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MAGS vs. MAGY <span>(Seeknig Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MAGS has an expense ratio of 0.29% and $3.49 billion in AUM, while MAGY has an expense ratio of 0.99% and $168 million in AUM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059033140085_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"669\" data-height=\"264\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059033140085_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MAGS vs. MAGY\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"253\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059033140085_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059033140085_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059033140085_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059033140085_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MAGS vs. MAGY <span>(SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is worth noting that investors should not expect MAGY to deliver the same performance as MAGS, as selling calls limits the upside potential, and the higher management fee erodes part of the return.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, answering the follower's question, I don't find MAGY's strategy interesting. Basically, I see no reason to turn growth companies into sources of passive income through derivatives. I would opt for creating an optimized portfolio that would combine stocks of growth and dividend-paying companies, without any derivative structure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For investors who like the convenience of ETFs, I would opt for MAGS. But as I said, in this article I delve deeper into the Magnificent Seven case, and not just into the best way to invest in these companies.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Context</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors must be following the fall in the shares of the Magnificent Seven and, consequently, the compression of their multiples. The case is so interesting that the seven magnificent ex-Teslas already have a lower price-to-earnings ratio than the Consumer Staples sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059114154627_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"886\" data-height=\"593\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059114154627_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The MAG7 Premium\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"428\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059114154627_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059114154627_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059114154627_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059114154627_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">The MAG7 Premium <span>(Compound)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This phenomenon did not take me by surprise. At the end of 2025, I created an article titled “2026 S&amp;P 500 Outlook: The Start Of Natural Selection In AI,” where I predicted this decline in the shares of these companies. It's no surprise that my recommended stock portfolio changed drastically from 2025 to 2026, with the replacement of big tech by dividend-paying Brazilian companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The big point is that none of the hyperscalers want to be left behind in the artificial intelligence race. This can be seen in the comparison between your Capex and Free Cash Flow, as we can see below. These companies are moving from being asset-light to being asset-heavy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059160554407_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"886\" data-height=\"459\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059160554407_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Asset Light to Asset Heavy\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"332\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059160554407_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059160554407_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059160554407_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059160554407_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Asset Light to Asset Heavy <span>(Bloomberg)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is worth remembering that this movement also appears in buybacks. It is interesting to note that large American companies were one of those responsible for boosting the stock market in recent years through their buybacks. However, as these companies are making greater investments, share repurchases are left aside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059209112046.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Buybacks\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"526\" height=\"379\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059209112046.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059209112046.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059209112046.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Buybacks <span>(Wolf Street)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among the magnificent seven, only Apple has significantly lower capex growth estimates than other companies.

After all, in the long term, shares follow the company's ability to generate free cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conceptually, free cash flow is equal to operating cash flow minus CAPEX. Therefore, as long as companies need to increase their CAPEX, free cash flow will be weakened, and at least in 2026, there is no expectation of this CAPEX slowing down so far.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For valuation, I will use the historical price/earnings. Through the chart below, it is interesting to note that MAGS reached 36x earnings in November 2025, and since then, declines in shares have caused the ETF to trade at 28x earnings. This level is still not ideal for me to recommend buying this ETF based on <strong>current market conditions</strong>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059469950316_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"886\" data-height=\"423\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059469950316_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"P/E\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"306\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059469950316_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059469950316_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059469950316_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059469950316_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">P/E <span>(Koyfin)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, I am downgrading my buy-to-hold recommendation for MAGS and also do not recommend buying the MAGY ETF. If the multiple drops to 22x earnings, as happened in April due to Liberation Day, I will be able to reevaluate this investment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Potential Threats To The Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is no doubt that there are several risks to the investment thesis due to the representation that the Magnificent Seven have in the S&amp;P 500, for example. Therefore, any announcement by executives of successful AI investments and a reduction in CapEx projections could cause these companies' shares to rise again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another relevant risk is that MAGS includes the magnificent seven; however, it is also possible to actively manage these companies. Among these seven options, for example, Apple does not present impressive CAPEX growth, and Microsoft, for example, has less aggressive investment levels and a more positive cash flow perspective than other competitors. Therefore, it is worth delving deeper into the investment thesis in these companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059619002347.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FCF vs. Capex / Debt Inssuance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"363\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059619002347.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059619002347.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059619002347.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059619002347.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">FCF vs. Capex / Debt Inssuance <span>(Zero Hedge)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Above I listed the risks of not holding MAGS, or some of the seven magnificent stocks. However, as the recommendation is to hold, we also need to point out the risks of having these companies in our portfolio. As an example, Seeking Alpha's powerful Quant tools suggest selling MAGS. Therefore, the investor must conduct a careful analysis of this ETF and these companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059658972228_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"886\" data-height=\"266\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059658972228_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Quant Rating and ETF Grades\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"192\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059658972228_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059658972228_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059658972228_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59387725-17722059658972228_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Quant Rating and ETF Grades <span>(SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors are completely surprised by the poor performance of the magnificent seven in 2026 compared to the other 493 companies in the S&amp;P 500. This phenomenon is not surprising, because at the end of 2025 I described what I called natural selection of AI, and even at that time I made significant changes to my portfolio of recommended stocks that included a reduction in the number of big techs in the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The central point of the analysis is the heavy investments that companies are making in artificial intelligence so as not to fall behind in the race. Consequently, they are moving from having asset-light models to having asset-heavy models. By definition, higher investments mean lower free cash flow, so stocks tend to suffer.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on this analysis, I am downgrading the buy-to-hold recommendation for MAGS and also do not recommend investing in the Magnificent Seven through MAGY, which is the passive income-generating ETF. However, as I said in this article, if the valuation approaches April, when liberation day occurred, I will be able to reevaluate this ETF.</p>",

Given the plan for the change in the securities portfolio, the Fed would then maneuver its policy rate of interest to support this plan for the securities portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, the Federal Reserve always moved first on the size of the securities portfolio and then brought the interest rate into line with what was needed to support the decision about the securities portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This policy approach is centered around a \"quantity\" and not around an interest rate target.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is my opinion that many participants in the financial markets still don't get this approach. These participants are still in the older Federal Reserve regime where the Fed would primarily target the Fed's policy rate of interest and then bring a \"quantity\" variable into line with whatever the interest rate target happened to be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, we see the movement in the \"quantity\" variable, and then we see adjustments of the rate target to whatever is required by the Fed's \"quantity\" target.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/219293-1772202370083926_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1928\" data-height=\"976\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/219293-1772202370083926_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Effective Federal Funds Rate\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"324\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/219293-1772202370083926_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/219293-1772202370083926_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/219293-1772202370083926_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/219293-1772202370083926_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Effective Federal Funds Rate <span>(Federal Reserve)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here we find ourselves in the time period where the Fed has just started its \"quantitative tightening\" period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the program continued, the Fed adjusted the effective Federal Funds rate to bring the policy rate of interest into line with what was being achieved by the Fed's \"quantity\" stance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In October 2024, the Federal Reserve decided that the market conditions had changed and that to achieve what the Federal Open Market Committee wanted to achieve, the effective Federal Funds rate had to be reduced.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/219293-1772202705005345_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1928\" data-height=\"968\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/219293-1772202705005345_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Effective Federal Funds Rate\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"321\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/219293-1772202705005345_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/219293-1772202705005345_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/219293-1772202705005345_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/219293-1772202705005345_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Effective Federal Funds Rate <span>(Federal Reserve)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And, as can be seen in subsequent months, further reductions took place.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, the Fed was reducing its policy rate of interest, but not nearly at the rate that Trump wanted rates to decline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In late November, the Federal Reserve got to the place where it believed that it was time to move from a policy of quantitative tightening to one of quantitative easing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, the change was made. One can see from the charts at the beginning of this article that the Fed's quantitative easing began in early December 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Once this policy change is made, the question then becomes one about the Fed's policy rate of interest. Should the Fed's policy rate of interest be changed?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On December 9, 2025, the effective Federal Funds rate dropped.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But no other move has been made since…although there has been lots of discussion about whether or not a move should be made.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And, as the month of February has moved along, more and more comments have been made by Federal Reserve officials that maybe it is not time for another move to be made.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, there appears to be a growing consensus that maybe there won't be any more reductions in the Fed's policy rate of interest in the next month or two.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, there is some talk that there may not be any more reductions in the Fed's policy rate of interest this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My concern is not about whether the policy rate of interest should be changed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My issue is with the Fed's choices about the securities portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just how \"easy\" should the Fed's portfolio policy be?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Fed had gone through some 44 months of quantitative tightening.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In December, the Fed \"turned to\" quantitative easing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">How \"easy\" is the Federal Reserve planning to be?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Is the Fed, under the leadership of Jerome Powell, loosening up on Federal Reserve policy in order to make it more difficult for Trump's replacement to have it \"too easy\"?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Powell is making things \"easy\" before Trump's man gets there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Powell is \"setting a standard now\" then it may be much harder to change things too much when the new man gets there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This move also makes it easier for the remaining members of the FOMC to keep further movements smaller because this initial move has already been made.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Obviously, there is a lot of \"game playing\" going on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is no real clear picture of just what might happen going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, the person nominated to be the next Chairman of the Board of Governors has let it be known in the past that he believes that the Fed's balance sheet is too large.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, Mr. Warsh was very uncomfortable in his earlier appointment to the Fed Board because of what Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke was doing to the Fed's balance sheet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Check out \"<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/kevin-warsh-isnt-crazy-the-feds-big-balance-sheet-is-529b28cc?mod=Searchresults&amp;pos=1&amp;page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/kevin-warsh-isnt-crazy-the-feds-big-balance-sheet-is-529b28cc?mod=Searchresults&amp;pos=1&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\">Kevin Warsh Isn't Crazy, the Fed's Big Balance Sheet Is</a>.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But Trump needs a large securities portfolio and a large Fed balance sheet to get the interest rate structure he desires.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next few years at the Fed look like they might be challenging.

The S&amp;P 500 continues to dance in a nervous fashion near all-time highs, though sector leadership is changing drastically. \"Old economy\" companies in the energy and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> materials sectors are rallying, while tech stocks, particularly in the software space, have quickly descended to becoming bargain plays.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another deep bargain is Grindr Inc. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GRND\" title=\"Grindr Inc.\">GRND</a></span>), the gay dating app that rivals Match Group's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTCH\" title=\"Match Group, Inc.\">MTCH</a>) Tinder and Hinge. Shares of Grindr have lost one-third of their value over the past year, not only due to compression in growth rates but also because a recent offer to take the company private at $18 per share was <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4525357-grindr-drops-after-talks-on-take-private-bid-are-ended\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4525357-grindr-drops-after-talks-on-take-private-bid-are-ended\" target=\"_blank\">rejected by Grindr's board</a>. The question for investors now is, can Grindr rebound from here?</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6b92c8ca1238cec437b982653ccb66ab.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6b92c8ca1238cec437b982653ccb66ab.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6b92c8ca1238cec437b982653ccb66ab.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6b92c8ca1238cec437b982653ccb66ab.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846984-grindr-payer-growth-and-privatization-potential\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846984-grindr-payer-growth-and-privatization-potential\" target=\"_blank\">I last wrote a \"Buy\" article on Grindr</a> in November, when the stock was trading around $13 per share. While I never buy any individual stock because of M&amp;A potential alone, I think the removal of buyout possibility for Grindr also eliminates the near-term catalyst that could have triggered share price appreciation in this stock. And while Grindr remains cheap, a number of risks have also popped up, especially as the company moves to report user data less frequently in FY26, giving us less visibility into how the company is remaining competitive with other dating apps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another big factor: while Grindr has always been appealing due to its price, many deep-value buying opportunities have just opened up in the software sector. Once high-flying stocks like HubSpot (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUBS\" title=\"HubSpot, Inc.\">HUBS</a>) and Atlassian (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TEAM\" title=\"Atlassian Corporation\">TEAM</a>) are now trading at deep discounts to their historical multiples. These are enterprise-facing, recurring revenue businesses that are technically \"safer\" than a company like Grindr, whose revenue base depends on its ability to retain users - which may be a shakier proposition amid pending price increases and a weaker macroeconomy. With all of these factors in mind, I'm dropping my rating on Grindr to <span>\"N</span>eutral.\"<strong> </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At current share prices, I see more of a balanced bull-and-bear case for Grindr. On the bright side of the coin:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Grindr's value proposition is accented by the company's recent share buyback proposal. The company noted in its <a href=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/415221501/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/GRND_SHL_Q42025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/415221501/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/GRND_SHL_Q42025.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Q4 shareholder letter</a> that it's expanding its buyback program by $400 million to demonstrate to the markets that it believes its current share price is undervalued (which it more or less has to do when it rejected a take-private offer at $18 per share). This buyback covers nearly 20% of Grindr's current market cap, a huge sum.</li> <li>Taking share as Tinder stalls. Tinder, the world's largest dating app, continues to see a decline in payers, while Grindr is adding both total MAUs (monthly active users) and paid users.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, however, we do have to be cognizant of the risks that the company faces:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Less frequent user data reporting. Beginning in 2026, Grindr is shifting to reporting MAUs on an annual basis. While the company notes this is in line with peers (and main rival Match doesn't report MAUs at all, only paid users), we do think that if Grindr had better news to share, it wouldn't be reducing its cadence of user reporting.</li> <li>Possible blowback after price increases. Grindr is increasing monthly subscription prices on its XTRA and Premium plans to $23 and $45, respectively, from the current $20 and $40, which the company says reflects an expanded feature set. In a tougher macroeconomy where fewer people are willing to pay for internet services, including dating apps, this may end up turning into a headwind rather than a tailwind for the company.</li> <li>Debt load. Grindr has a net debt position of ~$0.3 billion. While its share buyback appears favorable on paper, the buyback is well exceeding the company's adjusted EBITDA profit guidance for 2026 and will likely increase the company's debt load and leverage ratios substantially.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The core balancing factor here, however, is valuation. At Grindr's current share prices near $12, the stock trades at a market cap of $2.16 billion. Netting off the $87.0 million of cash and $395.9 million of debt on Grindr's most recent balance sheet gives us an enterprise value of $2.47 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For FY26, the company is guiding to a minimum of $528 million in revenue (+20% y/y) and $217 million in adjusted EBITDA (+11% y/y), which implies an erosion to a 4.11% margin (versus 44.5% in FY26) if the company only achieves its minimum threshold.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721597152120667_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1218\" data-height=\"1192\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721597152120667_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Grindr outlook\" width=\"640\" height=\"626\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"626\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721597152120667_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721597152120667_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721597152120667_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721597152120667_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Grindr outlook <span>(Grindr Q4 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even if we take Grindr's minimum $217 million EBITDA at face value, the stock trades at 11.4x EV/FY26 adjusted EBITDA<strong> </strong> - a bargain for a company that is achieving &gt;20% y/y revenue growth and does have potential tailwinds from both payer market share growth and price increases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, I also don't think there's any room for upward correction in Grindr's multiples, with the near-term buyout possibility being removed. Amid the abundance of more appealing bargains in the tech sector that are available after the \"SaaSpocalypse\" of 2026, I'd prefer to move to the sidelines here and invest elsewhere.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 Download</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's now run through Grindr's latest quarterly results in greater detail.

This was a sequential reduction versus 15.1 million users in Q3; however, we do note that the company has been cleaning up profiles on its platform, which led to the removal of 350k users in the second half of FY25. As such, we're not clear on whether, excluding these actions, the company grew MAUs sequentially (though growth outside of these profile removals would have been stronger at 6% y/y).</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721597467451336_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"706\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721597467451336_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Grindr user trends\" width=\"640\" height=\"377\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"377\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721597467451336_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721597467451336_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721597467451336_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721597467451336_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Grindr user trends <span>(Grindr Q4 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, average paid users grew 17% y/y to 1.26 million. We can read this result in two ways. First, we note that Match has opened up an additional decimal point on its paid user reporting (in Q3, the company had merely cited 1.3 million paid users). Year-over-year growth rates remained consistent with Q3 (also at 17% y/y growth), but given the sequential downtick in MAUs, it's likely that Grindr also saw a seasonal decline in paid users.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, Grindr is doing materially better than Tinder and Match Group overall. Match's overall payers fell 5% y/y to 13.8 million in Q4, with Tinder facing a 12% y/y decline (partially being cannibalized by Match's own Hinge, which grew 17% y/y but at a much smaller base). This continues to suggest that Grindr is taking market share in the dating app space.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772159763264521_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2826\" data-height=\"1382\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772159763264521_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Match Group results\" width=\"640\" height=\"313\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"313\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772159763264521_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772159763264521_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772159763264521_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772159763264521_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Match Group results <span>(Match Q4 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The big unknown lies next year, when prices increase ~15% for XTRA and ~13% for Premium. The core test will be for Grindr to maintain similar double-digit y/y growth rates in paid users while benefiting from an ARPU bump from higher prices. The company's guidance, which calls for at least 20% y/y revenue growth next year (which implies a meaningful bump from price increases), sets an optimistic tone for the anticipated impacts of this price change.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the profitability front, Grindr's adjusted EBITDA rose 42% y/y to $54.9 million, with margins rising 400 bps y/y to 43.6%.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721597773604975_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1190\" data-height=\"710\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721597773604975_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Grindr adjusted EBITDA\" width=\"640\" height=\"382\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"382\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721597773604975_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721597773604975_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721597773604975_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721597773604975_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Grindr adjusted EBITDA <span>(Grindr Q4 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's expectations of a margin decay next year reflect the recent burst of investments into new features and AI capabilities.

The company will have to prove that it's able to accelerate revenue growth via its subscription price increases next year without triggering substantial user churn in a tough macroeconomy.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Grindr remains cheap, especially given its plans to buy back a substantial amount of stock (and presumably raise leverage in the process). But with so many other bargains available in today's market, I'm choosing to invest my portfolio elsewhere for now.</p>",

Rather, it was their overhead that had increased.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/5/59452134-17623747719030244.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Screenshot\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Quarterly EPS <span>(Screenshot from previous thesis)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This meant that 2025's quarterly EPS numbers were a bit lower than those achieved in Q3 and Q4 of last year. With the balance remaining healthy, it was largely a question of how much one paid for growth. With less than 1% of the American car insurance market and effective dealer-distributor network, I believed they could continue growth. I used then-current EPS figures to calculate future tangible book value (\"TBV\") per share in ten years, with a range of earnings growth possibilities:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>0% CAGR: $53.89</li> <li>10% CAGR: $84.01</li> <li>20% CAGR: $138.49</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Close to $90 per share at the time, ROOT seemed fairly valued, worth buying if it fell below $84. This would price it for low growth and to benefit from a higher Price/TBV multiple than 1, making it effective for low risk and high reward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Full-Year 2025 Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Root's financial performance for 2025 was one of continued growth in the underlying business, but higher costs pulled down on EPS.

With their first GAAP quarter in Q3 2024, Root was more freshly profitable with its book of business at that time, posting Q4 2024 diluted EPS of $1.30, which fell to $0.31 in 2025. Since they entered 2025 profitable, however, the full year's diluted EPS of $2.36 was higher than 2024's $1.83. Policy losses fluctuate in different quarters, as well as acquisition costs. While many focus on EPS alone, a balance sheet is still very important with an insurance company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/59452134-17721290923871918_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1173\" data-height=\"548\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/59452134-17721290923871918_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Screenshot\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"299\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/59452134-17721290923871918_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/59452134-17721290923871918_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/59452134-17721290923871918_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/59452134-17721290923871918_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Balance Sheet <span>(2025 Form 10K)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The year's results show a much better balance sheet. Cash grew by $70M to $669M. Total investments grew by $80M to $391M. Long-term debt remained stable at $200M. Overall, book value per share grew from $13.49 to $18.34 in 2025.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook and Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trading near $57 per share, ROOT is the cheapest it's been in a long time. Let's make the price into a practical matter, however. As Root is an insurance underwriter, stock price is a bet on its future book value per share. Using 2025' diluted EPS of $2.36 as a baseline, we can make growth assumptions about book value per share over time by adding it to the current book value of $18.34.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To simplify things from my previous theses, I'll only show a high end and a low end.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>0% CAGR: $41.94</li> <li>15% CAGR: $73.44</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Flat EPS for ten years gives a book value of $42, while a 15% CAGR would bring it to $73. I didn't mention this before because I was more focused on basic book value, I think Root has maintained profits while growing long enough that we can consider it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/59452134-17721469979385784_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1525\" data-height=\"455\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/59452134-17721469979385784_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Screenshot\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"191\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/59452134-17721469979385784_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/59452134-17721469979385784_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/59452134-17721469979385784_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/59452134-17721469979385784_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Price/Book Histories: ROOT, PGR, ALL <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Above are the last five years of ROOT's P/B, compared to those of Progressive (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PGR\" title=\"The Progressive Corporation\">PGR</a>) and Allstate (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALL\" title=\"The Allstate Corporation\">ALL</a>), simply because they are well-known auto insurance businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PGR has been at 5x plenty of times, and ALL has traded above 2x very often.

The real clincher is their very effective distribution strategy. In addition to B2C from their accessible mobile app, Root has partnered with dealers and manufacturers, seamlessly embedding into partners' platforms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This stands out from the advertising approaches that other insurers take. Over time, cost of acquisition fades away, but advertising budgets do not. At their size, they simply need to penetrate distribution networks well enough to steal market share from other small insurers. They do not need to compete materially with PGR, ALL, or other big players quite so much.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk Factors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are a couple of things that stand out as long-term risk factors, the kind that would affect big and small alike:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Disruption by superior software/AI from a rival</li> <li>Disruption by fully automated self-driving</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Root is an \"insurtech\" play. Just as PGR broke into the scene in the 2010s with its more tech-driven approach, Root is doing the same now. It remains possible that some kind of operational workaround that they haven't anticipated affects them, just as they are affecting their peers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The latter is the more curious one. It's one thing if a better AI agent outplays Root's distribution strategy (even if Root uses AI too). AI that takes the human operator out of driving fundamentally changes the game of auto insurance. S&amp;P Global <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/automotive-insights/en/blogs/2025/08/autonomous-vehicles-future-of-car-insurance\" rel=\"nofollow\">wrote about</a> the mixed ways this could lead to higher or lower premiums:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>As automation reduces crashes, fewer claims are expected, but repair costs may rise. AVs contain expensive components such as lidar, sensors, and high-performance processors known as system-on-chip (SoC). The rise of EVs previews this dynamic. While EVs are safer in some respects and mechanically simpler than internal combustion vehicles, they can still be more expensive to repair due to costly parts, limited technician expertise, and tightly integrated systems.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The question for ROOT shareholders is if fewer claims do not come with higher costs. A smaller risk to underwrite is a smaller premium earned, meaning lower revenue. Root is small enough that it may be able to grow into this trend, but that also relies on awareness and execution of management.
