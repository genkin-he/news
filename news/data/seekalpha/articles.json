As the largest company in the world reports its earnings, it gives us a<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> direct view into the definitive data set for evaluating the health of the AI infrastructure build-out. With that in mind, I’ll review my current rating of the company to assess if it is still one of the great opportunities on the market despite its vast size.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Dynamics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557159-nvidia-non-gaap-eps-of-1_62-beats-by-0_08-revenue-of-68_13b-beats-by-1_9b\">announced yet another double beat</a>, with Non-GAAP EPS of $1.62, a slight beat of 8 cents by NVIDIA’s standards. Revenue came in at $68.13B for the quarter, also a beat of $1.9B and an eye-watering 73% Y/Y increase and a Q/Q improvement of 20%, which is simply crazy considering the size of the company. This suggests that the virtuous cycle of AI adoption remains in its early-to-middle stages, even as the market is currently grappling with concerns about the sustained CapEX. In total, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/171344939\">FY revenue came out at $215.9B</a>, up 65% from fiscal 2025. Gross margin stood at 75%, reflecting exceptional pricing power despite the massive R&amp;D and manufacturing costs associated with leading-edge 3nm and 4nm process nodes. On a FY basis, the small compression in gross margins is linked to a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/399456576_The_Global_Computing_Power_Game_NVIDIA's_Profit_Structure_and_China's_Domestic_Substitution_Under_the_'Chip_Tax'\" rel=\"nofollow\">$4.5B inventory charge recognized in Q1</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can clearly see that NVIDIA is becoming more and more concentrated as the data center segment now accounts for approximately 91.5% of the total top-line, underscoring the industry’s shift from classical machine learning to gen AI. The segment alone generated $62.3B in quarterly revenue, thanks to the sustained strength of the Blackwell architecture ramp and the Blackwell Ultra platform. Overall, the company generated $97B in free cash flow, which is simply staggering, considering where the figure was only a couple of years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Diving deeper segment-wise, the current dominance in the DC segment is not a result of chip sales but a consequence of NVIDIA’s evolution into a full-stack provider of entire data-center -scale computing platforms. This has been highlighted by the surge in networking revenue, which has totaled $11B in Q4, a 263% increase compared to the prior year. This growth reflects the transition from isolated GPU deployments to gigascale AI factories where inter-chip communication is as critical as the compute itself. The networking business has scaled more than tenfold since fiscal 2021, <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-mellanox-for-6-9-billion\" rel=\"nofollow\">after NVIDIA acquired Mellanox</a>. And though you could see a risk in NVIDIA being so reliant on Data center revenue, it is actually increasingly diversifying its customer base away from traditional hyperscalers such as Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) and Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>). That would be related to demand from AI model makers, enterprises and sovereign nations that is accelerating, suggesting that the AI build-out is broadening beyond a handful of tech giants. And this simple dynamic is critical in mitigating the potential risk of an incoming spending digesting period among the top hyperscalers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I also want to touch on sovereign AI, which has been deemed the new geopolitical asset class and is one of the most striking trends in fiscal 2026. The segment involves individual nations in building domestic GPU clusters to ensure that they are not digitally colonized by offshore providers. This has become critical as it tripled in revenue during the year, surpassing $30B. For example, in Japan, <a href=\"https://www.softbank.jp/en/corp/news/press/sbkk/2025/20250723_01/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Softbank is deploying over 10,000 Blackwell GPUs</a> in a revolutionary AI Grid that integrates processing directly into the 5G cellular network. This will allow for low-latency processing for robotics and autonomous vehicles without data ever leaving domestic soil.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I want to say that the quarter has been strong for NVIDIA, yet the market has punished it rather severly considering its beat all around, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557606-nvidia-stands-alone-upbeat-outlook-sends-stock-higher-leaving-mag-7-in-the-red\">by shedding nearly 5.5%</a>. The guidance was also great for Q1 of the company’s fiscal 2027, as it guided for revenue to $78B + or – 2%, which would imply a Y/Y growth rate of 77%. Mainly, I believe that the stock dropped as investors were looking at more than what was characterized as an uneventful report. This is inherently linked to the perceived risks of massive spending in the industry, as some hyperscaler capex is approaching nearly 100% of operating cash flow in some cases. In a way, investors are expecting more than perfection, which is already what NVIDIA is delivering.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the stock dropping while revenue keeps growing at a relentless pace, it means that NVDA is actually becoming cheaper; even at a P/E Non-GAAP of 40.91, it is actually trending at the middle of its peers' range and historically speaking, one of the lowest levels seen since 2019. The company is also seeing its FCF yield tick up as it now reaches 2.1%, as the company continues to be an incredible free cash flow generator. On a forward basis, I believe that it is crazy that NVIDIA is priced at a forward P/E of 23.05, considering its growth and its guidance that will certainly be exceeded in the coming quarter. That would be lower than companies like Oracle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>) at 26.95, and far lower than its closest competitor, AMD, at 48.84. Taking into account a fair ratio that will account for margin strength and market cap, the company's fair P/E would be at around 57x, suggesting that the current levels are pricing in far less optimism than the fundamentals support.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside of its clear moat in hardware, I believe that one of the key advantages of NVIDIA has been its actual software moat, as the firm remains deep in the realm of deployment and inference. This will help in defending CUDA against AMD’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/rocm.html\" rel=\"noopener\">ROCm software stack</a>, which has significantly closed the gap. As the market shifts toward Agentic AI, that requires complex reasoning and low-latency response, the full-stack optimization that the company has been undergoing now provides a productivity advantage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61549894-17721907179161835.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Graph valuation NVIDIA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"476\" height=\"253\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61549894-17721907179161835.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61549894-17721907179161835.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Valuation Metrics <span>(Data from Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Though the company has a large base of potential great growth opportunities, I believe that one that will be key will be the Rubin Architecture and the subsequent inference revolution. The <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/vera-rubin-nvl72/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vera Rubin platform</a> is set to enter mass production in early 2026, ahead of schedule. Rubin is engineered to reduce AI inference token costs by 10x compared to the Blackwell architecture, which will be critical as the industry shifts from training large models to running autonomous agentic AI systems 24/7. Rubin will also integrate HBM4 memory, providing 22 TB/s of bandwidth per GPU, a 2.75x to 2.8x increase over the Blackwell architecture. Internal benchmarks have been suggesting that while a 5MM investment in current infrastructure might generate a certain level of token revenue, a Rubin-based AI factory can produce the same <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/rubin-platform-ai-supercomputer\" rel=\"nofollow\">output for one-tenth the cost</a>. This drop in costs is to make high-level reasoning economically viable for enterprises.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61549894-17721907674761102.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Graph Growth NVIDIA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"477\" height=\"287\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61549894-17721907674761102.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61549894-17721907674761102.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Growth Metrics <span>(Data from SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest risk to NVIDIA’s growth narrative would be the sustainability of the massive spending currently underway by its largest customers. Those giants are projected to spend up to $690B on AI infrastructure in 2026, there is a growing concern that this hasn’t translated into broad-based corporate profits. Plus, CapEX is approaching nearly all of their operating cash flows. If the companies do not see a clear path to monetization, they may enter a digestion period, leading to a sudden revenue plateau.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVIDIA’s market share in AI accelerators is also facing a double assault from both the ASIC revolution and AMD. On the ASIC side, it comes from customers designing their own vertically integrated silicon, such as the AWS Trainium3. AMD’s MI400 series is also designed to challenge the Rubin architecture, particularly in memory-intensive tasks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that the recent earnings have cemented why NVIDIA is the most valuable company on earth, considering that it is the indispensable gatekeeper of the AI revolution. It is now building the technical blueprint of intelligence, and with its annual cadence, the Vera Rubin platform is set to heavily capitalize on the shift from training to inference, which is where the real economic value of AI will be captured. I keep my Strong Buy rating on NVIDIA.</p>",

September 2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a quick overview, VTVT’s pipeline includes the candidate <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06334133\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cadisegliatin</a> (TTP399), which is a GK activator. This candidate is being studied in Phase 3 for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), adjunctive to insulin. Cadisegliatin has a Breakthrough Therapy designation in T1D, yet despite this, VTVT as a whole seems relatively undercovered, so I thought it was worthwhile taking a look at it. After all, VTVT wholly owns Cadisegliatin for this particular indication, which targets a sizable <a href=\"https://www.globalgrowthinsights.com/market-reports/type-1-diabetes-t1d-market-104075\" rel=\"nofollow\">$4.4 billion</a> TAM (by 2035) in type 1 diabetes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, Cadisegliatin also presented positive results from the <a href=\"https://ir.vtvtherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vtv-therapeutics-announces-positive-topline-results-part-1-phase/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Simplici-T1</a> Phase 2 study, with statistically significant HbA1c improvement and a reduction in severe hypoglycemia events. Additionally, the candidate presented a favorable safety profile. The FDA draft guidance in 2023 recognized hypoglycemia endpoints as a clinically relevant efficacy outcome in diabetes trials, an outcome that was already reported in the Phase 2 trial. Before this, diabetes drug development was centered on the benefits through the improvement of hemoglobin A1C.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130169024_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1437\" data-height=\"540\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130169024_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Global Growth Insights.\" width=\"640\" height=\"241\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130169024_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130169024_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130169024_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130169024_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Global Growth Insights.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cadisegliatin is also being studied for Type 2 Diabetes (<a href=\"https://ir.vtvtherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vtv-therapeutics-and-m42s-iros-announce-submission-phase-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">T2D</a>) in Phase 2.

Additionally, HPP737 is studied in Phase 3 for psoriasis, in Phase 2 for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and in Phase 2 in China for atopic dermatitis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239128680124_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"952\" data-height=\"526\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239128680124_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Corporate Presentation.

This is a RAGE antagonist, which is studied in Phase 2 for the treatment of glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer. Another indication is pneumonia, studied in Phase 2/3. Azeliragon is developed globally in partnership with Cantex.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, as I previously noted, I think Cadisegliatin is probably VTVT’s main value driver in the long run. In that sense, it’s worth mentioning that VTVT previously had issues with an unresolved finding in Cadisegliatin’s Phase 2 data. In fact, this setback prompted the FDA to place a hold on VTVT’s Cadisegliatin program. Fortunately, this incident was <a href=\"https://ir.vtvtherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vtv-therapeutics-announces-fda-has-lifted-clinical-hold/\" rel=\"nofollow\">resolved</a> when VTVT demonstrated that the finding was a misleading result produced by the testing method and not by the drug itself.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130210896_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"948\" data-height=\"535\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130210896_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Corporate Presentation.

September 2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe this basically removed a major R&amp;D roadblock for VTVT because the FDA’s reason to place the hold was resolved. Since then, Cadisegliatin’s development of the candidate has returned to being VTVT’s top R&amp;D priority. The company also noted a protocol amendment shortening CATT1 from 12 months to 6 months, with no change to primary endpoints.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, we should get Cadisegliatin’s topline results by 2H2026. Additionally, there is a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/31603272#VTVT-20250930_HTM_ic60bf641e18d443d8fee2fea1792d052_88\">food-effect study</a>. VTVT wants to gather data to see how the drug's effectiveness is affected by food changes. For this, they’ll use healthy volunteers who have taken the drug under the following study conditions: fasting versus fed, low-fat versus high-fat meal. And hopefully, this will be another positive data point that corroborates Cadisegliatin’s safety profile for a potential FDA submission down the road.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation And Risk Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, from a valuation perspective, VTVT currently trades at a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTVT\">$487.9 million</a> market cap. This makes it a microcap with a relatively low trading volume of only 24.1 thousand shares, which, at the current $39.00 PPS, implies a shallow trading liquidity of $0.9 million. Meaning even tiny buy/sell orders can push the stock price significantly, which is why you should anticipate VTVT will remain volatile in the near term. Still, their latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/18900576\">Q3 2025</a> 10-Q report shows their balance sheet holds $98.5 million in cash and equivalents against $0.3 million in notes payable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772223913026539_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1495\" data-height=\"584\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772223913026539_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Seeking Alpha Charts.\" width=\"640\" height=\"250\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772223913026539_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772223913026539_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772223913026539_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772223913026539_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Seeking Alpha Charts.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, it’s a relatively liquid balance sheet, and its book value reached $70.5 million at the end of Q3. However, by February 2026, VTVT also received <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/02/02/3230224/0/en/vTv-Therapeutics-Amends-License-Agreement-with-Newsoara-Biopharma-Co-Ltd-for-PDE4-inhibitor-HPP737.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">$20.0 million</a> related to their license agreement with Newsoara for a worldwide license on a novel PDE4 inhibitor. Therefore, VTVT’s “updated” cash balances are likely closer to $118.8 million if we include the recent licensing deal. That would also increase its book value proportionally by the same amount, to around $90.5 million, indicating a P/B of 5.4. For comparison, their <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTVT/valuation/metrics\">sector’s median</a> P/B is slightly cheaper at just 2.9, suggesting there’s likely some premium embedded in VTVT’s shares at these levels already.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, I also calculate VTVT burned through $5.2 million during Q3 2025. Note that I got this figure by simply adding its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTVT/cash-flow-statement\">quarterly cash flows</a> from operations and CAPEX. And this figure would suggest a cash runway of roughly 22.8 quarters, which is extremely healthy for a clinical biotech like VTVT. However, it’s worth mentioning that VTVT’s cash burn will likely ramp up in the coming quarters. After all, Cadisegliatin’s R&amp;D was halted, as I previously mentioned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239129803114_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1215\" data-height=\"620\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239129803114_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Corporate Presentation.

September 2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But, going forward, VTVT will continue with its research on this candidate, and this will most definitely increase its cash burn. It’s challenging to anticipate how badly this will hit their cash reserves, but management’s investor presentation explicitly says that their runway will last “<a href=\"https://ir.vtvtherapeutics.com/static-files/a7d5327e-a471-475b-b279-0b07d3c08bee\" rel=\"nofollow\">well past</a>” the CATT1 topline readout.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since we should get this Cadisegliatin data point by 2H2026, I believe it substantially derisks VTVT at these levels. Naturally, if VTVT’s trials produce disappointing clinical data, then the stock will likely tumble after announcing those results. This is relatively normal among biotechs, and VTVT should behave similarly. However, on the other hand, if VTVT’s CATT1 data shows the candidate is suitable for a potential FDA submission, then it could be a major catalyst for the stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Worth Speculating</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, VTVT’s investment thesis at this point is pretty simple. If the upcoming CATT1 topline data is positive, then the stock could very well go much higher. T1D is a huge TAM, and given VTVT’s relatively small market cap, I feel a successful drug in this indication could generate substantial revenues over time. Still, as with other biotech stocks, clinical trials aren’t guaranteed to succeed. And in the meantime, VTVT’s cash burn could rise to unsustainable levels in their search for evidence that could warrant an FDA approval. So, until VTVT can actually commercialize Cadisegliatin, it will remain inherently speculative, which is why you should keep your position sizing manageable for now.</p>",

The fund changed its name, ticker, underlying index, and strategy on 8/1/2022. In particular, the fund used to be currency-hedged, and it is not anymore. Therefore, data prior to August 2022 are irrelevant to assess the current strategy, and should not be used in backtests.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DIVI has a portfolio of 413 stocks, a 30-day SEC yield of 3.19%, and an expense ratio of 0.09%. Distributions are paid quarterly. It is quite a large ETF, with $2.4 billion in assets and an average daily volume of $9.5 million. As described in the prospectus by <a href=\"#overview\">Franklin Templeton</a>, the underlying index “<em>includes a security selection and weighting process that aims to deliver a higher dividend yield than the Parent Index</em>.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The methodology uses an optimizer, taking into account some constraints, in particular weight limits for countries, sectors, constituents, and turnover. Despite targeting an enhanced aggregate dividend yield, the optimization under constraints may include stocks that don’t pay a dividend. The index is reconstituted quarterly, and the portfolio’s turnover rate was 26% in the most recent fiscal year. I will use as a benchmark the MSCI EAFE Index, represented by iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EFA\" title=\"iShares MSCI EAFE ETF\">EFA</a>), which has a similar geographical and size universe.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Portfolio</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund is mostly invested in large- and mega-cap companies (91% of asset value). The geographical allocation is close to the benchmark’s, as plotted on the next chart, which includes countries weighting more than 2%. Although the heaviest region is Europe (60% of assets), Japan comes in first position (22.7%), followed by the U.K. (13.8%). Other countries are below 10%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/2496631-1772232232581536.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Country allocation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"605\" height=\"282\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/2496631-1772232232581536.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/2496631-1772232232581536.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/2496631-1772232232581536.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Country allocation <span>(chart: author: data: Franklin Templeton, iShares.)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The portfolio has a focus on financials (28.9%) and significant exposure in industrials (15.6%).

Is it too late to invest? We don’t think so. With<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> valuations still attractive and earnings growth forecasts looking up, this could be the right time to give the developing world a closer look.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings growth could be an important catalyst in 2026. When EM equities surged by nearly 33% last year, our research indicates that valuation expansion drove nearly half the increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That has since changed. Recent gains have been fueled largely by earnings upgrades—a trend we expect to continue. EM earnings are now projected to grow by 18% in 2026, according to consensus estimates, outpacing both the US and other developed markets (DM) (<em>Display</em>). In our view, this suggests a more sustainable foundation for future performance than multiple expansions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Strong Earnings Could Support Emerging Market Returns</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>2026 Consensus EPS Growth (Percent)</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-17722679798882174_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1143\" data-height=\"535\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-17722679798882174_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Strong Earnings Could Support Emerging Market Returns\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-17722679798882174_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-17722679798882174_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-17722679798882174_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-17722679798882174_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Historical and current analyses do not guarantee future results.

For example, valuations in Brazil are more than 35% lower than the MSCI EM. The country appears to be at an important inflection point in its monetary policy cycle, with rates expected to come down from lofty levels. In Brazil and the rest of the developing world, underallocation by global funds is keeping a lid on valuations (<em>Display</em>).

Investing in AI can sometimes feel like chasing the most crowded—and expensive—parts of the US market. But, in our view, some of the more durable earnings streams could come from supplying the infrastructure that enables AI. That’s where we foresee EM gaining a unique foothold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EM companies provide many of the critical building blocks for AI infrastructure, including everything from semiconductor foundries and high-bandwidth memory to data center power and thermal management systems. These “backdoor AI” firms tend to be less speculative and more grounded in long investment cycles. Many of these firms also boast high barriers to entry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regardless of size, many AI suppliers with operations in EM trade at a discount to their US peers. In contrast to the hyperscalers, which have gone on a spending spree, EM tech companies are less capital intensive than their DM counterparts (<em>Display</em>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>EM Tech Companies Offers Potential Upside with Lower Capital Intensity</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>Capex as a Percentage of Sales (Percent)</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-1772265923290493_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1195\" data-height=\"641\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-1772265923290493_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EM Tech Companies Offers Potential Upside with Lower Capital Intensity\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"343\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-1772265923290493_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-1772265923290493_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-1772265923290493_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-1772265923290493_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Past and current analyses do not guarantee future results.

Recently, concerns about software disruptions, monetization of escalating capex intensity and a possible AI bubble have buffeted flagship US AI megacaps. At the same time, hardware and component suppliers in the developing world were largely spared.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Governance Reform: Turning Earnings into Shareholder Value</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But even the strongest companies need stable backdrops in which to operate. Fortunately, corporate governance across the developing world is undergoing a quiet revolution with profound implications for investors. A case in point is South Korea’s “value-up” initiative, which just marked its second anniversary. While Japan’s corporate governance transformation unfolded over a decade, South Korea is still at the beginning of its journey, leaving significant room for improvement and a narrowing of the long-standing “Korean discount.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">South Korean financials are at the forefront of corporate governance reforms, while the country’s conglomerates, including world-leading franchises in memory, autos and defense, are just starting their value-up journey. Efforts to improve shareholder value are afoot in other regions as well. China has encouraged state-owned enterprises to prioritize valuations and shareholder returns, signaling a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4827133-5-overlooked-themes-for-equity-investors-in-china\" rel=\"noopener\">shift toward more market-friendly practices</a>. As part of this initiative, record-high buybacks and dividends have driven shareholder returns.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global Polarization Is Creating New Opportunities</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emerging markets are no stranger to geopolitical risk. Trade tensions, policy uncertainty and currency volatility can all weigh on investor confidence. But polarization is reshaping global supply chains in ways that create new opportunities for EM companies. Many countries are rerouting trade, diversifying production and building new linkages—reflecting a world in which growth drivers are becoming less synchronized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Energy is a good example. The surge in global demand for liquified natural gas (LNG) is creating more demand for LNG carriers, one of the most technically demanding categories in shipbuilding. Historically, Chinese and Korean shipyards have dominated this space, but shifting trade relationships are changing market share patterns. As US–China tensions have intensified, many western companies have become more cautious about placing orders with Chinese yards involved in sensitive energy routes. Korean shipbuilders, with a long track record of strong safety credentials and established relationships, have been clear beneficiaries of this shift—an example of how trade tensions can create new opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because the developing world is so immense, we believe it’s best navigated through skilled active management. Active, bottom-up investors can tap into a wide range of attractive investment opportunities at compelling valuations. EM have seen fits and starts before, but we see a clear difference between past short-cycle rebounds and what’s transpiring now—an increasingly earnings-based recovery that could have plenty of room to run.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>The views expressed herein do not constitute research, investment advice or trade recommendations and do not necessarily represent the views of all AB portfolio-management teams.

We are swinging between the \"War Premium\" and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the \"Peace Pivot,\" and for the disciplined investor, volatility is where the real money is made. I’ve been calling this the </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Silver Peace Prize</strong></em><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> because IF the world celebrates a potential end to current conflicts, </span><strong class=\"paywall-full-content\">the market is about to hand us a once-in-a-generation entry point for silver, gold, and uranium miners.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trump is finally closer to a deal in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, and Putin is at the table. We know the 47th President has his eyes on the Nobel Peace Prize, and that means a compromise with Iran is no longer a fringe theory; it’s a distinct possibility. Meanwhile, <strong>silver has spent the last year acting less like a metal and more like a high-beta fear gauge. It’s the VIX in physical form.</strong> If we get a handshake in Geneva or a breakthrough in the Middle East, the <em>safety trade</em> will unwind with the force of a hurricane.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We’ve already seen the preview. When the \"Dmitriev Package\" leaked (you can read about it in my last article <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4876324-petrodollar-2-0-why-russias-dollar-pivot-could-crash-gold-and-silver\">here</a>), that massive proposal to bring Russia back into the dollar system and the lower fuel prices that would ensue, silver didn’t just dip; it cratered to $74. When Mark Carney reportedly walked out of those tense tariff negotiations with Canada, we saw it snap back to $80. This volatility is a masterclass in psychological warfare. But here is the secret: once the war fear is gone and the political risk premium has forced silver and gold down, the market will wake up to a cold, hard physical reality.<strong> Even in a peaceful world, there simply isn't enough silver</strong> to power the AI data centers, the global solar rollout, and the next-gen defense industry. Furthermore, America still has to pay for its ballooning debts, putting a floor under gold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m looking for a <em>Peace Crash</em> to bring silver to the $65 to $68 range. There is strong historical support at $48. This should be the floor, $10 below the critical support where the bankers who are short finally get their cover and the smart money steps in. My limit orders are already set between $64 and $66.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I won’t be caught up in the noise or the panic IF the PEACE with Iran headlines hit. I’m waiting for the <em>Sale of the Century</em> to buy silver miners because I know who is waiting on the other side of the world. Chinese markets. If silver is sitting at $65 while the West is panicking about the price drop, the Chinese Central Bank and private hoarders will gobble up every available ounce. I plan to have my bids filled before they even log in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this scenario, <strong>my<em> Peace Price</em> buy list is ready</strong>. I’m looking at the high-beta juniors that get punished the most during these macro shocks. When silver drops 20%, these juniors can drop 40% or more on pure emotion. That is where you find the life-changing upside. I’m focusing on the <em>American Soil</em> plays and the high-grade Canadian explorers. IF the <em>Peace Prize</em> drama plays out, don't lose sight of the uranium and gold sectors; they will also fall, giving us the unique opportunity to buy and hold at lower prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>If the Iran talks fail, gold will snap back toward $5,500 very quickly.</strong> And if the Strait of Hormuz sees even a whisper of a blockade, oil and uranium will go through the roof. Iran’s primary leverage is its enrichment capability. If war starts, those facilities are the first targets, creating a<em> Nuclear Catalyst</em> that removes any hope of Iranian supply and forces global panic buying of yellowcake. In contrast, a future deal with Russia brings massive uranium back on line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The silver markets are currently in a tug-of-war between <em>scary news</em> and <em>hopeful news</em>, which is causing wild swings in the metal. If the US goes to war with Iran and silver tests much higher highs, I will take profits when silver hits $130 to $180, as I will also do on my uranium portfolio due to the unprecedented possibility of the deflation of the de-dollar trade as Putin negotiates selling oil to Europe in dollars again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But even if we get Putin’s \"Grand Bargain,\" AND a peace deal with Iran, I remain fundamentally, unshakably bullish on the metals for the long term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is why the Silver Bull isn't over:</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p><strong>The Physical Deficit:</strong> We are in a structural shortage that no Peace Treaty can fix. The world is using more silver than it mines for the sixth year in a row. In a war with Iran, industrial demand for silver (defense systems, electronics) spikes just as investors try to buy every physical ounce.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Debt Disaster:</strong> U.S. debt-to-GDP is exploding. Neither party has the political will for austerity, and the <em>hidden tax</em> inflation is the only way out.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The AI &amp; Solar Hunger:</strong> AI hardware and high-voltage data centers are silver-hungry. You can't run the future on paper dollars; you need the physical conductivity of silver and uranium to fuel it.</p></li> <li><p><strong>BRICS and the Great Divorce:</strong> Even if Putin uses the dollar for a few years to stabilize his economy and the dollar, the move toward commodity-backed trade isn't stopping. China and Russia aren't going to stop gobbling up gold, silver, and uranium.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Credit Crunch:</strong> We are looking at a shaky year as commercial real estate loans come due and regional banks are forced to mark-to-market and tech stocks come back down to earth. When the credit freeze happens, people will run back to the only assets with no counterparty risk.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <em>Dollar Strength</em> we will see from a Putin deal will be a headwind to the metals, not just a temporary political phenomenon. Yet, the scarcity of these metals is a permanent physical reality. I’m keeping my cash ready for the <em>Peace Floor</em> so I can buy the best silver miners in the world at a huge discount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To play this <em>Snap-Back</em>, I am focusing on the<em> Quality Tier</em> of the market, the companies that have shown the most resilience and have the highest probability of leading the charge back as silver rebounds to $125 and beyond.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p><strong>Wheaton Precious Metals (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WPM\" title=\"Wheaton Precious Metals Corp.\">WPM</a>):</strong> This has been the absolute standout of the year. While other miners have felt the sting of the recent crashes, Wheaton has held its ground. They have the cleanest exposure to silver prices without the mining inflation. They are the smart money bunker.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Hecla Mining (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HL\" title=\"Hecla Mining Company\">HL</a>):</strong> The largest producer in the U.S. Hecla. It's the poster child for American mineral independence. They have the margins to survive a dip to $60 but will explode when the war fear is replaced by industrial scarcity.</p></li> <li><p><strong>First Majestic Silver (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AG\" title=\"First Majestic Silver Corp.\">AG</a>):</strong> Shorted and volatile, this is the ultimate short squeeze candidate when the pivot happens. They will snap back very quickly.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Silvercorp Metals (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SVM\" title=\"Silvercorp Metals Inc.\">SVM</a>):</strong> They have consistently managed to keep costs low through the chaos. It’s a solid, high-yield play for those who want to hold through the macro shocks.</p></li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Action I will be taking if war is declared on Iran</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The structural fracturing (<a href=\"https://www.investing.com/analysis/silvers-great-divorce-of-2026-why-the-100-breakout-is-just-the-beginning-200673833\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Great Divorce</a>) of the physical from the paper silver market is no longer a theory; with silver at $94 and the COMEX vaults compromised, <strong>we are witnessing a generational physical squeeze</strong>. According to<a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/market/commodities/silver-inventory-on-comex-falls-below-90-million-ounces-what-does-this-mean-for-investors-11771836981544.html\" rel=\"noopener\"> this week’s market analysis of official CME data</a>, registered silver inventories have plummeted below the critical 90 million ounce mark, while open interest exceeds available stock by over 400%. We are now in force majeure territory. If I see news that the COMEX has officially suspended trading or has moved to Cash Settlement Only, it will signal the final decoupling where the paper price fails and the value of physical metal and high-grade miners goes viral. I will be getting ready to sell quickly in the peak of the panic as this and war news sends the metals parabolic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>My exit strategy is clear:</strong> I am holding my miners for the $130–$180 War Peak and will be harvesting gains as the mining equities inevitably catch up several days after the spot price surges as news of war breaks out. If silver hits $130, the liquidity vacuum will force the miners up vertically in a matter of hours. The physical reality of a 6-year deficit may finally break the paper manipulation. At the same time, a physical delivery crisis collides with a wartime supply deficit. <strong>The perfect storm will send gold and silver, the safe haven physical VIX parabolic.</strong></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Historically, once a commodity breaks its all-time high (the $122 level we hit in January), it enters Price Discovery. The first day silver gaps to $120, I expect the miners will be lagging. The move from $122 to $140 and beyond will be driven by FOMO and panic buying from short-sellers who are being liquidated. I will wait for the third day of the vertical move when the retail FOMO hits and people buy the miners because they can't find physical silver. I will also sell my uranium portfolio on the war premium due to the unprecedented possibility of the hit of future deflation of the de-dollar trade as Putin works with Trump to sell oil in US dollars again, propping up the greenback and pushing us unexpectedly towards petrodollar 2.0.</p>",

On an initially sharp, now steady decline since last July, SEZL had been trading below $60 per share before this earnings call.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/49307751-17718754789722736_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"751\" data-height=\"408\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/49307751-17718754789722736_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"gains\" width=\"640\" height=\"348\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/49307751-17718754789722736_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/49307751-17718754789722736_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/49307751-17718754789722736_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/49307751-17718754789722736_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SEZL assumes the credit risk and pays merchants upfront, collecting payments from consumers over time. Typically, the consumer would pay for a quarter of the purchase, with the three additional quarter payments coming every two weeks thereafter. They target millennial and Gen Z consumers, a demographic that increasingly prefers short‑term, transparent financing over traditional credit options. I believe in the industry growth trends through BNPL that SEZL is a part of, and think they are a leader in the field. They are smaller compared to a few similar peers but have seen tremendous growth, efficiently profitable operations, and customer and subscription strength. I rate SEZL a buy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What’s Caused the Correction? (Risk)</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I normally end my articles with a risk perspective, but here let’s see what has caused much of this correction and where the risk lies. In August, SEZL reported very strong Q2 results, and immediately saw its stock price tumble over 30% as a major sell off took place with investors taking their profits and running for the hills. Volume was unusually high and seemed to flip the script for the stock moving forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside of standard stock movement, broader industry trends and investor sentiment have weighed on the stock. The BNPL sector has matured in recent years but still has plenty of room to gain the trust of investors. There is always credit risk with consumers, especially the higher-risk customers that SEZL often loans to. Managing defaults carefully will always be important, but so far has not created any issues for the firm. Economic headwinds, credit volatility, and merchant adoption are key factors that investors need to watch for SEZL. The fintech space is highly competitive, but after a deep dive on trends, numbers, and strong forecasts, I still think SEZL is in a good spot.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Users Not Slowing Here</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49307751-177210817928154_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1552\" data-height=\"770\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49307751-177210817928154_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"users\" width=\"640\" height=\"318\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49307751-177210817928154_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49307751-177210817928154_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49307751-177210817928154_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49307751-177210817928154_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SEZL</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Active consumers hit over 3 million for the first time this quarter and were up 2.6% from Q3, and 12% YoY.

Transaction-related costs as a percentage of revenue were down this quarter, as management notes AI-driven efficiency and strong marketing strategy results. Operating expenses grew by only 10.8%, leading to a massive 79% YoY gain in operating income to $55.2 million for Q4 and an improved operating margin to 42.5%.

It’s obvious in the chart above the volatility the stock has seen, but it is the only one of the group in the green over the last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SEZL has a forward-looking PE ratio of just under 18x. This is above the sector median, but lower than all the peers in this group outside of the behemoth in PYPL. From a historical valuation standpoint, SEZL is discounted by over 3x from its price peak last summer. The stock is at a major discount right now. It hasn’t been this low since the stock broke out in early 2025; it’s lower than many peers in the industry, and lower than the broader market average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/49307751-17718754789776773_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"866\" data-height=\"206\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/49307751-17718754789776773_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"margins\" width=\"640\" height=\"152\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/49307751-17718754789776773_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/49307751-17718754789776773_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/49307751-17718754789776773_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/49307751-17718754789776773_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Macrotrends</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profits are not a problem for SEZL. Gross margin is at all-time highs, north of 80%, near double that of the peers seen above. Net income margin is 27.65%, with the closest competitor being PYPL at 15.78%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Total cash is much less than its larger peers, naturally by size. However, SEZL has managed their debt intelligently and has seen a great impact on the balance sheet. They have reduced their debt to equity from about 98% to recently roughly 76% over the last 5 years or so. Their current and quick ratios both hovered between 1.0 and 2.0 for years. Over the last 5 quarters or so, this has emerged above 3.0 for each metric. If SEZL can continue its cash from operations trend, while allocating cash as expenditures appropriately, this gap will continue to widen. Cash from operations was $154.3 million in Q4, light-years above any other quarter they have reported.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SEZL took another big leap with their Q4 earnings report. Sales and subscription growth are rapid. Customer retention and user expansion remain solid as much of the industry has seen slowing. Operations are running on all cylinders, with margins hitting all-time highs and smashing all of their larger scale peers. Management has already forecasted that 2026 will see another 25%-30% increase in revenue, and a 32% hike in year-end adjusted net income.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is risk in the BNPL space. Credit, economic headwinds, lowering merchant adoption and trust, are possibilities that can halt this field. But, if you’re looking for a growth opportunity, there is a lot to like about SEZL. The stock trades at a big discount, profits are being generated with ease, and management forecasts are confident. I think the script has been flipped for SEZL, and this stock is poised to make a strong run this year ahead.</p>",

Like US auto lender Tricolor Holdings, MFS was a nonbank finance firm looking to fill a gap that major banks had ignored or shunned, while tapping those Wall Street giants for the cash to do it. And like auto parts supplier First Brands Group, the banks took comfort in tangible collateral, only for accusations of double-pledging to rattle that assurance. Even some of the names were the same: Banco Santander SA and Jefferies Financial Group Inc. - both stung by First Brands in recent months - are once again scrambling to recoup whatever money they can from an embattled company. This time, they're alongside the likes of Apollo Global Management Inc.'s Atlas SP Partners, Barclays Plc, Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Castlelake LP. 'For the last six months the market has been constantly talking about how to prevent fraud,' said Nicole Byrns, founder of asset-based finance fund Dumar Capital Partners.

Oracle CDS jumped seven to 164 bps - up 112 bps in five months to the high since the Great Financial Crisis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Treasuries enjoyed notable safe haven demand. Ten-year Treasury yields sank 15 bps to a four-month low of 3.94%. Five-year Treasury yields fell 15 bps to an almost 17-month low of 3.50%, and two-year yields dropped 10 bps to 3.37% - the low back to August 2022. High yield spreads-to-Treasuries widened 21 this week to a three-month high 291 bps - the largest increase since October. Interestingly, investment-grade spreads caught fire this week. The seven bps increase was the largest widening since \"liberation day\" (to a 3-month high 291bps).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">February 24 - Bloomberg (Yash Roy and Bruce Douglas): \"A few weeks ago, analysts at UBS Group AG laid out a worst-case scenario for defaults in the private credit sector. Their outlook just became more grim. Strategists including Matthew Mish say private credit could see default rates surge as high as 15%, two percentage points more than the firm forecast less than a month ago, if artificial intelligence triggers an 'aggressive' disruption among corporate borrowers. 'What is new: a clearer catalyst - rapid, severe AI disruption,' according to the UBS strategists... Direct lenders that took a lead role in financing software companies in recent years now look dangerously exposed to AI's impact, stirring comparisons to the 2008 financial crisis. Some estimates suggest that the firms have 40% of all sponsor-backed loans tied up in the software industry.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"What is new: a clearer catalyst - rapid, severe AI disruption.\" It's certainly reasonable to target AI disruption risk as a catalyst. The critical unfolding issue is destabilizing tightening of Credit and liquidity conditions that commenced with last fall's late-cycle cockroach sightings (i.e., First Brands and Tricolor). Late-cycle high-risk lending is inherently susceptible to abrupt shifts in perceptions. Notions of endless marketplace liquidity ensure loose Credit standards and aggressive lending - and consequences.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yields associated with high-risk lending offer exceptional profit opportunities throughout the daisy chain of Wall Street loan intermediation - lending, structured finance, leveraged speculation, insurance, and asset management. So-called \"private Credit\" ranks high on the list of history's greatest high-risk lending and speculative Bubbles. And as financial flows inundated the sector, \"subprime\" corporate Credit enjoyed an extended period of unprecedented access to finance. This boom held delinquencies and defaults at artificially low levels. Investor/speculator returns remained artificially elevated - providing Wall Street quite an earnings bonanza.

That has some parts of the financial world on edge. A few trends - the AI scare trade and the retail investing boom - are colliding at once and stressing a trillion-dollar-plus piece of the economy… Facing high demand from investors in one of its funds to get their money back, Blue Owl sold off assets. It also changed the way redemptions at the fund operate, setting off alarm bells. Asset managers like Blue Owl, as well as better-known firms like Blackstone and KKR, take in money from investors to create funds that typically lend to mid-market businesses, like smaller nonpublic companies that don't issue high-grade bonds. That investor money gets locked up for a while. Historically, that was OK because investors were often deep-pocketed institutional types, insurance companies or pension funds not apt to need to cash out very often. The dynamic started shifting about five years ago when retail stock investing started booming, and everyone seemingly had a Robinhood account and a stock strategy.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The week further confirmed that the high-risk lending cycle has decisively turned.

But such a shift would trade public transparency for a much more leveraged and secretive structure, the analysts said...

The resulting selling has been broad, sweeping up stronger credits… Roughly 15% of CLO collateral is tied to software, increasing to about 20% in private credit CLOs.

Chief Executive Officer Harvey Schwartz suggested that asset managers should have been more forthcoming about the relative illiquidity of investment funds sold to individual investors. 'The industry did itself a bit of a disservice calling the vehicles semi-liquid,' Schwartz said... 'We just should have called them 'sometimes not liquid at all.' The industry's push into retail wealth has attracted scrutiny over whether private investments are appropriate for individuals… Retail products are sometimes marketed as 'semi-liquid' because they allow quarterly or monthly redemptions until they hit a certain limit.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"Sometimes Not Liquid at All\" is an almost unalarming comment with alarming ramifications. Crises erupt when the perception of safety and liquidity is suddenly recognized as a misperception. Traditionally, bank deposits and money market instruments have been the epicenter of the shocking and destabilizing realization that what was believed safe and liquid \"money\" was instead a risk asset vulnerable to significant losses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the mortgage finance Bubble period, I highlighted mounting risks associated with the \"moneyness of Credit\" - in particular the perception of safety and liquidity for \"AAA\" MBS, ABS, mortgage derivatives, and structured finance (i.e., CDOs/CLOs). Over the global government finance Bubble period, I've often referred to the \"moneyness of risk assets.\" Decades of Fed/government market backstops, liquidity injections and unending loose conditions ensured the perception of safety and liquidity for an ever wider swath of financial assets - certainly including shares of thousands of ETFs across various asset classes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">February 23 - Associated Press (Alex Veiga): \"For years, individual investors were dismissed by some on Wall Street as 'dumb money.'

The study also found that last year trading in the leveraged single-stock ETFs accounted for 8% of total trading on all U.S. exchanges.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Way too much Credit and liquidity risk has been distributed to the ETF complex. This will come back to haunt system stability. And it's interesting to read about the recent forced loan sales from troubled \"private Credit\" vehicles sold to entities that appear ready to shift this risk to CDOs (collateralized debt obligations) and other structured Credit products. Sure brings back memories of 2007/2008.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">February 23 - Bloomberg (Silas Brown, Olivia Fishlow, Leonard Kehnscherper and Ellen DiMauro): \"Blue Owl Capital Inc.'s co-chief reeled off all the times he'd seen this type of fear before. Covid. Silicon Valley Bank's collapse. Liberation Day. Marc Lipschultz was addressing analysts on the 11th straight day of losses for the firm's shares, the worst streak since Blue Owl went public almost five years ago… But as Lipschultz saw it, this was par for the course when markets get jittery… It appears different now. Blue Owl last week permanently shut the gates on one of those funds - preventing investors from withdrawing their cash every three months as they'd previously been allowed - and began selling assets to return investor capital. It's the latest sign of tumult in a $1.8 trillion market… 'The red flags we are seeing in private credit today are strikingly familiar to those of 2007,' said Orlando Gemes, chief investment officer of Fourier Asset Management. He pointed to worsening lender protections and convoluted liquidity terms that 'obscure the mismatch between what investors believe they own and what they can actually exit'.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Understandably, Blue Owl's Marc Lipschultz and others would like to believe that current \"private Credit\" instability is similar to market challenges previously surmounted - i.e., Covid, SVB, \"liberation day,\" etc. But today's backdrop is strikingly different.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'll posit that those past episodes were characterized by bouts of speculative deleveraging and attendant liquidity issues that risked bursting inflating Bubbles in high-risk leveraged lending and \"private Credit.\" Deleveraging was reversed, and it was repeatedly off to the races.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's the opposite today. Importantly, faltering high-risk lending markets are at the cusp of triggering speculative deleveraging. The resolution of deleveraging risk will not today resolve leveraged lending and \"private Credit\" issues.

Some 23% of survey's investment-grade respondents saw the threat of an AI bubble as their top concern, up from 9% in BofA's previous survey in December. Worries over a potentially unsustainable surge in investment and valuations of AI companies overtook 'Bubbles in Credit' as the top concern… Anxiety over trade tensions and a global recession had also been seen as the biggest perceived risk during 2025.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">February 26 - Financial Times (George Steer and Rachel Rees): \"Investors are riding out the 'whack-a-mole' software sell-off by loading up on protection against volatility and exploiting the divergence in sectors tipped to be either winners or losers from AI's advance. Some of Wall Street's biggest players are turning to complex options and hedging strategies to navigate a market buffeted by blog posts and headlines that have recently wiped tens of billions of dollars off the value of some of the S&amp;P 500's largest tech groups.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are parallels between today's faltering \"subprime\" Bubble and 2007. Subprime blowup ramifications were widely dismissed throughout 2007 and into 2008. Not appreciated was how high-risk mortgage lending had evolved to become the key marginal source of Credit sustaining housing Bubble inflation in key markets - and how huge quantities of risky loans had been intermediated into perceived safe instruments. The collapse of subprime lending and loan intermediation triggered a dramatic tightening in Credit conditions at the \"periphery.\" Mounting housing inventories and falling prices led to a contagious crisis of confidence in mortgage finance more generally (subprime to Alt-A to prime). The harsh realization of Trillions of mispriced mortgage Credit instruments unleashed powerful crisis dynamics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, the systemic importance of \"private Credit\" is similarly dismissed, despite markets for leveraged loans and high-risk lending having inflated so far beyond the subprime mortgage market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Importantly, today's deteriorating Credit market is on a collision course with the AI mania and arms race. I couldn't help but associate the poor response to blockbuster Nvidia earnings as confirmation that the market is increasingly questioning the viability of financing requirements for a $3 TN plus AI investment boom. The bottom line is AI finance is high risk, and the marketplace is already chin deep in risky Credit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">South Korean stocks were up another 7.5% this week (48% y-t-d), with Japan's Nikkei Index (up 16.9%) and the Shanghai Composite (4.9%) higher by 3.6% and 2.0%.

The Institute of International Finance said… governments' investments in national security were the primary driver behind last year's $28.8tn rise, with spending on AI and similar technologies also contributing to what was the biggest annual increase in the global debt burden since the Covid-19 pandemic. The IIF figures, which combine the debt burden for governments, companies and households, also showed that, as a share of global output, global debt ratios declined for a fifth consecutive year to around 308% of GDP.

The Supreme Court's ruling on US President Donald Trump's tariffs is one of those moments. On its face, the ruling looks like a knockout punch. In a 6-3 decision, the court held that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act's authorisation to 'regulate importation' does not include the power to impose tariffs. Because tariffs raise revenue, the majority concluded, they are in effect taxes - and taxes require explicit congressional approval. But look carefully at what the court actually did. It ruled that the IEEPA does not authorise tariffs. That's all. The court did not declare tariffs unconstitutional. It did not strike down section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. It did not invalidate section 301 of the Trade Act. It did not question the use of sections 122, 201 or 338. It did not revive the 'nondelegation' doctrine. And only three justices relied on the 'major-questions' doctrine, meaning the court created no sweeping precedent limiting presidential trade authority. In fact, even as the court struck down the IEEPA tariffs, it acknowledged that the president retains broad and powerful authority under numerous other statutes to impose tariffs.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">February 23 - Axios (Courtenay Brown): \"When the Supreme Court threw out the Trump administration's use of a novel emergency tool to implement tariffs Friday, the White House quickly turned to a different novel emergency tool - but economists and lawyers are now questioning its legality as well.

But does the U.S. fit those circumstances? The nation is not exhibiting the typical symptoms: plunging currency, spiking interest rates or a freezing-up of foreign capital flowing in.

Cooling inflation across major economies, resilient economic growth and improving visibility on corporate earnings supported investor confidence, despite ongoing geopolitical and policy uncertainty. Risk sentiment was<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> further boosted by selective central bank easing and year-end portfolio rebalancing, underpinning gains across global equities. The S&amp;P 500® Index increased by 2.65% for the quarter. Within the index, eight of the 11 Global Industry Classification Standard ('GICS') equity sectors finished in positive territory, led by health care and communication services. Value stocks outperformed growth stocks. Among other major equity benchmarks, the MSCI EAFE Index, a measure of developed markets excluding the US and Canada, increased by 4.86%, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index increased by 4.73%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fixed-income market performance in developed markets was generally positive. The Bloomberg® US Aggregate Index returned 1.10%. The Bloomberg Global Aggregate Hedged Index returned 0.78%, while the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Unhedged Index returned 0.24% during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the US, equities generally advanced during the fourth quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average® increased by 4.03%, while the NASDAQ 100 Index® increased by 2.47%. US fixed-income markets also posted gains. Markets proved resilient amid elevated uncertainty driven by a prolonged federal government shutdown and ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Inflation, as measured by the headline consumer-price index, eased gradually from 3.0% year-over-year in September to 2.7% year-over-year in November. Labor market data, while disrupted and delayed, pointed to slowing momentum rather than a sharp deterioration. Economic growth remained firm, with third-quarter gross domestic product ('GDP') rising at a solid 4.3% annualized, supported by consumer spending and government outlays despite softer retail sales and business investment. Against this backdrop, the Federal Reserve cut rates by 25 basis points (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BPS\" title=\"BPS Technology Public Company Limited\">BPS</a>) early in the quarter, while maintaining a cautious tone and reaffirming a data-dependent policy stance as markets looked ahead to 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Equity markets in developed economies were broadly higher during the quarter. In the eurozone, fourth-quarter data signaled easing inflation and mixed growth dynamics. Inflation moderated toward the European Central Bank's (ECB's) 2% target, while business activity improved and GDP grew modestly, enabling the ECB to keep rates unchanged throughout the quarter. UK inflation declined steadily from elevated levels, while growth weakened and labor markets softened. The Bank of England shifted from holding rates earlier in the quarter to a 25-bp cut at its December meeting. In Japan, inflation remained above target and unemployment stayed low, despite a third-quarter GDP contraction and softer activity indicators. As a result, the Bank of Japan ended its hold with a late-quarter 25-bp hike, continuing its normalization effort.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emerging-market equities were positive for the quarter. In China, growth slowed from earlier in the year, and consumer and property-sector weakness persisted; however, data showed tentative stabilization, as manufacturing and services activity returned to slight expansion, enabling the People's Bank of China to keep lending rates unchanged throughout the quarter. Brazil's economy softened into the fourth quarter amid widening external deficits and weaker activity indicators. Nonetheless, the central bank maintained its restrictive 15% policy rate despite easing inflation. India stood out with solid momentum, posting robust GDP growth, rising industrial output and relatively contained inflation, supported by government commitments to greater capital spending and reform. In contrast, Mexico faced weak growth and a third-quarter contraction, prompting successive rate cuts as inflation eased. Argentina bolstered financial stability through a sizeable currency-swap agreement and improving US export prospects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Commodities were slightly higher, with the Refinitiv/CoreCommodity CRB Index rising 0.35%. During the fourth quarter, precious metals posted solid gains, with gold, silver and platinum supported by safe-haven demand amid geopolitical tensions, a US government shutdown and a weaker US dollar, culminating in a robust year-end rally. In contrast, energy markets were softer. Oil prices trended lower throughout the quarter as ample global supply, rising inventories and slowing demand outweighed geopolitical risks. Natural gas was volatile, rising early in the quarter on colder weather, liquefied natural gas export demand and seasonal heating needs, before ending the year lower as weather-driven strength faded. The US dollar weakened against a basket of major currencies.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Quarterly Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BNY Mellon Small Cap Value Fund (Class A at NAV) underperformed its benchmark, the Russell 2000 Value Index, during the fourth quarter of 2025.

Notably, out-of-index optical and photonics firm Lumentum Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LITE\" title=\"Lumentum Holdings Inc.\">LITE</a>) saw significant tailwinds following the expansion of its US-based semiconductor facility.

Inflation continues to moderate, with the US consumer-price index ('CPI') up 2.7% year-over-year and core CPI up 2.6% year-over-year in November, while wage growth and consumer spending have cooled without pointing to recession. In December, the Federal Reserve (Fed) lowered its target range to 3.50%–3.75%, signaling a shift toward easing while reaffirming a data-dependent approach amid mixed committee views. Global growth forecasts hover around 3.2% for 2025 and 3.1% for 2026. Supportive factors include selective fiscal measures in China and a gradual recovery in Europe, while trade policy uncertainty and geopolitical risks remain notable headwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Corporate earnings remain resilient, with S&amp;P 500 earnings per share up nearly 13% in the third quarter and projected to rise 8% in the fourth quarter, underpinned by solid margins and improving breadth beyond mega-cap technology. However, forward price-to-earnings ratios are near 21.8, elevated versus historical averages, suggesting limited capacity for multiple expansion without additional rate relief or better-than-expected earnings. In our view, international equities, particularly developed-market value segments, offer relative attractiveness with potentially lower multiples and higher dividend yields, while thematic opportunities in AI infrastructure, electrification and energy transition may continue to draw capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, equities appear biased toward modest gains rather than outsized rallies. Positioning may favor quality growth with durable cash flows, complemented by selective cyclicals linked to tangible AI infrastructure and quality small caps that could potentially benefit from policy normalization. Risks include sticky services inflation, labor market deterioration and renewed supply-chain disruptions, while catalysts, such as January consumer-price inflation, Fed communications and fourth-quarter earnings could shape sentiment. In short, we believe the environment supports a disciplined allocation framework that balances the potential upside from policy easing and earnings resilience against valuation constraints and geopolitical volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In our view, small-cap equities may be increasingly attractive in 2026, supported by a convergence of macro, policy and earnings momentum. First, anticipated Fed rate cuts in 2026 could benefit small caps, which tend to be more sensitive to lower borrowing costs. Second, valuations remain discounted; Bank of America projects S&amp;P SmallCap 600 earnings-per-share growth of approximately 19% for 2026, above the broader S&amp;P 500, suggesting favorable entry points. Third, cyclical tailwinds like reshoring, AI-driven capital investment, rising merger-and-acquisition activity and signs of a prospective initial-public-offering rebound may offer additional earnings catalysts. We broadly expect small-cap leadership to extend into 2026 as funds rotate out of overvalued mega caps into this historically overlooked segment. Overall, the combination of improving macroeconomics, lower valuations and accelerating earnings momentum suggests a supportive setup for US small caps, with scope for continued recovery and relative outperformance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 2026 outlook for international markets is supported by attractive valuations, policy accommodation in select regions and strengthening macro data. The European Central Bank's neutral-to-accommodative stance, coupled with fiscal initiatives that are boosting credit growth and industrial activity, supports consensus expectations for approximately 15% earnings-per-share growth in 2026. Meanwhile, Asia may benefit from robust export demand, AI-driven semiconductor momentum and targeted stimulus in China to stabilize property and manufacturing sectors. Regional growth forecasts range from 3.4% to 4.6%. Both regions may offer compelling opportunities in cyclicals, financials and infrastructure-linked sectors, with potential dividend yields and valuation discounts versus US equities adding support. Together, Europe and Asia offer diversified exposure amid a rotation toward broader leadership and structural growth themes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">References</h4> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Performance of individual stock evaluated is based on total effect.

At the same time, we anticipate a gradual deceleration in relative growth over the years, from the current 3%–4% y/y to 2% by the end of the decade. HubSpot has struggled to add more than ~10,000 customers per quarter. This pace has remained steady for recent quarters and will likely persist going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48493874-17721951790863261_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1336\" data-height=\"452\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48493874-17721951790863261_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"HubSpot ARPU forecast\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"217\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48493874-17721951790863261_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48493874-17721951790863261_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48493874-17721951790863261_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48493874-17721951790863261_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>Company Data, Invest<span> Heroes Calculations</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We are also tracking the performance of the ARPU metric (we compute it as subscription revenue divided by the number of customers). ARPU growth accelerated in 3Q, showing a beta of &gt;1x relative to inflation for the first time since 2022. This beta reached 1.07x in 3Q and climbed to 1.2x in 4Q, meaning average revenue per user is now rising faster than inflation. This is a signal that HubSpot is regaining pricing power and improving the revenue retention rate -a trend we view as positive. We expect the beta to remain at these levels moving forward, so the ARPU will grow with 1.2x beta to inflation. We believe U.S. inflation will slow down from the current 2.7% to 2% in the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48493874-17721954556607366_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1664\" data-height=\"563\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48493874-17721954556607366_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Hubspot ARPU forecast\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"217\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48493874-17721954556607366_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48493874-17721954556607366_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48493874-17721954556607366_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48493874-17721954556607366_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>Company Data, Invest<span> Heroes calculations</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the abovementioned, we expect HubSpot to earn a revenue of $3.8 bln (+20% y/y) in 2026, and $4.4 bln (+17% y/y) in 2027.

We calculate our price target based on the projected 2030 EBITDA and a target EV/EBITDA multiple of 23.2x, applying a 13% discount rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We derived the target EV/EBITDA multiple using average long-term multiples at such software-industry companies as Salesforce, Adobe, ServiceNow, and others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Explanation of discount rate: </strong><span>We</span> <span>use</span> <span>EBITDA</span> <span>for</span> <span>2030</span> to <span>evaluate</span> <span>HubSpot</span> <span>shares</span> <span>(</span>the <span>moment</span> <span>when</span><span>,</span> <span>according</span> to <span>our</span> <span>expectations</span><span>,</span> the <span>company</span> will <span>reach</span> <span>the</span> <span>industry</span> <span>average</span> in terms <span>of</span> <span>operating</span> <span>expenses</span><span>)</span><span>.</span> <span>That</span> <span>is</span>, the <span>target</span> <span>price</span> of <span>$</span><span>839</span> <span>is</span> our <span>expected</span> <span>fair</span> <span>share</span> <span>price</span> <span>by</span> <span>2030</span><span>.</span> <span>This</span> <span>means</span> <span>that</span> <span>from</span> the <span>point</span> of <span>view</span> <span>of</span> the <span>time</span> <span>value</span> of <span>cash</span> <span>flows</span>, in order <span>to</span> <span>get</span> the <span>target</span> <span>price</span> <span>over</span> <span>the</span> <span>next</span> <span>12</span> <span>months</span>, <span>we</span> <span>need</span> <span>to</span> discount <span>this</span> <span>value</span><span>.</span> <span>To</span> do <span>this</span>, <span>we</span> <span>use</span> a <span>13</span><span>%</span> <span>rate</span><span>,</span> <span>which</span> <span>corresponds</span> to the average <span>annual</span> <span>growth</span> of the <span>S</span><span>&amp;</span><span>P</span> <span>500</span> <span>index</span> <span>over</span> the <span>past</span> <span>10</span> <span>years</span><span>.</span> In <span>other</span> <span>words</span><span>,</span> <span>using</span> this <span>discount</span> <span>rate</span> <span>allows</span> you to <span>understand</span> whether it is better <span>to</span> <span>invest</span> <span>in</span> a <span>particular</span> <span>company</span> in <span>terms</span> <span>of</span> <span>expected</span> <span>return</span> <span>or</span> whether it is <span>better</span> to <span>invest</span> in the index<span>.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After a period of cooling share prices, HubSpot looks attractive from a valuation standpoint for the first time in a long while. We believe HubSpot combines durable top-line growth, improving operating leverage, and a valuation that no longer reflects its long-term potential. While a sharper-than-expected slowdown in revenue remains the key risk, the current setup offers an attractive risk/reward profile for long-term investors.</p>",
