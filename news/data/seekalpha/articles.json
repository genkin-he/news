There will be a news story that everyone is talking about as something so important to the markets. Then, a few months later, it just disappears.</p> <p>Does<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> anyone remember First Brands? We haven't seen anybody talk about it for months, but back in October 2025, First Brands was the excuse for the market to sell-off for credit risk investments. In particular, \"private credit\" was blamed, and investments like BDCs, private equity, and alternative asset managers sold off significantly. Nevermind that the debt was mostly owned and originated by banks, and private credit had little to do with it – that storyline has disappeared.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now the market has focused on a new fear: AI and software. The current theory is that software companies aren't going to pay their loans because AI is going to disrupt their business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Certainly, AI is going to \"disrupt\" many businesses in a similar manner that the Internet disrupted many businesses. That's technological innovation, and companies will adapt their business models.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">No doubt some businesses might struggle with innovating and finding their path to provide value in a new world. That's life. Those who are lending first-lien senior secured loans to them, generally aren't the ones who end up feeling that risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When the market is fearful, it's time to go shopping for opportunities. Let's take a look at a few opportunities the market is giving us.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pick #1: ARCC – Yield 10%</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Ares Capital Corporation</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARCC\" title=\"Ares Capital\">ARCC</a>) is one of our favorite buy-and-hold \"forever\" stocks. It is a premium BDC that focuses on the upper-middle market. It is an investment that frequently trades at a premium to NAV, but has recently started trading at a discount to its last reported NAV of $19.94.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What has changed? Well, nothing. <strong>ARCC</strong> is doing the same thing it has always done. Credit quality remains consistent with non-accruals at 1.8% of amortized cost and 1.2% of fair value: <em><a href=\"https://ir-api.eqs.com/media/document/961648ac-d93d-400a-82fe-b11eb08b4390/assets/ARCC_Q4-2025_Earnings_Presentation_CLEAN.pdf?disposition=inline\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener\">Source</a> </em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-1770222266167449_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"298\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-1770222266167449_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-1770222266167449_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-1770222266167449_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-1770222266167449_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ARCC Q4 2025 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ARCC's leverage remains low relative to their historical averages, and well within management's target range:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-17702216721650317_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Table\" width=\"640\" height=\"253\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-17702216721650317_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-17702216721650317_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-17702216721650317_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/16392-17702216721650317_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ARCC Q4 2025 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ARCC is doing the same thing that it has been doing for the past +20 years. One thing that has changed recently is investor sentiment. Investor sentiment is fickle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ARCC does lend to software companies. They account for 24% of ARCC's portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/16392-17716486734866388.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"573\" height=\"728\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/16392-17716486734866388.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/16392-17716486734866388.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/16392-17716486734866388.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ARCC Q4 2025 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This shouldn't be a surprise because software and services make up a very large portion of the U.S. economy, and lenders are going to lend to the businesses that make up most of the economy. ARCC's focus is on businesses that are in specialized niches with a fairly large moat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, one of its top 10 largest investments is in <a href=\"https://www.symplr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">Symplr</a>, a company that specializes in providing enterprise-level software solutions to healthcare companies. For a healthcare system to change their software is a major and expensive step. The hard part isn't creating the software, it's in creating and maintaining the customer relationships. Even though it's one of the largest holdings in ARCC's portfolio, Symplr accounts for 1.2% of the portfolio. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ARCC lends to over 600 companies. They are highly diversified and there will always be some of their investments that are struggling. That was true in 2005, 2008, 2015, 2020, and today. The business model doesn't rely on every sector and every borrower being in great shape all the time. ARCC lends money, underwrites the collateral, and makes loans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's why, after over 20 years and $70 billion of closed investments, ARCC's annual realized net loss rate is insignificant. <em><a href=\"https://ir-api.eqs.com/media/document/cd7a0000-da1f-49fa-8545-766897f2408b/assets/Q3-25_ARCC_Tearsheet_vF.pdf?disposition=inline\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">Source</a> </em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/21/16392-17716775137755632.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"437\" height=\"368\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/21/16392-17716775137755632.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/21/16392-17716775137755632.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ARCC Q4 2025 Tear Sheet</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So when ARCC is trading below book value, we are enthusiastic buyers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pick #2: OBDC – Yield 12.6%</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Blue Owl Capital Corporation</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OBDC\" title=\"Blue Owl Capital Corporation\">OBDC</a>) is a BDC that is managed by Blue Owl Capital Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OWL\" title=\"Blue Owl Capital Inc.\">OWL</a>). Over the past six months, we've seen the similarity in names cause quite a bit of volatility for <strong>OBDC</strong>. OWL has been garnering headlines for its investments in data centers and data center debt. Deals that have nothing to do with OBDC, but every negative headline about how \"risky\" these investments are seems to have an impact on OBDC's share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then, OWL attempted to merge a non-traded BDC with OBDC. The market threw a tantrum, and the deal was called off as the decline in OBDC's share price made it unpalatable. Many questioned the value of the assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, OWL just proved the value, selling $1.4 billion across three of its funds: OBDC, OTIC, and OBDC II, the non-traded fund. The loans are being sold at 99.8% of par value to pensions and insurance companies. The batch of loans includes a 13% allocation to \"software and services\" – the favorite sector for bears to be bashing these days. (OBDC's allocation to the sector was 11%)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, OWL just proved that their portfolio is worth well more than the market is currently pricing in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OBDC reported earnings with adjusted NII of $0.36 and book value at $14.81, generally in line with Q3: <em><a href=\"https://www.blueowlcapitalcorporation.com/_assets/_3a451672f8d635b71a9c090c3c6110b1/blueowlcapitalcorporation/db/2246/28360/earnings_presentation/Q4%272025+OBDC+Earnings+Presentation_vF.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Source</a></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714710437119172_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714710437119172_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714710437119172_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714710437119172_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714710437119172_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>OBDC Q4 2025 Supplement</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note that this does not reflect the sale of assets discussed above. That sale occurred on February 12th, 2026 and will be reflected in Q1 earnings. That's likely why OBDC is paying a dividend of $0.37 for another quarter, even though that is slightly more than earnings were in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management took advantage of the discount to NAV that OBDC has been trading at by buying back $148 million in stock in November/December 2025. They also announced a buyback program to buy up to another $300 million in 2026. These buybacks were at a price averaging 86% of NAV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This slightly offset the credit-related markdowns of $0.14 in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714711199758909_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"352\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714711199758909_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714711199758909_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714711199758909_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/16392-17714711199758909_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>OBDC Q4 2025 Supplement</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The overall credit picture of the portfolio remains stable.

OBDC had its credit rating <a href=\"https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Ratings-upgrades-Blue-Owl-Capital-Corporations-senior-unsecured-rating-Rating-Action--PR_518465\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener\">bumped up</a> a notch by Moody's in January to Baa2. While their debt was already investment grade, being a notch higher will be a small benefit when they go to refinance their debt. BDCs borrow at fixed rates and lend at floating rates. Being able to refinance the fixed-rate debt at the lowest possible coupon is a long-term benefit for the company that improves earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When we bought OBDC over 5 years ago, we said we believed that OBDC deserved to trade at a premium to NAV. Then it did trade at a premium for a bit. Today, OBDC is a stronger company by every measure. It has better economies of scale, it has higher earnings, it has a higher credit rating, and it has maintained a similarly low credit loss rate. We believe that OBDC should be trading at 100-110% of NAV, which is $14.81-$16.29. That is fair value, and management just proved it in the most straightforward way possible, by selling assets to prove their worth. Our neighbors in the market are giving us an opportunity to buy it at a big discount.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When the market panics, look for the opportunity it is giving you. BDCs have been off to a rough start in 2026. In part, this is due to the reality that their earnings are normalizing. The rapid increase in interest rates created a windfall that we all knew wasn't going to last forever. BDCs borrow at fixed-rates and lend at floating rates, so higher interest rates produced higher than average spreads for them. That is over. We expect that earnings will continue to drift down and return to their historical averages.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They are still paying a high yield, even without the supplements, and there are opportunities to monetize their portfolio either through selling a portion of their positions like OBDC did, or as portfolio companies have IPOs, are acquired, or have other liquidity events. In periods of low interest rates, we tend to see more of that type of activity.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For those of us looking to buy and hold long-term, these BDCs are trading below book value, and they should be trading at book value or at a premium. We're buying.</p>",

In the last year, Nebius’s shares have already appreciated at a triple-digit rate and gained additional momentum in the last year and a half after Microsoft (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">MSFT</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">)</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4493205-nebius-rockets-after-inking-17_4b-deal-with-microsoft-for-ai-infrastructure\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> announced</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a deal to rent the company’s GPU infrastructure capacity to execute its AI projects.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, Nebius also faces significant challenges that could limit its upside in the future. The company has a capital-intensive business model that requires it to spend the available resources to build new data centers to meet the growing demand for its services. More importantly, since the business is unprofitable while the FCF is negative, Nebius needs to constantly access the capital markets to raise additional funds, which has already increased its debt load. If the hyperscalers decide to scale down their AI expenses or the macro environment worsens, there’s a risk that Nebius’s growth rate will decelerate. As such, we can’t recommend buying or holding the company’s shares right now and rate Nebius as a <em>sell</em>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Challenges That Nebius Faces Are Significant</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nebius specializes in building large-scale GPU clusters, which it later rents to other companies that are interested in using them to execute their AI projects. With the rise of generative AI, the demand for such services has skyrocketed, and it’s not a surprise that in<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4551025-nebius-group-reports-q4-results\"> Q4</a>, Nebius’s revenues increased by an impressive 546.9% Y/Y to $227.7 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the future, Nebius could now expect to generate over $3 billion in revenues annually in the next five years from the Microsoft deal alone. There are also<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4501230-microsofts-nebius-deal-to-provide-computing-power-to-internal-teams-to-ease-ai-crunch\"> reports</a> that under the deal, Microsoft would get access to over 100,000 GB300 chips that are owned by Nebius and will use them for its AI workloads. A similar<a href=\"https://nebius.com/blog/posts/digest-november-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\"> deal</a> that’s worth around $3 billion was signed with Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) a few months ago. While this ensures that Nebius will be able to significantly improve its top-line performance in years to come, there are nevertheless major risks with its business model that make investing in the company an extremely risky endeavor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First of all, by signing such deals, Nebius will take most of the risks associated with expanding the AI infrastructure. The deal gives Microsoft and Meta<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-02/microsoft-neocloud-deals-a-strategy-for-ai-supply-crunch\" rel=\"nofollow\"> financial flexibility</a> as they could pay for access to the computing power when there’s an increase in demand for its AI projects, and also not pay an enormous cost for building and maintaining a data center when the demand has fallen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, Nebius risks being left holding outdated GPUs that are quickly depreciating as more powerful chips are introduced. In 2024, following the success of its GPUs from the Hopper series, Nvidia said that it plans to release new AI accelerators each year. Last year, we already saw the ramp-up in production of its GPUs from the Blackwell series, and the company<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/25/first-look-at-nvidias-ai-system-vera-rubin-and-how-it-beats-blackwell.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> expects</a> to release accelerators from the Rubin series later in 2026. This could suggest that as more powerful chips are introduced, Nebius would be required to constantly spend resources on new GPUs to expand its data center footprint and remain competitive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We already see this happening since Nebius’s CapEx is expected to be in the range of $16 billion to $20 billion, an increase from $4.07 billion in 2025. The problem is that the company’s business is unprofitable and is expected to lose money in the following years. As such, Nebius is expected to access the capital markets for a while to expand its AI infrastructure. In June, it already raised $1 billion through the issuance of convertible notes. Then, in September, it began to raise an additional $3.75 billion through the issuance of new notes and shares. The problem with this is that it increases the company’s debt load and will likely dilute its existing shareholders. In recent quarters, Nebius’s total debt has already greatly increased. Considering that Nebius is likely to remain unprofitable, while its CapEx increases and the FCF remains negative, the company will likely continue to access the capital markets to scale its business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a big red flag for us, since there’s no guarantee that after all this spending, Nebius will be able to reach profitability and become FCF positive in the foreseeable future to avoid issuing new debt and shares. Some reports from last year indicate that even Oracle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>) struggles with improving the margins of its business that rents Nvidia’s chips and even loses money on rentals in some cases. In addition, with AI bubble fears on the rise, there’s a risk that if the demand for large-scale GPU clusters decreases, then Nebius could be left with lots of depreciating GPUs and a limited ability to turn things around and become profitable. That’s why we find it hard to justify a long position in Nebius, especially considering that the challenges that the company faces are on the rise, while its stock already trades at<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NBIS/valuation/metrics\"> exuberant multiples</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Real Value of Nebius</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering all the issues described above, we decided to create a valuation model and figure out the real value of Nebius in the current environment. In the model, our forecast period includes the next five years, and the perpetual growth rate that we use is 3%, which is close to the<a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/valuation/what-is-terminal-growth-rate/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> historical</a> inflation and GDP growth rate. The cash and debt<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NBIS/balance-sheet\"> numbers</a> have been taken from the recent earnings report.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The discount rate that we use is 10.12%. We figured it out by calculating the cost of debt and the cost of equity of Nebius. When calculating the cost of equity, we used the<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NBIS/income-statement\"> TTM</a> numbers for the interest expense and the total debt numbers from the latest earnings report. For the cost of equity, we used a<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y\"> risk-free rate</a> of 4%, a<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NBIS/peers/comparison\"> beta</a> of 2.05, and the<a href=\"https://www.officialdata.org/us/stocks/s-p-500/1950?amount=100&amp;endYear=2025\" rel=\"nofollow\"> market return rate</a> of 7.84%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177164371755_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1377\" data-height=\"385\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177164371755_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Valuation model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"179\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177164371755_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177164371755_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177164371755_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177164371755_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Valuation model <span>(Bears of Wall Street)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to sales estimates, we expect the company to continue to grow significantly in the years to come. The deal with Microsoft under the maximum extension alone would be able to generate around $3.8 billion annually, while the deal with Meta should yield around $600 million annually in the next five years. The management even stated in the latest earnings call that they’re on track to reach around $7 billion to $9 billion in annualized run-rate revenue, so the aggressive growth rate is expected. We reflected this in the model, and we also assume a continuous double-digit growth rate in all the other years, since in the same call, the management stated that the projects that they plan to implement this year could lay the foundation for the hyper growth in 2027 and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the bottom-line performance, things don’t look as good. The expectations right now are that Nebius will remain unprofitable in the upcoming years. Morgan Stanley expects the AI spending to deliver returns only by 2028. Considering this, we assume in the model that Nebius’s EBIT will become positive only in 2028, while in 2026, it’s going to be only slightly better in comparison to its<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NBIS/profitability\"> TTM margin</a>. The tax rate in our model is 15%, which is the rate we mostly use when valuing<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/bears-of-wall-street/analysis\"> other companies</a> from the AI field.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the depreciation &amp; amortization, it has been relatively high in the past, and we assume that that remains to be the case in the future. This is because the AI accelerators that Nebius purchases<a href=\"https://cernocapital.com/accounting-for-ai-financial-accounting-issues-and-capital-deployment-in-the-hyperscaler-landscape\" rel=\"nofollow\"> depreciate</a> fairly quickly due to the constant release of more powerful chips, which leads to a drop in the value of older chips.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to the capital expenditures, during the latest conference call, the management said that they<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869424-nebius-group-n-v-nbis-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\"> expect</a> the spending this year to be in the range of $16 billion to $20 billion. We reflected this in the model. At the same time, we also expect a major increase in spending in the following years. Let’s not forget that Nebius’s management in the same call also said that they expect to achieve 800 megawatts to 1 gigawatts of connected power by around year-end, and achieve over 3 gigawatts of contracted power by the end of 2026. Since it was also noted that the acceleration of the data center build-out will continue in 2027 and beyond, we could expect a major expansion of computing capacity that would require lots of capital spending in the future. That’s why we believe that the major increase in CapEx assumptions in the next few years is more than justified.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to the assumptions for the change in net working capital, they are not that far from the company’s historical performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Under all of those assumptions, our model shows that the enterprise value of Nebius is $18.69 billion, while its equity value is $17.48 billion. That translates to an intrinsic value of $69.08 per share, below the current market price by 30.09% at the time of this writing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177178394756_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2108\" data-height=\"748\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177178394756_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Valuation model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"227\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177178394756_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177178394756_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177178394756_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48206420-17722177178394756_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Valuation model <span>(Bears of Wall Street)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks To Our Bearish Thesis</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nebius’s stock could nevertheless appreciate further along with the rest of the market if the macro environment improves. The latest<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4551876-headline-cpi-inflation-rises-less-than-expected-in-january-core-cpi-rises-in-line\"> CPI</a> numbers suggest that inflation is not reaccelerating, which makes it possible for the Federal Reserve to continue to cut interest rates in the following quarters as macro risks subside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, the improving macro environment could prompt hyperscalers to continue to increase their spending on AI infrastructure to another record level, which would be beneficial to neocloud providers like Nebius.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While it’s possible that Nebius will continue to trade at the excessive multiples and its share price appreciates further, especially if another major deal is announced, we find it hard to justify a long position right now. Due to the excessive capital spending, the company is unlikely to generate any positive FCF in the next few years, and it will likely be required to once again raise additional capital that will increase its debt load even more. At the same time, at the current market price, Nebius doesn’t offer any decent margin of safety, while the risks that the business faces are significant. That is why we decided to rate Nebius as a <em>sell</em>.</p>",

Over the last two hours, it's safe to say that all of those diplomatic efforts over many years of \"strategic patience\" have gone up in flames.

Why? Indeed, if you think about it, the Israeli attack on Tehran, particularly given its proximity to sensitive areas of power (Khamenei's office and residence), represents a change because a \"red line\" that had existed for a long time has been crossed.

Iran is not an insignificant player in terms of supplying oil to the world. Iran is the 4th largest oil-producing country within OPEC and supplies approximately 11-12% of all OPEC oil production, which equates to about 3.3 million bbl/day of oil supply. Any disruption to the flow of oil from Iran (whether due to more stringent sanctions or damage to its infrastructure) would immediately shrink the size of the global oil market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772284063341022_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1340\" data-height=\"934\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772284063341022_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bloomberg\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"446\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772284063341022_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772284063341022_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772284063341022_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772284063341022_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The major issue, however, is a logistics issue</strong>.

This therefore means that if no complete blockage occurs, it will only take creating additional risk factors (mines, drones, GPS interference, etc.) or increasing the level of military tension in the area to slow the flow of ships and quickly increase both shipping and insurance costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think OPEC+, on its own, can’t solve the issue of price increases because if Saudi Arabia were to pump more oil, there are already alternative pipelines out of the Gulf, but they’re nowhere near as large as those through the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait is so narrow that, while it’s possible to create some alternatives, it will be difficult to get enough oil out of the Gulf to replace the volume going through the Strait each day. As such, if the Strait becomes an operational constraint, the market may face a sudden supply deficit (a deficiency) that no amount of rapid production increases from OPEC+ can quickly make up for; thus, the risk to the price of oil is much greater now than would initially appear.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold, Equities, and the King Dollar</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The word of the day on Monday will probably be risk-off because during times of conflict or instability, the markets are always seeking shelter from the storm, so to speak.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dollar</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I start by looking at the Dollar (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DXY\" title=\"US Dollar Index\">DXY</a></span>). Although the U.S.A. is actively involved in this scenario, based upon historical precedent, the USD continues to be viewed as the safe-haven currency when the markets are stressed. It is the currency of choice for paying for oil and raw materials and for most other global transactions. Therefore, in the short term, I think we should anticipate a stronger dollar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285172258975_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"926\" data-height=\"526\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285172258975_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bloomberg\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"364\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285172258975_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285172258975_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285172258975_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285172258975_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAUUSD:CUR\">XAUUSD</a>) should act like it usually does during a period of chaos and provide investors with some protection from the uncertainties that are currently affecting the market. The fact that gold hit an all-time price before the most recent tensions indicates that the markets have already begun to account for this type of tension. If the instability continues, I think you may see additional increases in the price of gold. However, due to the large degree of volatility that is associated with the type of rapid increase in the price of gold, I think it would be prudent to use caution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285195626483_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2010\" data-height=\"1239\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285195626483_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bloomberg\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"395\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285195626483_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285195626483_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285195626483_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-1772285195626483_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Equities</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most key component is the sensitivity of stocks over the short term, i.e., an extremely negative opening price resulting from uncertainty could cause investors to flee to safe havens.

However, the scope of the operation appears to extend beyond that of a surgical attack. It appears as if the mission is a much broader effort, as opposed to a limited engagement to eliminate the Iranian capability for a nuclear weapons program, the missile delivery systems, and the naval capabilities. The objective of this operation is more akin to an attempt to create regime change rather than an operation that is limited in its objectives. As we have seen in <strong>Iraq</strong>, <strong>Afghanistan</strong>, and <strong>Libya</strong>, we should remember that having air superiority is rarely sufficient to bring down an established government.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-17722857759233696_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1515\" data-height=\"777\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-17722857759233696_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bloomberg\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"328\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-17722857759233696_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-17722857759233696_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-17722857759233696_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55096224-17722857759233696_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Iran may fall into a \"<strong>survival mode</strong>\" that could last for months or even years, based upon how long it takes for the current Iranian Government to fall. The most vulnerable and riskiest chokepoint in the global economy would likely be the Strait of Hormuz, because Iran has about <strong>90 million residents</strong> and an internally fractured opposition movement. Thus, a long-term situation of turmoil is by no means out of the question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think, among the other indicators I have mentioned, there is also the possibility that the global financial markets will experience a strong downturn followed by a quick rebound from that downturn as a result of an elimination of the current political uncertainties. If instead, however, the \"<strong>survival-and-chaos</strong>\" scenario prevails with sustained tension surrounding Hormuz, the most relevant macroeconomic risk factors for the global economy will be pressure on oil prices, potential inflationary pressures, and a lower rate of economic growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We are only at the end of this weekend, and with all of these types of scenarios, it’s usually better to wait than anticipate. The first real read on Monday will come from the closing numbers. If support breaks down and does so significantly, then liquidity will once again be the most important commodity.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>We need to continue to monitor the situation.</strong></p>",

Drastic Headcount Reduction</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Much of XYZ's tailwinds may be attributed to the management's drastic reduction in their <a href=\"https://s29.q4cdn.com/628966176/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-2025-Shareholder-Letter_Block.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">headcounts by -40%</a> along with the raised FY2026 gross profit/operating income guidance, with it signaling their confidence in delivering the accelerated, profitable growth trends through a notably leaner operation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The headcount reduction builds upon the ongoing reduction to:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/173595682\">10,205 employees in FY2025</a> (-10.2% YoY),</li> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/9585158\">11,372 employees in FY2024</a> (-12.4% YoY),</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">after the multi-year headcount expansion at</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/8346566\">12,985 employees in FY2023</a> (+4.4% YoY),</li> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/7267377\">12,428 employees in FY2022</a> (+45.8% YoY),</li> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/6249016\">8,521 employees in FY2021</a> (+55.5% YoY),</li> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/5386965\">5,477 employees in FY2020</a> (+42.8% YoY), and</li> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/4846124\">3,835 employees in FY2019</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/4376004\">+14.5% YoY</a>).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on the ongoing headcount expansion at a 6Y CAGR of +17.7% against their revenue growth at +31.3% over the same time period, it may appear that XYZ's planned headcount reduction may have been overly done indeed, given the growing headcounts' notable contribution to their top-line growth thus far.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is especially true when comparing XYZ's revenue per employee metric at $2.37M in FY2025 (+11.7% YoY) against its direct fintech peers, including:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Neo bank/investment - SoFi Technologies, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SOFI\" title=\"SoFi Technologies, Inc.\">SOFI</a>) at $591K in FY2025 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/159729837\">FY2025 revenues of $3.61B</a> and 6,100 employees),</li> <li>AI lending platform - Upstart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPST\" title=\"Upstart Holdings, Inc.\">UPST</a>) at $740K in FY2025 (based on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/151270725\">FY2025 revenues of $1.04B</a> and 1,405 employees),</li> <li>Neo bank - LendingClub Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LC\" title=\"LendingClub Corporation\">LC</a>) at $929K (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/155409111\">FY2025 revenues of $998.84M</a> and 1,075 employees),</li> <li>PSP/P2P/BNPL - PayPal Holdings, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PYPL\" title=\"PayPal Holdings, Inc.\">PYPL</a>) at $1.39M (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/140936153\">FY2025 revenues of $33.17B</a> and 23,800 employees), and</li> <li>BNPL - Affirm Holdings, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AFRM\" title=\"Affirm Holdings, Inc.\">AFRM</a>) at $1.45M in FY2025 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/10358654\">FY2025 revenues of $3.22B</a> and 2,206 employees),</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">with it apparent that XYZ's operations remain rather efficient thus far, albeit still a distance away from the supposed market leader in the financial market, <a href=\"https://www.ondeck.com/resources/revenue-per-employee-ranking\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">StoneX at $23.76M of revenue per employee</a> in early 2025, as reported by Ondeck in November 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, given the drastic headcount reduction of -40%, it goes without saying that XYZ is likely to report a notably higher metric at an estimated FY2026 sum of $4.45M per employee (+87.7% YoY), based on the consensus FY2026 revenue estimates of $26.75B (+10.5% YoY) and ~6,000 employees after reduction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that the revenue per employee metric \"is an important ratio that roughly measures how much money each <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenueperemployee.asp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">employee generates for the company</a>,\" it goes without saying that the management appears determined to deliver their ambitious 2028 growth targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If anything, a similar cadence has been observed in Verizon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ\" title=\"Verizon Communications Inc.\">VZ</a>), as the new CEO also touts how “cost reductions will be<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834657-verizon-communications-inc-vz-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\"> a way of life</a> for us here” and the strategy is expected to fund their “significant investment” towards reclaiming their market leadership in the telecom segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These developments are unsurprising indeed, as observed in the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/u-s-companies-are-still-slashing-jobs-to-reverse-pandemic-hiring-boom-abf1b94e\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">market-wide layoffs</a> post-COVID-19 pandemic, significantly aided by the <a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-adoption-accelerates-survey-find\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">productivity gains</a> during the ongoing AI boom.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. Raised FY2026 Guidance</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is also important to note that XYZ has already raised their FY2026 guidance, with the gross profit guidance of $12.2B (+18% YoY) and the adj. operating income guidance of $3.2B (+53.8% YoY), notably building upon the FY2025 levels of $10.36B (+17% YoY) and $2.08B (<a href=\"https://s29.q4cdn.com/628966176/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/Shareholder-Letter_Block-4Q24pdf.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">+29.1% YoY</a>), respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming that the fintech is able to sustain these growth rates, it is not overly aggressive to assume that they may also eventually achieve their 2028 growth targets previously offered in the 2025 Investors Day, with the projected:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>gross profit growth to <a href=\"https://block.xyz/documents/block-investor-day-2025-full-presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">$15.8B in FY2028</a>, expanding at a 3Y CAGR of +15.1%, and</li> <li>adj operating income growth to $4.6B in FY2028, expanding at a 3Y CAGR of +30.2%,</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">significantly aided by the likely to be reduced operating expenses from the drastic headcount reduction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Readers must also note the accretive impact from XYZ's ongoing share repurchases on its adj. EPS growth to $0.65 in FQ4<span></span> '25 (+38.2% YoY), thanks to -3.5% of its float already retired over the LTM and the richer adj. net income margins of 6.4% in FQ4<span></span> '25 (+1.4 points YoY).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722408609937572_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2491\" data-height=\"768\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722408609937572_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"XYZ Valuations\" width=\"640\" height=\"197\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"197\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722408609937572_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722408609937572_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722408609937572_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722408609937572_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">XYZ Valuations <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These reasons are also why I am of the opinion that XYZ still looks compelling at my estimated FY2026 P/E non-GAAP valuations of 17.46x, based on the current stock prices of $63.94 and the fintech's FY2026 adj EPS guidance of $3.66 (+54.4% YoY).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is especially since the management still expects to deliver adjusted EPS of $5.50 in FY2028, expanding at a 3Y CAGR of +32.3%, with the stock still cheap at my estimated 3Y PEG non-GAAP ratio of 0.54x against the 5Y mean of 2.28x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When comparing against the sector median of 1.01x and its direct fintech peers, including:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>UPST at 3Y PEG non-GAAP ratio of 0.42x (using the same methodology),</li> <li>AFRM at 0.44x,</li> <li>SOFI at 0.81x,</li> <li>LC at 0.21x, and</li> <li>PYPL at 1.27x,</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">it is apparent that XYZ has remained compellingly valued as a fintech stock for so long that the management is able to leverage their \"intelligence tools\" and \"significantly smaller team\" to successfully execute their 2028 growth target.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is especially since XYZ still reports a relatively decent balance sheet health at a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.06x in FY2025, compared to some of its peers, including AFRM at 1.50x, SOFI at -2.96x (more cash than debt), and PYPL at 0.06x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These underscore XYZ's ability to incrementally invest in their growth initiatives while directing much of their free cash flow generation of $2.42B (+17.4% YoY) towards future share retirement, with $5.3B still remaining in authorization.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. Return To Growth</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Much of XYZ's ability to deliver the aggressive 2028 targets is linked to their determination to return to growth, through:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>the expanded merchant network to drive higher user acquisition trends,</li> <li>the expanded lending and banking products to drive higher user engagement and cross-selling trends,</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">all of which are expected to drive improved monetization trends and higher Gross Payment Volumes [GPV] across both Cash App and Square.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The same has been observed in Cash App's Monthly Transacting Active growth to 59M in FQ4<span></span> '25 (+2M YoY) and Primary Banking Actives to 9.3M (+1.7M YoY), along with the growing Inflows Per Transacting Active at $1.41K (+11.9% YoY), as \"more customers bring their paychecks into Cash App.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The latter is important indeed, since \"these customers have generated nearly 10x the gross profit of peer-to-peer only actives,\" with it also triggering higher retention trends and spending volumes through the Cash App Card.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thanks to the tailwinds from the prior Fed rate cuts in late 2025, the fintech has also reported growing \"consumer lending origination volume by 50% year-over-year in 2025, while sustaining strong margins and healthy risk loss performance,\" as similarly reported by other lenders/BNPL players in the recent Q4<span></span> '25 earnings season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is on top of XYZ Square's growing GPV by +10% YoY, as their international expansion drives accelerated GPV growth by +25% YoY compared to the US at +7% YoY, aided by their expansion into the mid-market seller channels (&gt;$500K in annualized GPV).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Most importantly, despite the growth initiatives and the intensified R&amp;D efforts, the fintech has been able to report a notable expansion in their adjusted operating margins to 20% in FQ4<span></span> '25 (+3 points YoY) and to 20% in FY2025 as well (+2 points YoY), with it lending credence to their increasingly efficient operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The excellent Return On Investment [ROI] on their growth initiatives may also be why the market has rewarded the XYZ stock with the outsized double-digit rally post-FQ4<span></span> '25 earnings call, with the fintech seemingly on track to reverse their previously decelerating growth profile in FY2024/FY2025 while delivering the ambitious 2028 growth targets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>XYZ Remains A Great Buy Upon A Correction</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722407941221094_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1814\" data-height=\"887\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722407941221094_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"XYZ 8Y Stock Price\" width=\"640\" height=\"313\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"313\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722407941221094_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722407941221094_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722407941221094_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722407941221094_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

While AWS growth continued to rebound, it still lagged growth seen in key competitors. Furthermore, North America sales weakness is concerning moving forward. While profitability looked quite strong for Q4, guidance for 2026 Q1 was soft in my view. Furthermore, with the valuation not particularly low, I would say that there is limited opportunity for investors.

The company generated total sales worth $213.4 billion, and while the growth rate of 14% isn't bad relative to what we have seen in the past few years, the acceleration <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/AMZN-Q3-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">from the previous quarter</a> was quite minimal. Furthermore, in constant currency terms, the sales growth rate was actually unchanged at 12%, and so momentum doesn't seem to be building at this point. Still, Amazon actually <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN/earnings\">beat expectations by $2.15 billion.</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-r paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722225538400953.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Sales Breakdown\" width=\"407\" height=\"426\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"407\" data-height=\"426\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722225538400953.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722225538400953.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Amazon Q4 Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other point of concern is the weakness and underperformance in their North America segment. <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Webslides_Q425.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">As you can see on the right,</a> the North America eCommerce segment is still by far their largest by net sales. In Q4, growth decelerated to 10% from the previous quarter's already quite sluggish 11% increase. Meanwhile, International sales growth accelerated both in reported and constant currency terms. This is clearly a demonstration of the erosion of consumer confidence that has happened in the United States as a result of tariffs and still quite sticky inflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, the company's strategic decision to continue pushing into pharmacy services is one that could help to drive growth in their North America segment moving forward. On Feb 11th, it was reported that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4550489-amazon-pharmacy-to-bring-same-day-delivery-to-4500-cities-in-2026\">Amazon is targeting same-day delivery</a> to 4,500 U.S. cities by the end of CY2026. This boosts Amazon's competitiveness in this space. Next, let's turn to a closer look at their all-important AWS segment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWS Growth Continues To Rebound</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-1772223156031851_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1009\" data-height=\"451\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-1772223156031851_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AWS\" width=\"640\" height=\"286\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"286\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-1772223156031851_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-1772223156031851_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-1772223156031851_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-1772223156031851_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Amazon Q4 Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The focus is, without a doubt, on AWS in this age of AI. There were some promising results in this key segment. For Q4, they reported net sales of $35.579 billion, and that represented growth of 24% YoY. This is a speedup of growth compared to Q3's 20% growth rate, and so there are signs that momentum is starting to pick up. It is not surprising that the cloud market share leader is growing slower than its largest competitors, but the gap in growth versus Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) and Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) may be a little bit unnerving.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In their most recent earnings report, <a href=\"https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/2025q4-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Cloud saw a 48% increase in revenues,</a> while <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2026-q2/press-release-webcast\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft Azure saw 39% growth.</a> Of course, AWS has a larger growth base, but if Amazon continues to lag other hyperscalers over the long run, there is a risk that it will lose its crown in cloud services. That said, they do seem to be making some meaningful moves that will help to drive better performance over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We'll talk about their CapEx a little later, but just a few days ago, Amazon announced that they will <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4555427-amazon-invests-12b-for-data-centers-in-louisiana-to-cater-cloud-ai-workload-demand\">invest $12 billion to build data centers</a> in Louisiana. As Ahmed Farhath of Seeking Alpha writes, \"Louisiana has become a hotbed for AI infrastructure projects due to significant tax benefits, low electricity rates, and a reliable power grid.\" Therefore, it seems that Amazon is making a good strategic decision and investment to boost the presence of AWS. While spending may scare off some investors, at this point, it really does seem that Amazon has to invest heavily in data centers to secure the long run success of AWS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just today (Feb 27th), it was confirmed by OpenAI that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558700-openai-confirms-110b-funding-round-with-50b-from-amazon-and-30b-from-nvidia-softbank\">Amazon would be investing $50 billion</a> into the company. In addition to the investment, it was also announced that OpenAI would deepen its commitment to using AWS. Moving forward, AWS will be \"the exclusive third-party cloud distribution provider for OpenAI Frontier, which enables organizations to build, deploy, and manage teams of AI agents.\" Furthermore, OpenAI will be consuming 2 GW of Trainium capacity. This is a big deal for AWS and for their Trainium chips in particular, as it is a vote of confidence that there is strong demand for Amazon's in-house chips. Moving forward, securing more deals like these will help AWS solidify its lead in cloud services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a whole, I would say that AWS is moving in the right direction. While growth still trails Google Cloud and Azure, they are seeing a good amount of re-acceleration in this key segment. Furthermore, as highlighted above, new data center investments and a deepening relationship with OpenAI are likely to drive AWS' performance in the long run.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability Better Than It Seems</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722251300544424_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"732\" data-height=\"400\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722251300544424_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Profitability\" width=\"640\" height=\"350\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722251300544424_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722251300544424_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722251300544424_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722251300544424_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the EPS growth rate was quite poor, as shown above, profitability is better than it seems. For the bottom line, Amazon reported an EPS of $1.95, just meeting expectations and representing a sluggish growth rate of 5% YoY. However, a steep increase in provision for income taxes was a major factor in these numbers. When looking at the true profitability of Amazon's operations, things weren't bad at all.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For operating income, they saw an 18% increase. This outpaces the top-line growth rate as a sign of good business efficiency. Furthermore, when excluding the three special charges listed in their earnings release, operating margin would have been even better. As a result, I believe profitability is not a major concern at this point.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">CapEx Soars</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722256814178987_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"993\" data-height=\"265\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722256814178987_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CapEx\" width=\"640\" height=\"171\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"171\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722256814178987_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722256814178987_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722256814178987_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722256814178987_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Amazon Q4 Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Above, the TTM numbers are shown for Amazon's cash flows and CapEx. As you can see, while operating cash flows have grown quite healthily, the company's capital spending has exploded. FCFs are clearly on a downtrend, and with the company announcing that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4548340-amazon-targets-200b-in-capital-expenditures-for-aws-and-signals-rapid-ai-driven-growth\">CapEx will be around $200 billion</a> for 2026, investors may have their doubts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, management is probably doing what's right for the company. AWS growth is lagging Azure and Google Cloud, and for them to maintain their CSP crown, they are going to have to spend. Investments in data centers and infrastructure are likely to drive shareholder value over time, but in the meantime, investors are going to have to sit with deteriorating FCFs and perhaps even negative FCFs at some point down the road.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook Is Soft</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For 2026 Q1, Amazon sees net sales growth in the range of 11% to 15%. At the midpoint, they're implying a modest growth slowdown from Q4's 14%. I wasn't overly impressed by the slight acceleration of growth in Q4 from Q3 levels, and so I would have to say that top line guidance for Q1 is a bit soft. Still, this was actually <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4548198-earnings-snapshot-amazon-beats-on-revenue-sees-200b-in-2026-capex\">above consensus expectations. </a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For operating income, they are expecting to see around $19 billion at the midpoint of their guidance range. This implies a growth rate of just 3% YoY. While the company did state that their estimate for operating income includes higher Amazon Leo costs for the scaling of that business, overall profitability may still be a bit shaky moving forward. As a whole, I'm unimpressed with Amazon's near-term outlook even if their strategic decisions and investments are beneficial for the long term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Not That Attractive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_3121cf3b5826a88e2681c78a701207cf.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_3121cf3b5826a88e2681c78a701207cf.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_3121cf3b5826a88e2681c78a701207cf.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_3121cf3b5826a88e2681c78a701207cf.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Amazon's forward P/E ratio has dipped so far in 2026, it is still above Microsoft's and Alphabet's. I believe this shows that Amazon stock is relatively unattractive right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For some context, Microsoft and Alphabet posted company-wide growth rates of 17% and 18%, respectively, in their most recent quarter. This outpaces the growth rate for Amazon. Furthermore, recall that AWS growth lags both Azure and Google Cloud by a large margin. Therefore, while there are obviously business model differences between the companies, Amazon seems to be rather expensive relative to where their fundamentals stand in the grand scheme of things.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, while strategic moves are justified, the near-term outlook is undesirable as per their guidance. In a recent article, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869138-microsoft-stock-buy-amid-software-meltdown-rating-upgrade\">I called Microsoft a strong buy,</a> but Amazon likely only remains a hold at this point.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon stock plunged post-earnings, and it's not that hard to see why. Their largest segment by sales, North America, is underperforming, and despite better AWS momentum, Azure and Google Cloud continue to take the spotlight. While developments like their pharmacy push and their OpenAI deal are positive, guidance shows that the outlook is unfavorable at least for the near term. As stated above, company-wide growth and cloud growth at Amazon trail both Microsoft and Alphabet, yet the valuation is higher. I believe this shows the risk/reward is not where investors want it to be, and so I have decided to maintain my hold rating on Amazon.</p>",

I think it’s safe to say that the slide was driven less by the 2025 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558466-emergent-biosolutions-outlines-720m-760m-2026-revenue-target-as-transformation-plan-advances\">results</a> but more by a major<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> negative reset in 2026 </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558755-emergent-biosolutions-plummets-weak-2026-revenue-guidance-q4-results\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">expectations</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">. Management guided to just $720 to $760 million in 2026 revenue, a range that was far below the roughly $1.0 billion level that analysts had been modelling. Elsewhere, management guided for adjusted EBITDA of $135 to $155 million, down from $205 million in 2025, alongside an expected return to a GAAP net loss. So overall, it didn’t make for great viewing, and the size of the expectations gap, not just the weaker fundamentals, which I’ll get to, is what really hurt the stock price. Now, I think the sheer size of the guidance told us that 2025 profitability was boosted by a pretty favourable mix and cost dynamics that will not repeat any time soon. The competitive pressure on naloxone, combined with the uneven government procurement, should weigh rather heavily on 2026. So overall, with lower revenue on the horizon and a sharp dip in profitability expected, I wouldn't be too bullish on Emergent shares, which now find themselves trading in the $8 range.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722598211696093_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"896\" data-height=\"501\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722598211696093_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722598211696093_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722598211696093_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722598211696093_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722598211696093_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span> Emergent BioSolutions Inc.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emergent showed us a much-improved <a href=\"https://investors.emergentbiosolutions.com/static-files/d6aacde1-b9f8-499a-ad23-6e9176e04e83\" rel=\"nofollow\">FY25</a> financial performance in 2025. We’re starting to see the impact of their multi-year turnaround strategy. Now, despite a steep 29% year-over-year decline in total revenue to $742.9 million, the company actually swung from a net loss of $190.6 million in 2024 to a net income of $52.6 million in 2025. This was, of course, mainly driven by some very aggressive cost controls. We also saw improved manufacturing efficiency and a far richer product mix. Gross margin managed to expand to 45%, up from 26%, while adjusted gross margin rose to 54%. It’s a nice reflection of lower production costs and the reduced restructuring and shutdown expenses. Elsewhere, adjusted EBITDA hit $205.0 million, up about 12% year over year, so it’s clear that profitability gains were not just accounting-driven but also operational. As for cash flow from operations, the company has $170.6 million and a decent reduction in leverage, of which a big chunk came from a voluntary $100 million debt repayment and share repurchases totalling $24.8 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597261428473_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"916\" data-height=\"512\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597261428473_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597261428473_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597261428473_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597261428473_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597261428473_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span> Emergent BioSolutions Inc.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for 4Q25, here’s where we see the real volatility that comes with Emergent’s revenue model. 4Q25 revenue fell about 24% to just $148.7 million, with the company reporting a net loss of $54.6 million. Now, this was mainly due to weaker naloxone sales and the overall timing of U.S. government and international medical countermeasure orders. In terms of naloxone, revenue has dropped 41% since generic competition has been piling on the pricing pressure. Also, smallpox MCM sales declined about 54% due to procurement timing. However, it’s worth mentioning that these declines were partially offset by a hefty 64% jump in anthrax MCM revenue. This goes to show just how important government-driven contract cycles are in quarterly performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722596279198217_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"913\" data-height=\"493\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722596279198217_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"346\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722596279198217_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722596279198217_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722596279198217_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722596279198217_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span> Emergent BioSolutions Inc.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other segment results also show us a lot of divergence, with Commercial Products margins collapsing to 6% in 4Q25, again a result of the pricing pressure. Elsewhere, MCM Products' margins expanded to 44% with the help of some higher-margin products and favourable manufacturing variances. You can see the revenue compressions compared to last year in the chart below. As for guidance, we can expect much lower profitability in 2026, which is another thing investors wouldn’t have been too happy about on the call. Management guided for lower adjusted EBITDA in the range of $135 to $155 million and a return to a GAAP net loss. So that would suggest the 2025 strength benefited from the unusually favourable cost and mix dynamics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597588631678_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"919\" data-height=\"491\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597588631678_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"342\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597588631678_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597588631678_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597588631678_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597588631678_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span> Emergent BioSolutions Inc.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Competition on naloxone</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the big points on the call and also a trend we’ve been seeing in 2025 was the pressure on naloxone. There’s been massive competition and also some unpredictable government buying patterns, which haven’t helped. If we take these together, they would account for a lot of the conservatism in the 2026 guidance. On the competitive side of things, the U.S. naloxone market has shifted quite rapidly since the OTC conversion. There are now multiple low-cost generic and even store-brand versions entering retail channels. Management actually warned that anticipated price adjustments will more than likely offset volume growth in 2026, which is never a good sign. It tells me that whilst unit demand remains rather strong, revenue per dose is falling simply because states, municipalities, and NGOs are prioritising cheaper alternatives. This is mainly why we’re seeing commercial revenue get guided to only flat to slightly up despite broader overdose-response funding trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, what also didn’t help is that government procurement is still highly uneven. You can see in the 2025 results. They benefited from an exceptional $60 million international customer order, but management doesn’t expect it to repeat in 2026. So this made somewhat of a built-in year-over-year headwind. In addition to this, the U.S. government shutdown caused some disruptions in 4Q24. We saw temporary reductions in NARCAN demand since public agencies delayed purchasing decisions. What this showed us is that naloxone volumes can be driven more by budget timing and even administrative processes rather than by end-user need, which we would rather see. We should also stay realistic and understand that naloxone demand is not actually collapsing, but it's the revenue contribution that’s becoming less predictable and lower-margin. Emergent to guide very conservatively on both top line and profitability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">One-time $60 million international MCM order</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think it’s worth touching on the loss of a one-time $60 million international MCM order, since it boosted 2025 results a lot. It also seems it won’t recur anytime soon. That order made up about 8% of FY25 total revenue, and materially helped out with margins and EBITDA. The FY26 revenue is now expected to fall between $720 and $760 million, and even the top end of the range implies that the underlying business is only flat to slightly down. Which I feel is due to stripping out this non-repeat contribution. You see, a large portion of 2025’s growth was actually opportunistic rather than structural, and the absence alone explains most of that year-over-year revenue decline embedded in guidance. It’s also set to contribute to the projected drop in adjusted EBITDA from $205 million in FY25 to $135 to $155 million in 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emergent, after this latest stock sell-off, now seems extremely discounted on a revenue-based <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EBS/valuation/metrics\">valuation</a>, especially given the company’s scale. They hold a market cap of about $583 million against a 2025 revenue figure of $742.9 million. The stock now trades at just 0.76x trailing sales and about 0.72x forward sales, which is a pretty steep discount to the healthcare sector median, nearing 3.7x. I find this particularly notable since they have specialised government-backed biodefense contracts and a gross margin profile that expanded to 45% in 2025. On an enterprise value basis, they trade at about 1.2x EV to sales and 4.3x EV to EBITDA, versus sector norms closer to 3.7x and 14x, respectively. So that would imply the market is assigning a hefty discount to Emergent’s durability of earnings and future revenue visibility, rather than its current operating performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So the way I see this is, despite appearing as optically cheap, the post-earnings valuation of Emergent now reflects a business that just reset its earnings power meaningfully lower. Not what investors would have wanted, but with that sharp reduction in 2026 revenue/EBITDA guidance, it has reframed 2025 as a peak year driven. The peak was driven by those one-off orders and unusually favourable cost dynamics rather than a sustainable run rate, which we would have preferred. So, to me, that means the market is no longer valuing Emergent on last year’s profitability but now on a structurally weaker forward profile. It also means naloxone pricing pressure, and that somewhat lumpy government procurement makes cash flows less predictable. If you look at it this way, the discount in the share price seems to be more like compensation for elevated uncertainty, especially around the durability of margins and future revenue visibility.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead<strong> </strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FY25 now looks more like a profitability high-water mark rather than a new baseline. Adjusted EBITDA hit $205 million last year, and what helped was that aggressive $140 million reduction in operating expenses. We also saw a 900 basis-point expansion in gross margin, but despite all this, management’s FY26 outlook of $135 to $155 million in EBITDA implies that most of those easily achievable cost savings have already been realised. So we can expect margins to be constrained by lower revenue/pricing pressure, particularly in naloxone.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other area I didn’t like seeing was the guidance for a return to GAAP net losses of $10 to $30 million this year. So non-cash charges, restructuring items, and legacy costs are still meaningful, and accounting profitability is still pretty fragile despite the turnaround narrative management has been giving us. Management also highlighted a capital allocation shift toward shareholders and some indication of balance sheet repair. We have to give them credit here since they did just announce the repurchase of 3.1 million shares and the <a href=\"https://investors.emergentbiosolutions.com/news-releases/news-release-details/emergent-biosolutions-announces-new-50-million-stock-repurchase\" rel=\"nofollow\">authorisation </a>of a new $50 million buyback program. They also had that $100 million voluntary term loan prepayment, which has left us with a year-end liquidity of $305 million. While these actions signal financial discipline and near-term confidence, they also raise more questions about prioritising financial engineering over reinvestment. And that’s at a time when EBITDA is projected to fall by roughly 25% to 35% year over year. If I take all this together—the peaking profitability, a return to GAAP losses, and a pivot toward buybacks rather than growth—I think the current setup gives me a cautious stance, leaving Emergent as a hold for me following this earnings report.</p>",

The dividend coverage in Q4'25 was 98%, which is the first NII underperformance in the last year. As a result, the BDC lowered its dividend by 10% to $0.45 per-share quarterly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the current<span></span> quarter's NII no longer being sufficient to support the $0.50 per-share dividend, and a dividend cut announced, I believe Morgan Stanley Direct Lending will suffer from weak investor sentiment for a while... which may very well lead to a higher NAV discount in the short term.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col span=\"5\"> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td> </td> <td><strong>Q3'24</strong></td> <td><strong>Q4'24</strong></td> <td><strong>Q1'25</strong></td> <td><strong>Q2'25</strong></td> <td><strong>Q3'25</strong></td> <td><strong>Growth Y/Y</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>NII Per-Share</td> <td>$0.57</td> <td>$0.52</td> <td>$0.50</td> <td>$0.50</td> <td>$0.49</td> <td>-14.0%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total Dividend</td> <td>$0.50</td> <td>$0.50</td> <td>$0.50</td> <td>$0.50</td> <td>$0.50</td> <td>0.0%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Coverage Ratio</td> <td>114.0%</td> <td>104.0%</td> <td>100.0%</td> <td>100.0%</td> <td>98.0%</td> <td>-14.0%</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: Author</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>10% dividend cut weighs on valuation, as do SaaS fears</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Morgan Stanley Direct Lending is currently priced at a 27% discount to net asset value, which makes the BDC much cheaper than shares of Ares Capital and Blackstone Secured Lending, which have NAV discounts of 7% and 12%. Both BDCs are top-rated, however, and have delivered strong results for shareholders over time, especially Ares Capital... which is why the BDC is still priced at a relatively high P/NAV ratio. My current rating on ARCC is hold: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4867013-ares-capital-stock-robust-10-percent-yield-for-trying-times\">A Robust 10% Yield For Trying Times</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I believe that the SaaS sell-off is completely exaggerated, as I explained <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874592-oaktree-specialty-lending-bdc-market-sell-off-likely-overdone-hold\">here</a>, I would currently not recommend investors buy the drop in Morgan Stanley Direct Lending because of the negative sentiment overhang following the 10% dividend cut. In addition, the investment firm's 700% increase in non-accruals makes me uneasy, and the high net asset value discount now visible in the market reflects this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the longer term, assuming SaaS concerns prove to be unfounded and the sector recovers, I can see MSDL revaluing to its 3-year average P/NAV ratio of 0.95X. As of the end of the fourth quarter, MSDL's net asset value stood at $20.26 per share, so a fair value for the BDC may be around $19.28 per-share... which reconciles to the historical P/NAV ratio. This fair value may only be realized, however, if the BDC manages to transition to higher asset quality (implying a lower non-performing loan ratio, at least below 1.0%) and if its dividend coverage profile gets restored to at least 100% going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_edc94c3f8a89c4196620b626cbc5f746.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_edc94c3f8a89c4196620b626cbc5f746.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_edc94c3f8a89c4196620b626cbc5f746.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_edc94c3f8a89c4196620b626cbc5f746.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks with Morgan Stanley Direct Lending</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MSDL has ~20% exposure to the SaaS and software sectors in its portfolio -- about on-par with other BDCs -- which in the perception of investors, has become a major risk, given the discussion about AI disruption lately. I believe AI and SaaS fears are exaggerated, and investors are likely well-advised to refrain from panic selling until actual evidence mounts that this is in fact the case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What would specifically change my opinion and my stock rating on Morgan Stanley Direct Lending is if the BDC were to see; 1) an increase in the non-accrual ratio above 2.0%, 2) a drop in the dividend coverage ratio below 100% for two or more consecutive quarters even after the dividend was cut, or 3) a significant increase in defaults in loans that the company has made to the SaaS/software industry.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All things considered, I believe the value proposition for Morgan Stanley Direct Lending has not improved that much in the last several weeks, despite a higher net asset value discount. Morgan Stanley Direct Lending did not fully support its dividend with net investment income, and the investment firm actually has seen a material increase in its non-accrual percentage. In my opinion, the 27% discount to net asset value reflects concerns about the firm's NII trajectory, dividend coverage, and balance sheet quality. While I don't see the dividend cut as a specific reason to downgrade or sell MSDL, a dividend reset it always disappointing and can be expected to weigh on investor sentiment for a while.</p>",

While it has been a good time for both uranium and rare earths as the US aims to secure supplies, neither the Global X Uranium ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/URA\" title=\"Global X Uranium ETF\">URA</a>) nor the VanEck Rare Earths and Strategic Minerals ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/REMX\" title=\"VanEck Rare Earth and Strategic Metals ETF\">REMX</a>) come close to matching this rise (see chart below).

To start with, uranium production surprised on the upside, as mined amounts came in 20% higher than the top end of the guidance range (see table below) and 49% higher than the midpoint of the guidance range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similarly, processed uranium production was also a shade higher than the top-end of the guidance, and 20% higher than the midpoint. Sales volumes were significantly higher by 85% compared to the target of 350k.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-1772209239759065_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2332\" data-height=\"689\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-1772209239759065_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Uranium production and sales\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"189\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-1772209239759065_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-1772209239759065_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-1772209239759065_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-1772209239759065_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Uranium production and sales <span>(Source: Energy Fuels)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, uranium revenues rose by 27.3%. This is a complete reversal from my expectations last year, which had forecast a 56% drop in the number. Instead, the actuals came in 189% higher. This was for two reasons:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>At the time of these estimates, the midpoint sales guidance itself was lower at 250,000 pounds, which was subsequently revised upwards by 40%. And as earlier mentioned, the actual sales significantly exceeded even the upwardly revised guidance.</li> <li>Next, the realized uranium price assumption was USD 66.7 per pound, based on the price at that time. The actual figure was 11.2% higher at USD 74.2 per pound.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">...but heavy mineral sands affect revenues</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even then, though, total revenues contracted by 15.6% due to a pullback in revenues for heavy mineral sands, which represent the rare earths segment for Energy Fuels. Heavy mineral sands' revenue, dropped by 60% after the closure of the Kwale mine in Kenya in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The pullback in total revenue wasn't surprising, though, as my estimates had forecast a drop in uranium revenues. If anything, the extent of the drop was a relief. Even with an assumption of unchanged heavy mineral sands' revenues, a 27.6% drop in revenue was projected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With revenue weakness anticipated, I also pencilled in a loss in 2025, which also came to pass. In fact, the loss ballooned by 1.8x due to costs associated with the company's acquisition of the Australian rare earths producer Base Resources in late 2024, as well as expenses related to the company's expansion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Exceptional revenue growth to be seen in 2026</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenues in 2026, however, can look significantly better, based on the company's production and sales guidance as well as its recent acquisition of another rare earths producer, Australian Strategic Materials (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASMMF\" class=\"ticker-link\">OTCPK:ASMMF</a>). The details are below:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li> <strong>Robust production outlook for uranium:</strong> The production outlook for 2026 is robust, with a 31% increase in mined uranium and a much bigger 97% increase in processed uranium expected at the midpoint of the guidance ranges as provided (see table below). But the biggest increase is expected in sales, of 169%. Even if realised uranium price were to remain unchanged from 2025 and heavy mineral sands' revenues were to be nil, Energy Fuels would still see a near doubling in revenues from 2025.</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722092940245857_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2328\" data-height=\"547\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722092940245857_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Outlook, 2026\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"150\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722092940245857_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722092940245857_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722092940245857_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722092940245857_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Outlook, 2026 <span>(Source: Energy Fuels)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li> <strong>Expanding rare earths production potential:</strong> Next, there's the company's recent decision to acquire the rare earths producer Australian Strategic Materials through a share swap agreement plus a special dividend payout. This could add marginally to revenues as well, as Australian Strategic Materials has seen average annual revenues of USD 2.8 million over the past five years.</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, Energy Fuels' losses could increase even further in 2026, considering that Australian Strategic Materials' net losses have averaged USD 13.6 million annually over the past five years. For context, this amounts to ~16% of Energy Fuels' loss in 2025.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stronger longer-term prospects...</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking beyond this year, there are solid developments underway that can continue to support Energy Fuels' growth over the longer term, both from the perspective of rare earths and uranium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Russia and China hold dominant global positions in the supply of processed uranium and rare earths, respectively. With the US at loggerheads with both, ensuring security for these critical minerals has been underlined in recent times. Companies like Energy Fuels are well suited to make gains from this strategic development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It was already the biggest uranium producer in the US, and after its acquisition of Australian Strategic Materials, it has also become the biggest rare earths producer outside of China. While its rare earths' production is nil right now, the company aims to start producing dysprosium and terbium, both of which are restricted by China, in early 2027. Further, construction on the Vara Mada project in Madagascar, with <a href=\"https://www.mining.com/energy-fuels-estimates-1-8b-value-38-year-life-for-madagascar-mineral-sands-project/#:~:text=The%20Vara%20Mada%20project%20was,following%20refinements%20and%20further%20drilling.\" rel=\"nofollow\">promising financials</a> and a mine life of 38 years, is due to start in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the meantime, the company's uranium production can continue to benefit from the solid prospects as nuclear energy receives significant policy support and demand from big tech to power up their data centres.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">...but price run-up indicates stretched valuations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In financial terms, however, the extreme price run-up means that the stock is seeing stretched valuations. For 2026, my estimates indicate that the company can see a revenue of USD 130 million, which results in a forward P/S of 41.7x. This is much lower than the stock's five-year average forward ratio of 65.9x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the extreme price increase over the past year means that it's no longer a reliable indicator of what's next for the price. With uranium production and sales expected to be Energy Fuels' dominant focus in 2026, I compared how the stock stands against Cameco Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCJ\" title=\"Cameco Corporation\">CCJ</a>) instead. The big Canadian miner's forward P/S for this year is at a far smaller 20.2x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the company expected to turn profitable next year (see graphic below), over the longer term, the forward P/E is the relevant market multiple to consider. For 2029, analysts estimates on Seeking Alpha indicate a forward ratio of 51.9x. This, too, remains at least slightly high. For CCJ, the corresponding figure is at ~47x. I also compared it with the rare earths' producer MP Materials (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MP\" title=\"MP Materials Corp.\">MP</a>), which is at 27.2x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722529403635726_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2376\" data-height=\"893\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722529403635726_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Consensus EPS estimates\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"241\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722529403635726_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722529403635726_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722529403635726_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722529403635726_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's next?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Whichever way the valuations are considered, they look high right now. Of course, the company has projects underway, like Vara Mada, with promising estimates. But it will take a while to operationalise and the actuals could turn out different than current estimates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, there's a lot going for Energy Fuels right now. In terms of its critical minerals focus and its leading position as a US-based producer, it's in just the right position to reap the benefits of supportive policies. The company's latest production and sales numbers for uranium are only encouraging, and its outlook for 2026 is even more so.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The best course of action right now, would be to buy on any significant dips that reflect reduced market multiples. Otherwise, it's best to wait for more stability in financials before taking a call, especially for long-term investors. I'm retaining a Hold rating.</p>",

While the entire market sold off, the BDC sector got hammered extra hard and remained subdued for a longer time than the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then once everyone realized that actually the tariffs won’t have as drastic consequences as initially thought and the BDCs continued to deliver solid credit quality statistics, it took less than 4 months for the recovery process to get abrupted again. This time it was the bankruptcy of First Brands and Tricolor and the corresponding <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829881-jpmorgan-chase-and-co-jpm-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">“cockroach” phrase</a> that threw the BDCs back to square one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some months later, realizing that the promised cockroaches were somehow not emerging, the market initiated BDC recovery process again, which lasted until late January, 2026, when the SaaS aspect started to gain traction as a reason for BDC repricing. And here the dynamics at one of Blue Owl Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OWL\" title=\"Blue Owl Capital Inc.\">OWL</a>) private BDCs (OBDC II) came into play right around the same time, when SaaS selloff was at its peak moment. As a result of this combination, almost all BDCs plunged and entered into even steeper discount zones.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, the market is <a href=\"https://www.raymondjames.com/-/media/rj/dotcom/files/corporations-and-institutions/investment-banking/industry-insight/bdc_update.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">assuming</a> that about 23% of BDC NAVs (this includes the leverage effects) are effectively worthless.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The question becomes whether this time it is different. Could it be so that the BDC SaaS exposures (which are indeed material for many BDCs) fail and get converted to non-performing assets?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I doubt it because of the following (in no particular order):</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>In the Q4 earning call, the BDC management teams have all expressed no fears about SaaS investment blowout in their portfolios.</li> <li>The non-accrual levels of the BDCs that have so far reported their Q4 reports have remained rock-solid and in most cases the underlying companies have reported growing EBITDA generation levels.</li> <li>BDCs differ from broadly syndicated loan market as they typically implement strict underwriting standards, which come with conservative covenants and ample margin of safety (e.g., interest coverage levels at 2x+ and LTVs below 50%).</li> <li>The SaaS-driven non-accrual risk sounds like a broken record. It is only logical that BDCs go through cycles as they are inherently cyclical investments. And usually right at the cyclical lows, it is when bargain opportunities emerge that can warrant greater upside than just the offered dividend. This is what happened in the GFC, COVID-19, in 2022 when the interest rates were surging etc.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having said that, I fully appreciate the fact that for some investors venturing into BDCs at their cyclical lows when the risks are elevated and the future seems very uncertain might not be acceptable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, it could be so that the level of stress that would come with making BDC bets right would not compensate for the extra return potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, with this in mind, I would like to elaborate on two bulletproof BDCs, which could be bought right now, knowing that both portfolios and dividends are isolated from the SaaS-induced non-accruals.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2 durable NAV and safe dividend BDC picks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If I had to recommend two BDCs, which, in my view, offer the strongest level of protection from not only SaaS bankruptcies but also from a system-wide credit stress in the private credit space, I would go with Capital Southwest (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSWC\" title=\"Capital Southwest\">CSWC</a>) and Main Street Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAIN\" title=\"Main Street Capital Corporation\">MAIN</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It does not mean that these are my highest conviction buys from an attractive total return perspective, but certainly these would be picks that I could see in prudent retirement income investor's portfolio for whom a base dividend cut or a permanent value impairment is not an option.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me share four reasons, which should substantiate my stance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, it depends on a BDC, but many of the largest and well-known BDCs such as Sixth Street Specialty Lending (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLX\" title=\"Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc.\">TSLX</a>), Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BXSL\" title=\"Blackstone Secured Lending Fund.\">BXSL</a>) and Blue Owl Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OBDC\" title=\"Blue Owl Capital Corporation\">OBDC</a>) (but I could go on and on) carry meaningful exposures to SaaS sector. Typically, the portfolio bias towards SaaS is somewhere between 15% to 25%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, for both CSWC and MAIN the exposure to SaaS is below 5%. In CSWC's <a href=\"https://ir.capitalsouthwest.com/static-files/2fe3ecb1-cc82-4310-bce4-61b342d732f3\" rel=\"nofollow\">case</a> we cannot see it at a granular level, but given that it is not present in the Top 10 industry mix, which has 4% as the lowest mark, we can draw a conclusion that for CSWC the SaaS segment consumes less than 4% of the total book. For MAIN we can see this more clearly - i.e., SaaS accounts for ~2% of the LMM <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_2afe6f504d7c4121ebef0996b4c5e9e2/mainstcapital/db/396/11026/pdf/Q3+2025+MAIN+Investor+Presentation+v.ENDNOTES+-+vF+-+FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">loan book</a> and less than 8% of the private credit loan book (on a weighted average basis it translates to sub 4% exposure).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Already here we can basically neutralize the SaaS blowout risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, CSWC and MAIN invest with a strong margin of safety. The average portfolio company for these two BDCs has more robust leverage and interest coverage metrics than what we typically see for core middle market names.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, the weighted average leverage for CSWC portfolio company is only 3.6x, while the sector average falls closer to 4.5x. For MAIN's portfolio investments the leverage metric is even lower. And for example, the EBITDA to senior interest coverage is at 3.0x for MAIN's LMM investments, which means that the company would have to lose about two thirds of its EBITDA (business) to cause some real headache for the BDC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third, CSWC and MAIN are very well-positioned to expand their portfolios further, which should in turn result in incremental NII generation that could, in the worst case, be used to offset pressures from non-accruals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are two elements to take into account when thinking about growth capacities:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Additional borrowings. CSWC has a debt to equity of 1.08x, which is meaningfully below the sector average of 1.20x and a clear indicative of available debt capacity for growth in a financially prudent manner. For MAIN the debt load is much lower - i.e., debt to equity of 0.74x, which ranks it as the third lowest debt BDC out there.</li> <li>Fresh and accretive equity. Since CSWC and MAIN are internally managed BDCs and carry high-quality portfolios they trade at relatively healthy valuations, where the P/NAVs are above 1.0x. The presence of above NAV multiples enables accretive equity issuances that can provide capital for portfolio growth. Majority of BDCs do not have this (access to equity capital) available.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fourth, and this is also quite unique and important in the context of NAV stability and dividend durability, both BDCs could be deemed as equity-biased. Namely, the portfolios are saturated with high-quality equity investments, which can unlock further upside in the form of realized gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CSWC has 9.1% of its portfolio tied to high-quality equity investments. For MAIN the figure is even higher as the cumulative pre-tax net unrealized appreciation of its equity investments accounts for 11.7% of the total market cap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, the benefit of the equity tilt is that as these investments get monetized (happens periodically) they result in notable equity-like gains, which can balance out the headwinds from non-accruals or contribute to further NAV and dividend growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final words</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What we are currently seeing is yet another reminder that BDCs are cyclical instruments. When the sentiment shifts, they quickly drop into a deeply discounted zone, which is actually the right time to buy. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, going out in the market and scooping up discounted names, while the storm is still in the process is difficult. The risk of stepping into value traps is for sure higher than in normal times. Also, opening BDC positions right now might not necessarily be a stress-free exercise, which is also a critical aspect for many investors that I fully respect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So here I see a merit of buying CSWC and MAIN names, which still produce tangible dividends (11.5% by CSWC and 7.3% by MAIN) and are insulated from SaaS credit risks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this context, I would like to also insert the historical total return performance chart:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49926601-17721831774211764_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"743\" data-height=\"533\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49926601-17721831774211764_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Total returns\" width=\"640\" height=\"459\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"459\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49926601-17721831774211764_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49926601-17721831774211764_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49926601-17721831774211764_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49926601-17721831774211764_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ycharts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It really goes well in line with my thesis that MAIN and CSWC are indeed durable investment plays that have what it takes to withstand different cycles without value impairment.</p>",
