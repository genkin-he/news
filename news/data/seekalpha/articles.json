While some insurers may have worked inflationary concerns into their revised rates post-tariffs, consumers are unlikely to see related rates lowered now, Newsome said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"I don't think any insurer really changed prices because of the tariff, and I don't think if [the tariffs] go away, you'll see much of an impact as well,\" Newsome said. \"I think the insurance industry will just kind of keep trucking along, and you won't see much of an impact either way.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944718.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shares In U.S. Insurers Make Light Of Supreme Court Tariff Ruling\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"660\" height=\"462\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944718.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944718.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944718.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944718.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Tariff ruling</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a 6-3 ruling <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/25pdf/24-1287_4gcj.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">released Feb. 20</a>, the Supreme Court held that the Trump administration exceeded its authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose wide-ranging global tariffs, calling much of the administration's economic policy into question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the ruling, Trump has doubled down on the tariffs, signing Feb. 20 an executive order that imposes the 10% tariffs under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. Those went into effect Feb. 24, and Trump has subsequently threatened to raise the tariffs to 15%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some companies in the retail and imports sectors have filed lawsuits seeking reimbursements for tariffs paid to the US government. While those lawsuits remain ongoing, if refunds materialize, insurers are unlikely to be recipients, according to Newsome.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"Companies have to show how they were directly impacted, and because insurers are not actually importing or exporting anything, I would be surprised if any saw refunds,\" Newsome said.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Impacts vary by sector</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insurance and insurance-adjacent sectors such as healthcare and asset management reacted differently to the Supreme Court decision, but after a few days, there were only a couple of percentage points difference in terms of overall performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the insurance sector has been largely insulated against the tariffs, the property and casualty sector has some more exposure due to its reliance on imported parts for home and vehicle repairs, among other things susceptible to inflationary pressures, Newsome said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"When you start looking at where tariffs would potentially create inflation, it's there, but it's just proportionally not as big as other [financial sectors],\" Newsome said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even with the unpredictable ups and downs, Newsome expects insurers to emerge from this period of volatility in a good position. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944720.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shares In U.S. Insurers Make Light Of Supreme Court Tariff Ruling\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"660\" height=\"462\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944720.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944720.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944720.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_432944720.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/market-intelligence/en/news-insights/articles/2026/2/shares-in-us-insurers-make-light-of-supreme-court-tariff-ruling-99108701\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

Japan, by contrast, was an isolated feudal backwater, intentionally cut off from the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> rest of the world since the beginning of the Tokugawa Shogunate in 1603.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Faced with the obvious technical superiority of the West as they stared down the cannon barrels of Perry’s Black Ships, Japan’s leaders realized that nothing short of a far-reaching transformation away from the ossified practices of the ruling samurai class was going to be required.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Via the Meiji Restoration that began in 1868, they succeeded. By the end of the nineteenth century, Japan was a modernized industrial power carving out its own empire to compete with those of its Western peers. In 1905 it defeated one of those peers, the czarist empire of Russia, in the Russo-Japanese War and thus firmly established itself as a player in the great-power politics of the age.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Takaichi Trade</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The point of that little history lesson is that one should never count out Japan and its ability to reinvent itself. For the past thirty-odd years it has been easy to dismiss Japan as a once-strong economy whose time has come and gone. The Nikkei 225 stock index failed to regain its 1989 high point until 2024, 35 years later.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demography, deflation and debt summed up an economy listlessly drifting its way into senescence, stubbornly clinging to a shopworn model while the rest of the world raced ahead with successive generations of game-changing technologies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But recently, the country seems to have shaken off the malaise of these so-called lost decades. That long-suffering Nikkei 225 index has gone from also-ran to world-beating over the past twelve months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_chart_02_27_26.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nikkei 225\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"927\" height=\"572\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_chart_02_27_26.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_chart_02_27_26.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_chart_02_27_26.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_chart_02_27_26.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_chart_02_27_26.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A good portion of this outperformance can be attributed to the emergence of a new political star. Sanae Takaichi is a rarity in the world of Japanese politics in two ways: first, she is a woman, the first of her gender to attain the office of prime minister; and, second, that she is wildly popular.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Her initial victory last October sent the Nikkei surging, even as the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) that she heads struggled to piece together a coalition government. It surged again earlier this month when a snap election audaciously called by Takaichi resulted in an LDP victory of historic proportions and a clear green light for the new government to move ahead with its mandate for sweeping economic reform.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Takaichi Trap</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That mandate, though, is not without some potential headwinds. The Takaichi government seeks to implement a major stimulus program to reinvigorate industry, catalyze consumer spending (for example, by eliminating a consumption tax on food products) and establish a stronger geopolitical presence in the region.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This last item, which implies a big investment in Japan’s defense industry, has already created some waves after Takaichi made some supportive remarks in favor of Taiwan, remarks that provoked pointed criticism from China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the stimulus measures, they are going to have to contend with the Bank of Japan’s attempts to normalize monetary policy and keep a lid on inflation, which has made a somewhat surprising return in the past couple of years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Japanese bond yields have experienced some wobbles of late, as investors try to figure out how the BoJ and the Takaichi government are going to harmonize their respective agendas.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Remembering Shimonoseki</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is, of course, possible that the best-laid plans of the Takaichi government will fail in its attempts to re-establish Japan as a highly productive and energetic economy with world-class products and services. But, as we noted above, it is never wise to count the country out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reaching even farther back into the annals of history, in the late thirteenth century Japan was besieged by the superpower of the day, the Mongol empire of Kublai Khan. After a first encounter in which the Mongols gained some territory but then backed off to regroup, the Japanese built fortified protections strong enough to withstand future assaults.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Attack again the Mongol fleet did, but it failed to penetrate the fortifications, and while the fleet was stranded in the straits of Shimonoseki trying to advance, it was destroyed by a great typhoon – the “divine wind” the Japanese translation of which is “kamikaze.” The Mongols never attacked again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Japan is a highly conservative society with a pronounced resistance to change. But when it puts its mind to it, the country has shown in the past that it is capable of remarkable change in a very short period of time. As nations around the world grope for position in the changing global order, it may be time to give Japan another, closer look.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><a href=\"https://mvfinancial.com/news/mv-weekly-market-flash-japan-rises-again/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Original Post</a></em></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

However, Wall Street expects Q1 revenues to hover around $218 million, which is a significant growth of 72% YoY, driven by the combined revenues from Enfusion and Beacon. Moreover, Adjusted EBITDA margin may settle over 34% due to replacing the traditional jobs with AI, plus the rapid success in achieving operational synergies, which is expected to generate cash flows of $60 million.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><span>Valuation</span></strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since CWAN is currently trading at a $6.86 billion market cap and it has debts of $822.6 million and cash of $91 million, the EV is estimated at $7.6 billion. Considering that 2025 revenues are $731 million while 2026 revenues are estimated at $946 million, the EV/revenue of the company is around 8x-10x. Given the closest competitor, SS&amp;C Technologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNC\" title=\"SS&amp;C Technologies Holdings, Inc.\">SSNC</a>), which trades at a multiple of 4x, CWAN seems optically overvalued. But SSNC is a mature company and growing at a slower pace of approximately 7%. While the valuation gap favors CWAN because it relies completely on a pure cloud SaaS and grows at a faster rate of approximately 30%, therefore the market gives CWAN a premium based on its rapid growth, putting pressure on it to maintain this performance in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bae614dadfcd6bb9b56e8251a503d640.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bae614dadfcd6bb9b56e8251a503d640.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bae614dadfcd6bb9b56e8251a503d640.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bae614dadfcd6bb9b56e8251a503d640.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_8cfaaa2cfdffa70593e3f014551d8ded.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_8cfaaa2cfdffa70593e3f014551d8ded.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_8cfaaa2cfdffa70593e3f014551d8ded.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_8cfaaa2cfdffa70593e3f014551d8ded.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><span>Risks To Consider</span></strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>The company faces a set of risks, the first of which is the failure of the acquisition deal. Although the company obtained early termination of the waiting period under the HSR antitrust law, the major deals may collapse for one reason or another, as a sudden financing crisis may prevent the private funds from arranging the required loans for the deal. </span><span>Or a minority shareholder such as Starboard may vote against the deal if they think </span><span>that</span><span> the proposed price undervalues them; consequently, the stock may witness a violent downward</span><span> reaction from arbitrage funds, which will immediately liquidate their portfolios.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Also, merging the three entities Enfusion, Beacon, and Bistro with the company wouldn't be an easy mission, as integrating the cultures, databases, and programming languages is a very complex process for any management. If the integration efforts fail, this can lead to a temporary decline in the profit margins or even distract the management from core sales, which could push customers to flee to competitors.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Despite the optimism </span><span>of</span><span> Agentic AI capabilities, the accounting and asset management sector is </span><span>very</span><span> sensitive to errors; thus, any random error resulting from AI malfunctions could lead to data fabrications or </span><span>presenting</span><span> false information to regulators and central banks, </span><span>which</span><span> could expose clients to hefty fines.</span><span> While the company's business model operates in a very strict and regulated environment, this risk remains.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59349569-17721841639556403_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2258\" data-height=\"542\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59349569-17721841639556403_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CWAN 10-K Report\" width=\"640\" height=\"154\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59349569-17721841639556403_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59349569-17721841639556403_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59349569-17721841639556403_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59349569-17721841639556403_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>CWAN 10-K Report</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Final Thoughts</span></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Clearwater Analytics offers a unique technology </span><span>in order</span><span> to be the beating heart of $10 </span><span>trillion; </span><span>it is</span><span> also </span><span>able to free</span><span> its clients from bureaucratic labor.</span><span> The fruits of these advancements were evident in Q4 results, which jumped by 72%.

Last year, Chord set a goal of converting 80% of its inventory to long laterals. I'm happy to report that we achieved that goal by year-end 2025, which was earlier than expected, and is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our team.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851757128527.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chord Energy IR CHRD stock analysis seekingalpha valuation best oil stocks to buy 2026\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"633\" height=\"893\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851757128527.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851757128527.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851757128527.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Chord Energy IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financially, based on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CHRD/sec-filings\">CHRD’s latest report</a>, we see a strong balance sheet, with a net leverage of ~0.6x as of the latest report, and also no maturities until all the way in 2030 (and 2033), which I believe leaves significant room for more debt if they want to ramp up their expansion through another big acquisition or other developments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759407637_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1269\" data-height=\"729\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759407637_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chord Energy IR CHRD stock analysis seekingalpha valuation best oil stocks to buy 2026\" width=\"640\" height=\"368\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759407637_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759407637_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759407637_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/60669497-17721851759407637_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Chord Energy IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding Chord’s capital returns, I remain a big fan of their balanced approach, with the company prioritizing their balance sheet and leverage over returns, targeting 75%+ of adjusted FCF while the leverage is below 0.5x, 50%+ while the leverage is below 1x (nowadays), or just the base dividend plus potential for other returns when the leverage is above 1x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a note, their selected peers currently stand at a leverage of 1.1x, while the SPDR S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Expl &amp; Prod ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOP\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P Oil &amp; Gas Expl &amp; Prod ETF\">XOP</a>) is at 1.7x, so the fact that they are well below that and are still taking a very careful approach remains yet another factor that highlights their quality, in my opinion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the Q4 performance, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557362-chord-energy-declares-1_30-dividend\">CHRD has recently declared a $1.30/share quarterly dividend</a> (the base), which places them at a roughly 5% yield today, representing roughly $295 million per year, alongside $10 million in buybacks for the quarter, for a very solid ~48% payout ratio, in line with the target. However, if we assume an improvement in leverage and a 75% payout ratio on the $700 million FCF they expect in 2026, we’re talking about $525 million in total, meaning a yield of roughly 9%, which is not bad at all in such an environment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Macro Developments</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To update a key development started in the previous analysis, I want to begin this segment by quickly mentioning the situation in Venezuela. Under the current conditions, I believe Exxon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>) characterized Venezuela’s oil landscape very well when they <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/09/venezuela-is-uninvestible-for-now-exxon-ceo-tells-trump-in-white-house-meeting-00720198\" rel=\"nofollow\">called it “uninvestable,”</a> as we should keep in mind that it’s true that the country’s oil reserves are massive, but any operations there will require massive investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After all, we’re not only talking about one of the heaviest oils on the planet (lots of refining needed), but the infrastructure there is very old, likely the remnants of what American companies left there before they were nationalized (in 1976), with some upgrades made over time. In this oil environment, it’s very hard to find the funds (CAPEX-cutting environment) and the risk appetite to develop something in the country.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sure, things can improve in the long term and <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/venezuelas-acting-president-signs-overhaul-easing-state-control-of-oil-industry-into-law\" rel=\"nofollow\">the country is working on an overhaul of their oil industry</a> after Maduro was removed, but nothing guarantees that these operations <a href=\"https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2026/01/five-keys-to-understanding-venezuelas-oil-history/#:~:text=Foreign%20companies%20continued,the%2020th%20century\" rel=\"nofollow\">won’t be taken again</a> or economic conditions won’t change. After all, Trump’s term is over in about 3 years, and we can never know who comes to power next (in either country) and potentially cut the US’ grip that’s just now being developed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, there are several other uncertain factors that the market will pay attention to. If things were that simple, then this wouldn’t have been one of the most volatile commodities on the planet, after all. For example, although <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec-likely-maintain-oil-production-pause-march-prices-climb-sources-say-2026-01-26/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OPEC+ continued to go for their previously planned halt in production hikes</a> shortly after the Maduro operation, that’s providing some clarity only until the end of Q1, and a switch here can cause pressure on the price of oil once again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, very <a href=\"https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/2026/02/25/opec-to-consider-137000-bpd-oil-output-increase-for-april-reuters-sources-say/\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent reports</a> indicate that OPEC+ may decide to raise oil output by 137,000 bpd starting in April 2026 in order to meet peak summer demand, which can be only the beginning of more near-term pressure on the price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the situation in Iran is also developing, while the war in Ukraine is taking steps towards an eventual end, which can even lead to somewhat of the opposite of the price jumps, disruptions, and sanctions that came afterward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regardless, even before the current situation, we saw J.P. Morgan’s warning saying that we could even see <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4525655-brent-crude-could-slide-to-the-30s-without-production-cuts-jp-morgan-says\">oil drop into the $30s by 2027</a> in a massive oversupply scenario, which could be terrible for a company like CHRD, as the <a href=\"https://ir.chordenergy.com/2025-09-15-Chord-Energy-Announces-Strategic-Acquisition-of-Williston-Basin-Assets#:~:text=Inventory%20Quality%3A%C2%A0Low%20average%20NYMEX%20WTI%20breakeven%20economics%20%28%2440s%29%20compete%20at%20the%20front%2Dend%20of%20Chord%27s%20program%20and%20lower%20the%20weighted%2Daverage%20breakeven%20of%20Chord%27s%20portfolio%3B\" rel=\"nofollow\">Williston Basin inventory acquired recently,</a> for example, has a breakeven in the $40s.

If we start with their $700 million FCF in 2026 and, instead of the previous jump, assume a 4% CAGR until 2030, a 3% CAGR until 2035, and a 2.25% terminal growth rate, with a 15% discount rate and 56.84 million shares outstanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This gets us to an intrinsic value of $103.39, which almost perfectly mirrors the current level, taking into account a massive discount rate and weak growth despite the company’s achievements, which I don’t consider correct.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CHRD remains a Strong Buy, being in a very solid financial position, with prudent management that’s been delivering great improvements in recent years and a solid yield on top.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are risks to keep in mind, as their breakeven costs are still elevated given the basin exposure, but the company is advancing rapidly in a very good direction, transforming significantly since it was formed, which I believe should warrant better valuations going forward.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a final note, especially given <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4545336-devon-energy-coterra-energy-to-merge-in-all-stock-deal-valued-at-58b\">the continued M&amp;A activity seen in the market</a>, I wouldn’t be surprised to see another peer try to acquire CHRD given the valuation, quality, and size.</p>",

The market has been focused in<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the past year on gold miners, while other segments of the investing universe should also have taken some bandwidth.

After the 2022 invasion, Russia's reserves abroad were frozen.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>After Russia’s full-scale invasion, the U.S. and its allies froze Russian foreign exchange reserves in their jurisdictions. The Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force—consisting of the Group of Seven (G7), European Union (EU), and Australia—most recently estimated frozen reserves at $280 billion. Many experts (and the Central Bank of Russia) put the figure between $300 and $330 billion.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This move has made it clear to many foreign countries that dollar- and euro-denominated assets can have the same fate in the case of a conflict.

Note that gold miners are virtually not represented currently, but keep in mind this ETF is active and thus can choose to change holdings as valuations make sense.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund is very new, but we can have a look at how it has done versus some other names in the space:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48943276-17722164584826117_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"727\" data-height=\"518\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48943276-17722164584826117_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"456\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48943276-17722164584826117_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48943276-17722164584826117_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48943276-17722164584826117_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48943276-17722164584826117_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Performance <span>(YCharts)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since its inception, METL has put in a performance very much in line with the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GDX\" title=\"VanEck Gold Miners ETF\">GDX</a>) and has underperformed the silver focused SIL. METL is more focused currently on the metal equities next in line for substantial rallies, namely copper and rare earths. We view the fund as a great allocator to the metals space, especially when considering higher prices for longer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund portfolio managers have the flexibility to invest in equities associated with a wide range of metals thus can provide exposure to specific metals potentially positioned for outperformance based on market macro conditions and intrinsic valuation metrics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some analytics around this ETF are as follows:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>AUM: $112 M</li> <li>Expense ratio: 0.89%</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund does not have enough historical data to generate reliable risk analytics, but given the performance correlation with SIL and GDX, one can safely assume very similar risk statistics for now. METL will be able to generate better analytics long term due to its active management, so we are excited to see the name outperform as we move forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">METL is a new ETF from Sprott, focused on metals miners across the spectrum. The fund is active and thus can change its composition as it sees fit. The ETF is currently overweight copper and silver miners, with almost no gold miners present in the holdings. The fund has done very well since its recent inception (September 2025), being up over +50%. The name represents a great portfolio diversifier for individuals believing higher metal prices are here to stay for longer.</p>",

The precious metal is closing well above its early February monthly highs as metals caught a strong bid in today's action. <em>These are preparations for something happening over the weekend.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Week Ahead: NFP and PMIs all around the globe</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Asia Pacific Markets: A condensed data package for APAC</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next week should be exciting for APAC traders. Without counting geopolitics, macro traders will await three PMI reports for China. There has been a surprising drop in the data as of late, and the PBoC is talking about supporting their economy, not through market-wide stimulus but with targeted assistance. It will be interesting to see how it plays out in the data.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Australian dollar will once again be on the front scene, between inflation surveys, a speech from Governor Bullock, PMIs, trade data and GDP. It's going to be a very essential week for the 2026 FX leader. Let's see if it holds up to the test.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Japan, traders will be listening closely to Governor Ueda's speech on Monday night. A hike could be coming towards mid-month for the Bank of Japan, and he upped his tone recently regarding the possibility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>With two new decision-makers entering the Bank of Japan in the next months, it could be his last opportunity to build some form of consensus.</em></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Europe and UK Markets: Eurozone and Swiss Inflation</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The heavy slate of data also spreads to Europe with inflation data (consumer prices and producer prices) releasing. Friday will also see the yearly data for EU GDP, so keep this one in check.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But the largest culprit will be the Swiss inflation report, where traders should confirm whether negative rates will be a thing or not. A heavy test for FX markets.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">North American Markets: More PMIs, but most importantly, non farm payrolls</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next week is going to be huge for North America. Without mentioning Iran, traders will receive a streak of PMIs from Canada and the US.

It offers a low-cost option to investors seeking both dividend income and potential capital growth. The ETF focuses on the top 80 high-dividend-yielding companies within the S&amp;P 500 Index. SPYD can serve as a core fund for building a diversified portfolio across asset classes.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>SPYD is a medium-sized ETF, now with $7.6 billion in assets under management as of February 25, 2026. That’s up from just $6.5 billion at the time of my previous analysis. The </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYD/expenses\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span>annual expense ratio</span></a><span> is low at only 7 basis points, while the trailing 12-month </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYD/dividends/scorecard\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span>dividend yield</span></a><span> is high at 4.11%, about 2.9 percentage points above that of the S&amp;P 500.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYD/momentum/performance\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span>Share-price momentum</span></a><span> has improved markedly just in the last handful of months, now earning the product a B- ETF Grade in that category by Seeking Alpha’s quantitative scoring system (it was a D- back in November). From a </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYD/risk\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span>risk perspective</span></a><span>, SPYD scores decently, but high exposure to cyclical and defensive sectors can bring about a unique set of risks, namely steep negative alpha when the Mag 7 take off. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>For now, </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYD/liquidity\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><span>liquidity</span></a><span> is quite strong. Average daily volume is north of 1.8 million shares, while the median 30-day bid/ask spread is very tight at just two basis points, per State Street Funds.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>For an update on the portfolio, the 2-star, Gold-rated ETF by Morningstar plots (not surprisingly) on the far-left side of the style box, indicating its weight toward the value style. There is no growth access, while more than 80% of the allocation is classified as SMID-cap by Morningstar. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>While the fund is largely unexposed to some of today’s biggest AI risks (as seen in the software industry), macroeconomic factors play a large role in price action. Interest rates are particularly key. In general, the lower Treasury yields go, the more attractive high-yield equities become.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>On valuation, SPYD’s price-to-earnings ratio is very compelling at 13.7x, but the long-term earnings growth rate is also modest, near 6%. I would not be surprised to see EPS estimates get taken higher, as broader profit growth cascades across the so-called “real” economy.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SPYD: Portfolio &amp; Factor Profiles</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369055743294_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"913\" data-height=\"804\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369055743294_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SPYD: Portfolio &amp; Factor Profiles\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"564\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369055743294_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369055743294_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369055743294_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369055743294_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Zooming in on the sector breakdown, Real Estate is by far the largest stake.

Notice in the chart below that the fund is right near all-time highs. It scaled the November 2024 previous high-water mark after surging from November through the turn of this year. Now, with a rising long-term 200-day moving average, the bulls clearly control the primary trend. Price is above the 50 dma, which is higher than the 200 dma.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Also take a look at the volume by price profile on the left side of the graph. There should be major support if we see a pullback. For now, support is right near the current price, with a firmer layer between $45 and $45. I expect the current bull flag pattern to resolve higher, and it makes sense that the ETF is working off technical overbought conditions (as evidenced by the RSI momentum oscillator at the top of the chart).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>In terms of an upside target, a measured move objective to $67 is in play based on the depth of the Q4 2024 to April 2025 decline and subsequent breakout.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SPYD: Bullish Upside Breakout, Bull Flag, Rising 200dma</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369052321196_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"922\" data-height=\"555\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369052321196_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SPYD: Bullish Upside Breakout, Bull Flag, Rising 200dma\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369052321196_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369052321196_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369052321196_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/36131525-17721369052321196_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Stockcharts.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>The Bottom Line</span></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>I have a buy rating on SPYD.
