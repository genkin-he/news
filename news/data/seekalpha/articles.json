That's a lot, especially after two years of relative quiet in the share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When prices move a lot in a relatively short amount of time, it is natural for investors to get concerned and they want to talk about it more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We don't blame them. The best thing to do is to try to understand the moving parts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Moving Parts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, we have NAV (Net Asset Value) – this is a number that is reported by OXLC every month. It represents the current fair value of OXLC's assets minus liabilities, divided by shares outstanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NAV is down. As of Dec 31, 2024, OXLC's NAV was $24.10 (adjusted for split). Since NAV is reported monthly, we can't state with certainty what it is today, but <a href=\"https://ir.oxfordlanecapital.com/news-market-data/press-releases/news-details/2025/Oxford-Lane-Capital-Corp--Provides-September-8-2025-Net-Asset-Value-Update/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">OXLC reported</a> its NAV as of Sept 8, 2025, as between $20.02 and $20.22. So, let's call it $20.12.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If OXLC traded at NAV, its price would have been down 16.5% as of Sept 8th. Its market price was down nearly twice that at -30% from Jan 1 through Sept 8, 2025. If OXLC simply traded exactly at NAV, as of Sept 8, 2025, it would have lost $3.98 in value, and it would have paid $3.60 in dividends for a total return of -1.6% as of Sept 8th. I'd dare say if that was the case, OXLC wouldn't be getting much attention.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Market Price</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, OXLC doesn't trade at NAV. It is a CEF, and unlike ETFs that trade at NAV, the price of a CEF is set by the market. Individual investors buying and selling influence the market price. As of Dec 31 2024, OXLC was trading at a 5.2% premium to NAV. On Sept 8 2025, it closed at $17.75, an 11.8% discount to NAV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, from Jan 1 to Sept 8, 2025, nearly half of the decline in OXLC's share price is attributable to the market changing from a premium to NAV to a discount to NAV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This change in the difference between NAV and market price can be a negative over certain timeframes. That the price is disconnected from NAV is a huge benefit for investors who can keep a clear head.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In his <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2013ltr.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">2013 Letter to Shareholders</a>, Warren Buffett made a comparison between stocks and a farm that he had bought:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>\"After all, if a moody fellow with a farm bordering my property yelled out a price every day to me at which he would either buy my farm or sell me his – and those prices varied widely over short periods of time depending on his mental state – how in the world could I be other than benefited by his erratic behavior? If his daily shout-out was ridiculously low, and I had some spare cash, I would buy his farm. If the number he yelled was absurdly high, I could either sell to him or just go on farming.\"</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market price in relation to NAV is a neighbor shouting out different valuations every day. However, there is an underlying asset. Regardless of what the neighbor is shouting, the farm might be a good farm that produces an abundant yield, or it could be a bad farm where crops struggle to grow.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The OXLC Income Farm</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, we know the current yield of the OXLC is very high. We know that the price our neighbors were shouting on Sept 8 was a steep discount to the NAV of this income farm. It is very likely in our estimation that the price being shouted today is an equally sizable and possibly larger discount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last time OXLC traded at a price this low was in May of 2020, and its NAV (split adjusted) was $14.35-$14.85. Yes, OXLC was actually trading at a premium despite COVID, despite slashing its dividend in half, and despite default rates spiking. Despite trading at close to the same price as today, the total return over 5.5 years was over 160%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_cb3122e72a666839acbcc5aeded255f7.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_cb3122e72a666839acbcc5aeded255f7.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_cb3122e72a666839acbcc5aeded255f7.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_cb3122e72a666839acbcc5aeded255f7.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_cb3122e72a666839acbcc5aeded255f7.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_cb3122e72a666839acbcc5aeded255f7.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_cb3122e72a666839acbcc5aeded255f7.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_cb3122e72a666839acbcc5aeded255f7.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/saupload_cb3122e72a666839acbcc5aeded255f7.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's the power of dividends. We don't need price increases. They're nice, but not an essential or even significant portion of our total return.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, OXLC is trading at a steep discount. Its dividend is the same level as it was in 2023 and the first half of 2024. This is much higher than it was in 2021/2022 when its price hit the most recent peak.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Default rates remain low relative to history. Yes, the First Brands bankruptcy filed in September will likely lead to a loss in many CLOs, but the average exposure was 0.24%. Default exposure for CLOs rose to 0.7% in September, <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/us-bsl-clo-default-exposure-rises-again-after-first-brands-default-10-10-2025\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener\">according to Fitch</a>. In 2020, serious people like Morgan Stanley and Blackstone <a href=\"https://www.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/05/gso-impact-of-loan-downgrades-on-clos-may-2020-bglf.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">were predicting</a> that CLO default rates could exceed 10%. In hindsight, they were wrong. But at that time, such an assertion wasn't crazy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Facts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, let's step away from the drama and look at the facts.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>OXLC is trading at more than a 15% discount to NAV, when historically, it has traded at a premium even during distressed times.</li> <li>Today isn't a distressed time. Exposure to defaults among all CLOs is 0.7%, which is below average, albeit higher than we saw for most of the past few years.</li> <li>The best time to buy OXLC in history was when it was trading at today's prices, even though at that time those prices were a premium to NAV. (Today they are at a discount).</li> <li>Investors who sold in 2020 lost their shirts. Investors who held/bought saw significant upside in the following years.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Unknowns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, there are some unknowns. We know the OXLC farm yields a lot right now. We also know that yield isn't set in stone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2020, we saw OXLC slash its dividend in half when credit was being downgraded, and default rates did see a spike. Right now, defaults aren't high, and corporate credit appears quite solid. What's happening right now isn't what will happen forever. It is possible that it could fall apart and force a dividend cut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OXLC is trading at a steep discount to NAV. That discount will probably be reduced, but it can decline in three ways. OXLC's price could rise, or its NAV could decline, or a combination of both.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Right now, the credit markets aren't distressed - yet. There are certainly those who are hypothesizing that the credit markets will deteriorate soon. That fear is likely the primary reason why credit risk stocks are selling off, and OXLC is pure leveraged credit risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last time OXLC's NAV and price was this low, it was a screaming buy in 20/20 hindsight. At the time, people were saying it was too risky, the price being down so much proved it was a bad investment, COVID-19 would cause massive defaults, etc. As it turned out, defaults weren't as bad as feared, NAV bounced up, the price bounced up, and dividends were raised.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But past results do not guarantee future results. Investors feared a default wave, and for the most part, the defaults that did happen after COVID-19 were smaller, had higher recoveries, and occurred at a slower pace than feared. CLOs had some losses, but much less than many expected. OXLC's primary \"loss\" of NAV was from its decision to overpay the dividend. They declared 6-months of dividends before the crisis, and opted to payout those dividends even though they weren't anywhere close to covered by cash flow. If they had cut the dividend more quickly, like peers did, their NAV would have seen a higher recovery. I'm not going to hold that against them as someone who benefited from the overpayments.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OXLC is trading at an absolute price and a valuation that we've only seen in the heart of a crisis. Even if there were going to be a crisis, one could argue that it is reasonably priced in. We believe that the default cycle is going to be relatively mild for credit. If we are right on that point, OXLC is a huge winner going forward. If we are wrong, then OXLC is probably ahead of the curve and has already priced in a crash that the rest of the market is going to catch up to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Keep your position size at a level that can absorb fear-based price swings. That should be a routine practice with all investments. Make your assessment of what you believe will happen with corporate credit, and make your decision. All investments involve risk, and this particular investment revolves around whether corporations will pay their bills or go bankrupt. In the long run, that is the only thing that matters for determining how much OXLC will be able to pay in dividends in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will say, when there is a new drama diva in town, the best thing to do is to make your assessment, make your decision, and follow through. Keep your head clear, and focus on the things that actually matter, like default rates and cash flow. Don't get wrapped up in the drama of market price.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The ultimate question you have to answer is \"will corporate default rates be high like the Great Financial Crisis, or low like COVID?\" We believe it will be low, and that's why we are taking advantage of OXLC's low prices.</p>",

It’s great for my ego and my portfolio.</p> <p>All kidding aside, sometimes, I would rather not be right, especially when it comes to my \"higher for longer\" thesis, which I have maintained since the end of the 2020 pandemic lockdowns. While I<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> won’t recycle the entire thing, it was basically based on a few key pillars:</span></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Globalization became deglobalization</strong>, which was pushed by both Democrats and Republicans in the United States. This includes Trump’s first round of tariffs in 2017-2021, President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, and the current tariffs from President Trump’s second term. Needless to say, there’s more, as both parties know that America has an opportunity to rebuild its industrial base and a duty to de-risk supply chains. The pandemic was a wake-up call. Given how serious new trends like AI and robotics are, supply chain resilience is absolutely critical. Rebuilding supply chains and fewer low-cost products from overseas are inflationary.</li> <li> <strong>The shale revolution ended</strong>. While both oil and gas production are still rising, the 2009-2021 growth rates are gone, as most basins in the United States have matured, and drillers are running out of Tier 1 reserves. Dirt-cheap natural gas and oil were a major deflationary factor before 2021.</li> <li> <strong>Both labor and material availability</strong> were much better before the pandemic.</li> <li> <strong>The benefits of the Internet</strong> went into overdrive, as software took over and most companies could suddenly become very asset-light. This was deflationary.</li> <li> <strong>Artificial intelligence is super energy-intensive</strong>. While I believe AI will eventually turn into a major deflationary factor after 4-5 years due to its impact on process efficiencies (this is super bad for labor), it is currently creating massive bottlenecks in power and infrastructure markets. This is very inflationary.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on this context, the chart below (1-year forward inflation expectations) shows exactly what I mean. Before the Great Financial Crisis, 2% inflation may have been a goal, but it certainly hasn’t been achieved. Then, between the Great Financial Crisis and 2021, inflation was so low that the Fed actually struggled to raise it to 2%, which provided a lot of liquidity from various QE programs, including from other banks like the European Central Bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, inflation has clearly entered a new regime, as 3% seems to be the new normal.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1320\" data-height=\"465\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"225\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605492190447_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To make matters worse, the economy is split into two camps, consisting of the part that benefits from secular growth, like AI, and the group that focuses on the more \"normal\" aspects of the real economy. These cyclical and consumer companies have not been doing so well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s why I have increasingly covered another very important aspect, which is my conviction that the Fed, with support from the government, will \"run it hot.\" If I had to summarize this thesis in just one sentence, it would be something like, \"Because of major challenges in cyclical areas, AI-related labor weakness, and a stuck housing market, the Fed and government will likely accept higher inflation to boost nominal growth, also benefiting the real debt load of the government along the way.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A few days ago, on October 26, I wrote an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833317-the-feds-most-dangerous-gamble-could-be-our-biggest-opportunity\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833317-the-feds-most-dangerous-gamble-could-be-our-biggest-opportunity\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> titled <em>\"The Fed’s Most Dangerous Gamble Could Be Our Biggest Opportunity.\"</em> It was all about these developments, and a part of my takeaway can be read below:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p><em>My main point is that investors should be aware of current economic shifts and what the Fed and government are doing, including the risks. Focus on inflation, high-quality assets, and the risks and opportunities of AI disruption.</em></p> <p><em>We're more than likely in a \"higher for longer\" environment of sticky inflation and institutions like the Fed that are forced to stimulate without risking runaway inflation.</em></p> <p><em>This is both important and very risky. However, it can be done if deregulations and other government policies instill confidence and boost business sentiment. While I’m not at all happy with the downside risks, which are potential stagflation, I’m very upbeat and expect it can be achieved.</em></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, last month, I wrote a similar <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824421-why-im-positioning-my-portfolio-for-feds-most-dangerous-gamble-yet\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824421-why-im-positioning-my-portfolio-for-feds-most-dangerous-gamble-yet\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> where I highlighted the words of my close friend and hedge fund advisor, Albert Marko:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p><em>[...] the Trump administration appears to be embracing that reality with a high-stakes gamble, as it is likely to target (or accept) 4% inflation and high single-digit nominal GDP growth.</em></p> <p><em>While I may sound a bit dramatic, I believe this is a full-blown paradigm shift, one that could—and likely will—renew markets for years.</em></p> <p><em>For investors, this means adapting to a world where cyclical stocks, hard assets, and value will likely outperform growth. - Albert Marko</em></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Essentially, my view has been that 3-4% is the new normal, which makes being prepared for higher inflation even more important, as even slight increases in inflation over time have a devastating effect on our purchasing power.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we can see below, 2% inflation over 20 years requires us to grow our wealth by roughly 50% to break even. A 4% inflation rate requires us to 1.2x our capital to achieve the same result.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1310\" data-height=\"1076\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"526\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605498395565_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Calculator.net (Inflation Calculator)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason I’m bringing all of this up is that my call is getting confirmation, which is another way of saying that Wall Street may get used to the idea that we may have to adjust our inflation expectations and potentially move some money around.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That creates opportunities.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Get Used to 3% and a Totally Different Macro Environment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"Getting Used to 3% Inflation\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was the title of a Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/inflation-3-percent-consumer-prices-washington-federal-reserve-jerome-powell-4829ae34\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.wsj.com/opinion/inflation-3-percent-consumer-prices-washington-federal-reserve-jerome-powell-4829ae34\" target=\"_blank\">opinion piece</a> that was published on October 24.

I’m not saying that to be political, but because it is an inflationary force.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, I really like the last paragraph, which confirms my own thesis:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>Meanwhile, for all the controversy over Mr. Trump’s attempts to meddle with the Fed, he and Mr. Powell both seem to want lower interest rates. It makes us wonder if 3% is Washington’s new de facto inflation target. [...]. - WSJ</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To reiterate, this isn’t a political article. I am not saying Powell or Trump want higher inflation to hurt anyone. I have always made the case that they will accept higher inflation to boost nominal growth and broaden general economic growth, including getting the housing market unstuck, boosting cyclical growth, and lowering the real (post-inflation) value of the national debt. If they are successful, the net effect on the U.S. economy could even be good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The downside is that they let inflation run hot and fail to grow the economy. One doesn’t need a fancy degree in economics (I certainly don’t have one) to know that the consequences of that could be very bad.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far, my thesis (using my \"Fed Gamble\" article) and this article have a few things in common:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>We agree that the Fed and government accept higher inflation.</li> <li>We agree that this is a dangerous endeavour.</li> <li>We both note that higher liquidity is inflationary.</li> <li>We both note that tariffs are a hidden inflationary factor (albeit short-term and somewhat muted).</li> <li>We both believe that the average household underestimates these factors.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, obviously, there’s more evidence. Reuters, for example, wrote a great <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-cementing-higher-inflation-regime-2025-10-22/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-cementing-higher-inflation-regime-2025-10-22/\" target=\"_blank\">piece</a> titled <em>\"U.S. cementing higher inflation regime.\"</em> It was published on October 22. Here’s a part I really liked:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p><em>Indeed, Fed board member Chris Waller - tipped by some to be the next Fed chair - opined last week that inflation is basically at target, and even floated the idea that an inflation range, rather than a point target should now be considered.</em></p> <p><em>With most of the Fed's top brass now focused on the labour market, it appears that many policymakers aren't overly concerned about inflation that is within a point or so of 2%. - Reuters</em></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These developments matter so much because it’s all a slow but steady shift in the narrative. First, the Fed failed to get inflation to 2%. Now, voices get louder so that we may not see 2% at all, as a new target range may be more appropriate. As I don’t expect the Fed to ever come out and publicly announce that they are fine with higher inflation (can you imagine?), I think they will communicate a wider target and shift the focus to protecting economic stability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, the potential impact of AI on the labor market could be a great opportunity to ease. Purely theoretically, if I wanted to boost liquidity, I would use that as a reason.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s why there is much more evidence out there than what I have shown you so far. Here’s what Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Beth Hammack said when she made the case that inflation is likely to stay above target until at least 2028:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p><em>Speaking in an interview with CNBC from Frankfurt, the policymaker observed that the central bank has missed its 2% goal for more than 4 1/2 years, and is likely to keep doing so for some time.</em></p> <p><em>“I continue to see that we have pressure in inflation, both in the headline, in the core, and particularly where I’m worried about it is, I’m seeing it in services,” Hammack said. “My forecast is that we’re going to remain above target for probably the next one to two years, and not really getting back down to our objective of 2% until the end of 2027 or early 2028.” - <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/fed-s-hammack-is-still-worried-about-outlook-for-us-inflation\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-29/fed-s-hammack-is-still-worried-about-outlook-for-us-inflation\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a></em></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The toughest part is that the Fed is losing control over key indicators like employment. While it uses weak employment as an official reason to ease financial conditions, it seems that AI is entirely in charge of employment. For that, we can use the JOLTS data in the chart below. As we can see, layoffs aren’t accelerating, yet new hires have come to a halt.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"947\" data-height=\"727\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"491\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605493997736_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Wells Fargo</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is also one of the reasons why many people in the comment sections of my articles bring up the fear that further AI disruption could eventually derail the economy. To that, I have to say that I sadly agree. I truly think AI is going to create havoc. However, it doesn’t mean the market is toast, as the S&amp;P 500 isn’t necessarily the economy. Until AI benefits the valuations of the hyperscalers and creates a trickle-down effect from the data center boom, a lot of employment weakness will likely be offset.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I also believe that potential further employment deterioration will put even more pressure on the president and the Fed to ease rates, especially as we head into the midterm elections.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is bullish for liquidity, bullish for bonds, and bullish for (cyclical) stocks, if you ask me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The obvious question is how long it will last.

While the quote below is three years old, the inflation findings are still valid:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>We think the last decade was an anomaly. When widening the lens, we found that stocks in the top two quintiles by dividend yield delivered superior returns over the past four decades. In our view, the second quintile is particularly attractive on a risk-adjusted basis, as it avoids riskier companies with unsustainably high payout ratios. And our research suggests that this long-term return potential comes with a bonus: attractive performance in an inflationary world. - <a href=\"https://www.alliancebernstein.com/corporate/en/insights/investment-insights/equity-income-the-dividend-defense-against-inflation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.alliancebernstein.com/corporate/en/insights/investment-insights/equity-income-the-dividend-defense-against-inflation.html\" target=\"_blank\"><span></span></a></em><em>AllianceBernstein</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This brings me to point three. If we combine the first two points, we get a strong tailwind for (higher-yielding) dividend stocks in the energy space, which is a thesis supported by Hartford Funds' findings that show energy stocks have, by far, the highest probability to beat inflation and the highest outperformance among equities, as we can see below.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1204\" data-height=\"764\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"406\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494239063_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Hartford Funds</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This explains why I like energy stocks so much. Especially the higher-yielding ones like Diamondback Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FANG\" title=\"Diamondback Energy, Inc.\">FANG</a>), Canadian Natural Resources (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNQ\" title=\"Canadian Natural Resources Limited\">CNQ</a>), which I own, Viper Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VNOM\" title=\"Viper Energy, Inc.\">VNOM</a>), which is a variable/special dividend royalty play in the Permian Basin, and the big ones like Exxon Mobil (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>) and Chevron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX\" title=\"Chevron Corporation\">CVX</a>), which may be boring but are great income stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Don’t get me wrong. This isn’t an energy article. In general, companies with pricing power are a great way to be protected. This even includes boring REITs that often have fixed annual rent escalators somewhere close to 2%. Even if inflation runs hot, they will eventually benefit from it through mark-to-market adjustments during rent renewals. That’s why they have the second-highest probability of beating inflation, according to the same Hartford data.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, all transportation companies I own use fuel surcharges to offset energy inflation, while retailers like Home Depot (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HD\" title=\"The Home Depot, Inc.\">HD</a>) regularly adjust their prices. In other words, while many companies may not benefit from inflation, many adjust. The most straightforward example is Walmart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>), which sells to consumers who are, in general, not in a good spot to take on higher inflation. As long as Walmart keeps its gross margins aligned, it should be fine over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, for investors like you and me, it’s not about turning our entire portfolios into trading vehicles. We should stick to the core, which is (for most readers) conservative long-term investing.

While stocks (S&amp;P 500), in general, are good long-term investments, we have seen many decades where inflation offset gains, causing investors to see their wealth go sideways for sometimes an entire generation.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1816\" data-height=\"966\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/31557165-17615605494692295_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>Multpl</p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s also why I will keep showing you my favorite actionable ideas in the days, weeks, quarters, and likely even years that lie ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, this is my takeaway:</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We’re now at the point I hoped we could avoid, which is that my \"higher for longer\" thesis is slowly but steadily going mainstream. After a fantastic post-Great Financial Crisis decade, people are starting to realize the underlying fundamentals have shifted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 2% goal now seems to be a \"bridge too far,\" to use the title of a famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bridge_Too_Far_%28film%29\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bridge_Too_Far_%28film%29\" target=\"_blank\">WW2 movie</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe 3-4% inflation will be the new normal, which is supported by new developments that all hint at plans to \"run it hot,\" which is an experiment I will continue to spend a lot of time on going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It also means we may have to make some portfolio adjustments, as the mix of the market’s lofty valuation and inflation risk poses a serious threat to our ability to generate value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s why I am increasingly focused on energy, high-quality dividend stocks, and other companies with substantial pricing power.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To me, it’s not about being right but about being prepared, as especially younger people could run into much bigger problems when it comes to building wealth than the generations who enjoyed the bull market of the past two decades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, eventually, I think the impact of AI will be very deflationary. However, until we are dealing with inflationary power and infrastructure bottlenecks, I think that’s at least 5 years away.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, stay tuned for more!</p>",

The company has shown much better cost control in Q2 and now in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, the company was forced to revise down the annual gold production guidance from 580-630Koz to 560-580Koz now in Q3. This is due to a few assets underperforming in the year, with some downtime at Magino and Island Gold most recently. So, even if Q3 is an improvement to Q2, which was in turn much better than Q1, and Q4 will be substantially better than Q3. The improvements haven't been fast enough to offset the weakness at the beginning of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A positive recent development was that Alamos Gold has <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/09/15/3149643/0/en/Alamos-Gold-Announces-the-Sale-of-its-Turkish-Development-Projects-for-Total-Cash-Consideration-of-470-million.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> the sale of its idle Turkish assets for $470M, where $160M will be paid at the closing of the deal and the remaining sums within two years. This deal has since closed in early Q4. The company was given little value for these assets by the market, so this was a very welcomed outcome from a complicated situation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 2025 Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617780716916745_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1126\" data-height=\"537\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617780716916745_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 2 - Source: Alamos Gold Quarterly Reports\" width=\"640\" height=\"305\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617780716916745_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617780716916745_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617780716916745_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617780716916745_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617780716916745_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617780716916745_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617780716916745_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617780716916745_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 2 - Source: Alamos Gold Quarterly Reports</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alamos Gold reported record revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted earnings in the most recent quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $284M, up 9% compared to Q2 2025. The company also reported a record free cash flow of $130M, despite aggressively investing in growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Presently, there are three projects in construction, which are funded by operating cash flow. The fact that Alamos Gold is still generating record free cash flow is very impressive and the strong gold price has no doubt helped. I would note that Lynn Lake is now somewhat delayed due to wildfires and production is not expected to begin until 2029. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1218\" data-height=\"446\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 3 - Source: Alamos Gold Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"234\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618113636360407_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 3 - Source: Alamos Gold Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company reported a gold production of 141,700 gold ounces in Q3, up 3% compared to Q2. The gold sales were slightly lower than production at 136,473 ounces, which might have put some upward pressure on unit costs. The realized gold price of $3,359/oz was also a record in the most recent quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alamos Gold increased its cost guidance earlier this year due to the higher gold price and the underperformance of Magino and Young-Davidson. The cash cost was $973/oz and the all-in sustaining cost (\"AISC\") was $1,375/oz in Q3. These were 9% and 7% declines compared to Q2 and well below what we saw in the higher-cost Q1 quarter. The Q3 cost figures are at the low end of the revised annual cost guidance ranges.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The combination of a very strong gold price and good cost control led to a record AISC margin of $1,984/oz in Q3, even though the company sold 12,346 ounces into the gold prepayment facility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1036\" data-height=\"446\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 4 - Source: Alamos Gold Quarterly Reports\" width=\"640\" height=\"276\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-1761778569600013_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 4 - Source: Alamos Gold Quarterly Reports</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"933\" data-height=\"507\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 5 - Source: Alamos Gold Quarterly Reports\" width=\"640\" height=\"348\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617785921839578_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 5 - Source: Alamos Gold Quarterly Reports</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alamos Gold reported a slight decrease in production quarter-over-quarter for Young-Davidson, while the Island Gold District saw production increase by 4% and the Mulatos District production increased as much as 9% quarter-over-quarter.

The liquidity from the Turkish asset sale has further strengthened the balance sheet after that deal closed in early Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alamos Gold pays a quarterly dividend of $0.025, which equates to a dividend yield of 0.3%. With a growing cash balance, despite its growth investments, the company opened up for utilizing its buybacks in the Q3 result. There is likely plenty of room for buybacks if the strong gold price environment persists.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>the Company expects to reduce existing debt obligations, and will assess opportunities to be active on its share buyback</em></p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a lot to like about Alamos Gold. This is a quality producer, with most of its assets in Canada, and the growth profile is very attractive. The phase 3+ project at Island Gold is set to come online in the second half of 2026, which will both increase production out of Island Gold and lower the operating cost of that asset.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The phase 3+ project accounts for all the expected production growth in 2026 and 2027 for the company. Given that Island Gold is already today the lowest cost mine for Alamos, growing that production and decreasing the mine-site cost will lead to substantially lower consolidated costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Later this decade, we have Lynn Lake and likely also another growth project at Island Gold to take the annual gold production above 1Moz, which will be transformational for Alamos Gold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"984\" data-height=\"595\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 8 - Source: Alamos Gold Quarterly Reports &amp; Press Releases\" width=\"640\" height=\"387\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48701869-17617798736531591_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 8 - Source: Alamos Gold Quarterly Reports &amp; Press Releases</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The gold price has averaged around $3,300/oz in 2025 and if we use that to estimate the cash flow over the coming years, the cash flow projections look something like the chart below.

However, if we only use sustaining capex, the free cash flow yield is 7-8% over the coming year, which is in my view a very attractive valuation for this quality gold mining company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The max drawdown for Alamos has been 23% over the last 3 years and we also consider that the stock has lagged the GDX this year, I think the current 15-20% drawdown is an attractive buying opportunity. We would likely need to see a more pronounced gold price decline or operations to stumble substantially for Alamos Gold to see a larger 25+% drawdown.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, based on after hours price action yesterday, Alamos Gold might decline today, which is understandable following a downward revised production guidance. I have been increasing my exposure following the recent correction in Alamos Gold and I expect to buy more if we see further downside. I rate Alamos Gold as a buy at this level.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2400\" data-height=\"1240\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 10 - Source: Koyfin\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48701869-17618109577677138_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 10 - Source: Koyfin</span></p></figcaption></figure></p>",

On a 5-year chart, the stock has declined by 83%, highlighting a significant drop in investor sentiment. The trend of underperformance continues, but I argue that the market overlooks its potential. With robust performance and AI-tailored tools, the communication company appears to be well-positioned for a turnaround story, and I think the market may reprice Zoom at a higher multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I rate Zoom Communications a Strong Buy with a $118 price target, presenting a 38% upside possibility, and broader market outperformance. I think the multi-year sell-off appears overdone, and with AI-driven solutions, the company may reshape the way we work today. I believe it may be a compelling opportunity for long-term investors who favor technology names trading at undervalued levels.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FQ2 2026 Snapshot: Steady Top And Bottom Line Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On August 21, the company posted <a href=\"https://investors.zoom.us/news-releases/news-release-details/zoom-communications-reports-financial-results-second-quarter\" rel=\"nofollow\">FQ2 2026</a> results. This was a double-beat quarter for the company, underlining a high demand and business strength. The market reacted with roughly a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZM/historical-price-quotes\">13% stock price appreciation</a> over the following trading day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company delivered $1.22 billion in revenue, reflecting a 4% increase on a year-over-year basis, and nearly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZM/earnings\">$19 million</a> above the analysts' estimates (a 1.5% surprise). The bottom line arrived at $1.53 in diluted EPS, nearly 10% growth versus $1.39 in the same quarter last year, and $0.15 higher than the market had anticipated (about a 10% surprise).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617199583463423_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1900\" data-height=\"1062\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617199583463423_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ZM: FQ2 2026 Top-Line Results\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617199583463423_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617199583463423_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617199583463423_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617199583463423_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617199583463423_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617199583463423_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617199583463423_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617199583463423_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ZM: FQ2 2026 Top-Line Results <span>(Zoom Communications Investor Relations)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management highlighted that it has achieved a 9% customer growth with over $100,000 in TTM revenue on a year-over-year basis. This indicates that Zoom offers high-quality products and services, leading to a sticky customer base and highly contributing to a bullish future outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company experienced a 128 bps increase on a YoY basis in gross profit margin (non-GAAP), reaching 79.8%. In parallel, it managed to reduce S&amp;M expenses by 101 bps to 22.3%, making it a more operationally efficient business. This is a favorable trend for investors, as it indicates that Zoom highly focuses on both top and bottom line growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617201757815778_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1888\" data-height=\"1060\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617201757815778_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ZM: FQ2 2026 Expenses And Margins\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617201757815778_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617201757815778_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617201757815778_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617201757815778_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617201757815778_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617201757815778_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617201757815778_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617201757815778_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ZM: FQ2 2026 Expenses And Margins <span>(Zoom Communications Investor Relations)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In their <a href=\"https://investors.zoom.us/static-files/cfbef369-7f70-46a0-a40f-bfabb35515e2\" rel=\"nofollow\">presentation</a>, management underscored that it has achieved $516 million in operating cash flow and $508 million in free cash flow. Nevertheless, it continues a shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy with a share repurchase program. The communications company bought back 6 million shares in FQ2 alone, equaling about $463 million. This heavily contributes to the company's bullish narrative and fuels the thesis of bottom-line growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617203750320215_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1906\" data-height=\"1068\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617203750320215_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ZM: FQ2 2026 Cash Flow And BuyBacks\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617203750320215_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617203750320215_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617203750320215_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617203750320215_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617203750320215_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617203750320215_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617203750320215_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617203750320215_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ZM: FQ2 2026 Cash Flow And <span></span>Buybacks <span>(Zoom Communications Investor Relations)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is anticipated to report <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZM/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly\">FQ3 2026 results</a> over the following few weeks. I think that if management continues to deliver, it may be a turnaround quarter, leading to a broader market outperformance in the years ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wall Street forecasts that the company will deliver $1.21 billion in revenue, implying roughly a 3% growth on a year-over-year basis. The market estimates $1.44 in diluted EPS, reflecting 4% growth over the past year. This is roughly in line with my projections, highlighting continued top- and bottom-line growth. To that, in their previous presentation, management delivered <a href=\"https://investors.zoom.us/static-files/cfbef369-7f70-46a0-a40f-bfabb35515e2\" rel=\"nofollow\">guidance for this upcoming quarter,</a> and it falls roughly in line with the market's beliefs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I think that Zoom is positioning itself as a technology disruptor, enabling a more efficient way to work. For instance, on October 9, the company announced that its <a href=\"https://investors.zoom.us/news-releases/news-release-details/zoom-phone-hits-10-million-seats-transforming-how-businesses\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zoom Phone has reached 10 million seats</a> globally, transforming business communications. It redefines what connected and intelligent communications may look like in modern workplaces.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its other <a href=\"https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/introducing-zoom-communications-inc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AI-centric Zoom Workplace tools</a> may act as digital assistants, for instance, summarizing meetings, drafting email responses, or helping to prepare for daily tasks, and gradually appear to become a must-have, rather than a nice-to-have tool. I think Zoom offers an interesting opportunity in the AI-tailored modern workplace, and I argue that the market has not priced that in yet.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Undervalued AI-Tailored Tech Play, Offering Exciting Future, Above-Market Margins</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The communications company appears to be trading at a<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZM/valuation/metrics\"> forward P/E of 14.45</a>, which indicates a roughly 79% undervaluation versus the sector median of 25.84, and about a 65% discount compared to the average company in the S&amp;P500 at a <a href=\"https://en.macromicro.me/series/20052/sp500-forward-pe-ratio\" rel=\"nofollow\">23.62 earnings multiple</a>.

This supports a bullish narrative and reflects undervaluation. On the other hand, the forward EV/Sales and Price/Sales ratios of 3.68 and 5.28, respectively, imply that the stock may be fairly valued, or even slightly overvalued, compared to the industry's average of 3.64 and 3.62, representing about a 20% premium at the midpoint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These metrics also indicate that the market anticipates revenue growth in the years ahead. However, although I think investors may have already partially priced in low single-digit top-line growth, if management can resume double-digit revenue expansion, I believe the company could trade at a substantially higher premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617233718240275_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"869\" data-height=\"220\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617233718240275_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ZM: Capital Structure\" width=\"640\" height=\"162\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617233718240275_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617233718240275_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617233718240275_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617233718240275_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617233718240275_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617233718240275_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617233718240275_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617233718240275_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ZM: Capital Structure <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zoom Communications appears to be financially healthy. It has a low-leverage capital structure, reflecting only <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZM/valuation/capital-structure\">$54 million</a> in total obligations. ZM has about $7.78 billion in cash and could pay its debt with ease. To that, it represents that the technology company is well-positioned to operate in the high-interest-rate environment, as it remains low-leveraged. I argue that such a robust balance sheet may be rewarded with a higher multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has been a steadily growing top- and bottom-line story, so far. Although the business expansion remains single-digit, I think the AI-tailored company could accelerate the growth in the years ahead, supported by its innovations and AI-driven solutions. Nevertheless, the top-line rose by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZM/growth\">3.63%</a> over the past 12 months, which implies about 2x underperformance versus peers of 7.31%. On the upside, the diluted EPS grew roughly 36% over the past year, fueling a bullish outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ZM operates at substantially above-market margins, and I think that is a significant argument for its stock price appreciation. This also suggests that the business is highly profitable. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZM/profitability\">Gross profit margin (TTM) of 76%</a> underscores about a 54% advantage versus the sector median of roughly 50%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-1761724637521424.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ZM: Net Income (TTM)\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"623\" height=\"414\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-1761724637521424.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-1761724637521424.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-1761724637521424.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-1761724637521424.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-1761724637521424.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-1761724637521424.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-1761724637521424.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-1761724637521424.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ZM: Net Income (TTM) <span>(YCharts)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The net income margin (TTM) of 25% highlights about 5x outperformance versus the sector median of 4.58%. This is a significant advantage, which argues for a higher multiple. Furthermore, the company generated $1.91 billion in cash from operations (TTM), approximately 15x the premium versus peers of only $122 million. These are exceptional results, supporting my thesis that Zoom appears to be a highly profitable company with a promising future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, this is an interesting opportunity for long-term investors, presenting an undervalued technology name that heavily focuses on AI enhancements and has a low-leverage capital structure, and that operates at substantially higher than market margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wall Street anticipates <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZM/earnings/estimates\">$5.92</a> in diluted EPS for fiscal FY2027. This would represent a low single-digit growth from a current bottom-line result of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZM/earnings/estimates\">$5.75 on a TTM basis</a>. I think this is a reasonable estimate, and may be too conservative, based on the future tailwinds, driven by a strong demand for AI products. Nevertheless, I believe that a shift to a must-have AI-tailored solution may encourage the market to rethink the thesis around Zoom. This could boost investor confidence, sentiment, and reprice the stock at a higher multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we apply a 20x earnings multiple to a fiscal FY2027 EPS estimate of $5.92, we arrive at my price target of about $118 over the next year. This would still be roughly 20% below the average company in the S&amp;P500, and nearly a 30% discount to peers, signaling underperformance. Given its tailwinds, I think Zoom appears to be well-positioned to rebound from such oversold levels.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Main Risks And Concerns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are risks and concerns tied to Zoom, which could meaningfully impact stock price performance in the near term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the market views Zoom as simply a communication platform, which could take time to change. The company disrupted the communication space several years ago, and it may have stuck with investors that this was their only focus area. However, now with AI-tailored solutions in place, Zoom redefines an optimized way to work. Nevertheless, I think it may take time for the market to rethink its thesis, and that could stress the stock further.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the company continues to grow revenue, a low single-digit performance appears insignificant. If the company continues to struggle to accelerate top-line expansion, I think it could continue trading at a substantial discount to both peers and the benchmark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The technology market is fierce. The company is competing against well-known companies, such as Microsoft, and that could weigh on the stock. If the market thinks the company can lose its market share to competition, the trend of underperformance may continue further.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regardless, if none of the above risks and concerns materialize, the company could experience a shift in sentiment, followed by significant stock price appreciation. I think that its AI-tailored solutions could disrupt the way we work, and the market may rethink its thesis about the company, rewarding it with a higher premium.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Zoom Appears To Be An Undervalued AI-Tech Company And Well-Positioned For Turnaround</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe Zoom Communications may appear to be a compelling opportunity for long-term investors who may seek to increase exposure to an AI-driven technology name, trading at undervalued levels. ZM is not only a communication platform anymore; it offers workplace optimization solutions and AI-driven digital assistance services, which could reshape the way we work.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company continues growing its top and bottom line, remains a low-leverage business, and operates at substantial margins. That could fuel a bullish narrative in the years ahead. Although it operates in the fierce technology market and faces revenue growth headwinds, I think it is well-positioned to compete with others and accelerate its growth story.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe the company may have what it takes to rebound from these oversold levels, although there are reasons it trades at such an earnings multiple. Nevertheless, I rate Zoom Communications as a Strong Buy with a $118 price target over the next 12 months, implying a 38% upside possibility. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZM/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">31 Wall Street analysts</a> forecast a $93 price target, representing a 9% upside possibility. This is definitely a possibility, especially if the market continues viewing Zoom as a pure communications play.</p>",

The central bank reduced its target federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3-3/4 to 4 percent. While<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> Jerome Powell indicated at the press conference that the Fed is not on a predetermined path, the committee did </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4823854-federal-reserve-resumes-rate-cuts-extends-inflation-runway\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">cut rates halfway to September’s year-end estimate</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">. Unless new data shows an adverse rise to inflation, I believe the Fed is set to follow through with one more rate cut in 2025 with great policy uncertainty for 2026.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Revisiting the Fed’s Expectations</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve’s restarting of interest rates can be dated back to Jackson Hole. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4816284-jackson-hole-investors-missed-powells-note-about-the-neutral-interest-rate\">In his speech</a>, Chairman Powell acknowledged that the labor market had weakened to a point that interest rate cuts were necessary. Fast forward to September, when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 basis points and projected an additional 50 basis points of rate reductions between then and the end of the year. By cutting rates by 25 basis points today, the Fed is only one cut away from hitting its target for 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617798275596237_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2065\" data-height=\"1279\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617798275596237_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Fed 2025 Fed Funds Rate Projection\" width=\"640\" height=\"396\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"396\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617798275596237_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617798275596237_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617798275596237_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617798275596237_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617798275596237_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617798275596237_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617798275596237_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617798275596237_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Federal Reserve September Economic Projections</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While some Fed observers (me included) cautioned against lowering rates in an inflationary environment, the Federal Reserve has communicated its tolerance for near-term inflation to be above their long-term target to support the labor market.

One Federal Reserve board member dissented, wanting instead for the committee to cut interest rates by 50 basis points. The other dissenting Federal Reserve board member wanted no cut. It's becoming clear that the committee may be splitting between inflation hawks and employment hawks, with the absence of data risking driving that division deeper.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The end of quantitative easing is also another highlight from this meeting that many investors expected to hear. The Federal Reserve will stop selling Treasury securities on December 1<sup>st</sup>. The move is not surprising, as the amount of liquidity in the financial system, measured through the overnight repo facility, had been waning in the period leading to the meeting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617801407806041_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1698\" data-height=\"695\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617801407806041_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Overnight Reverse Repo 1 Year History\" width=\"640\" height=\"262\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"262\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617801407806041_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617801407806041_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617801407806041_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617801407806041_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617801407806041_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617801407806041_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617801407806041_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/20858741-17617801407806041_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Federal Reserve</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Why December’s Meeting Becomes So Important</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The December meeting is next on the Fed’s schedule, and it’s one I’ll be watching carefully. I don’t expect the Fed to deviate from its 25-basis-point projected cut, but I will be carefully monitoring the newest economic estimates being released at that time. With the possibility of the government shutdown prolonging and creating the absence of data, the Fed may be hard-pressed to commit to any policy direction in 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Chairman Powell states there is no guaranteed path, there is no reason to believe we’ll have solid data to move away from the Federal Reserve’s current rate path by December. Beyond December, I believe the Federal Reserve will regret this series of cuts, and inflation will return to create significant policy uncertainty. With equity markets at frothy valuations, I’m valuing the cash position in my portfolio and looking to build it in the coming months.</p>",

Moreover, the lower federal funds rate should reduce some of the strain on borrowers with rates indexed to short-term interest rates, while incentivizing people to spend more rather than save, since savings interest rates will also likely fall in tandem. However, the long-term interest rate picture remains much murkier, which challenges the notion that rate cuts are a tailwind for much of the stock market.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this article, we will detail what the latest FOMC meeting means for the market as a whole and share where we are finding attractive opportunities right now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Divided Fed And A Conflicted Economy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In its meeting, the FOMC acknowledged that the jobs market has weakened some this year, citing that:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>job gains have slowed this year and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low. </em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>inflation has moved up since earlier in the year and remained somewhat elevated.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This indicates that the Fed is facing tensions on both sides of its dual mandate: inflation is far from being beaten back, while the jobs market is increasingly appearing like it may need some support. This makes the decision to end quantitative tightening all the more controversial given that it will effectively enable the monetary supply to remain more stable even in a time when inflation remains elevated and the monetary supply still remains vastly inflated compared to where it was before the huge QE took place around COVID.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0a6bb9cfa77e3f831d164911246a7542.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0a6bb9cfa77e3f831d164911246a7542.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0a6bb9cfa77e3f831d164911246a7542.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0a6bb9cfa77e3f831d164911246a7542.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0a6bb9cfa77e3f831d164911246a7542.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0a6bb9cfa77e3f831d164911246a7542.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0a6bb9cfa77e3f831d164911246a7542.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0a6bb9cfa77e3f831d164911246a7542.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0a6bb9cfa77e3f831d164911246a7542.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The real headline of the day, though, was when Fed Chair Jerome Powell made clear that in December, another rate cut \"is not a foregone conclusion.\" The vote today, coming in at 10-2, including one voting for no cut at all, while the other wanted a more bullish 50-basis-point cut, shows that there was not even unanimous consensus behind the current rate cut. Therefore, the next FOMC vote for a cut could face materially more opposition. Not only that, but market liquidity conditions and market and mid-market spreads had been tightening, which was apparently one of the biggest driving factors for them to end their quantitative tightening practices despite inflation remaining elevated.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Implications For Stocks, Bonds, And Inflation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, what does this mean for the markets? Well, for the S&amp;P 500 (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR® S&amp;P 500® ETF\">SPY</a></span>) and NASDAQ (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust ETF\">QQQ</a></span>) , it means that there is yet another rate cut and the promise of quantitative tightening ending that should, in a vacuum, serve as tailwinds. That being said, given that both major indexes are increasingly being dominated by high-growth stocks that are investing aggressively in AI with uncertain timelines to achieving an attractive return on those investments, they are becoming increasingly interest-rate-sensitive vehicles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the Fed weakening its war on inflation through ending quantitative tightening and cutting short-term interest rates means that long-term interest rates may not actually come down much, especially given that inflation remains elevated and there remains plenty of pressure on the bond market from runaway budget deficits as well as the immense amounts of capital needed to invest in the huge AI buildout and re-industrialization of the U.S. This should mean that demand for bonds will remain under pressure, which means that the market will likely continue to be flooded by both corporate and government bond issuances.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that the market is <a href=\"https://currentmarketvaluation.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">significantly overvalued</a> based on numerous valuation models, a lack of relief on the long end of the curve will likely make the market increasingly focused on valuations, which could cause it to pull back sharply into correction territory due to a lack of rate relief on the long end of the curve. This will also likely serve as a headwind to fixed-income investments (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BND\" title=\"Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund ETF Shares\">BND</a>) because long-duration fixed income might not be getting the tailwind it would need to rally from falling long-term interest rates, while falling short-term interest rates make short-term fixed income and/or floating-rate debt instruments that much less attractive since the yield is declining on them.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sector Rotation: Value Over Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, given the increased interest rate sensitivity of the broader indexes that are increasingly weighted towards growth, I would expect higher-for-longer long-term interest rates to cause at least somewhat of a rotation towards value and dividend stocks, especially if they are ones that are somewhat stagflation-resistant, thereby enabling them to weather a higher inflation rate environment and are not particularly dependent on raising debt regularly from the capital markets. In particular, I like three segments right now:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Gold (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLD\" title=\"SPDR® Gold Shares ETF\">GLD</a>) And Silver (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLV\" title=\"iShares Silver Trust ETF\">SLV</a>) Bullion Leases: I like investing in gold and silver bullion leases because they give me full ownership of the underlying metal while also earning an attractive yield on those investments. This makes it not only an attractive source of passive income but also access to an investment that tends to do quite well when short-term interest rates fall since it makes gold a more attractive relative store of wealth when savings account and CD rates decline. Additionally, in an inflationary environment, gold also tends to do well over the long term, and silver often follows gold.</p></li> <li><p>Midstream Infrastructure (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMLP\" title=\"Alerian MLP ETF\">AMLP</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EPD\" title=\"Enterprise Products Partners L.P. Common Units\">EPD</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ET\" title=\"Energy Transfer LP Common Units\">ET</a>): I really like the midstream infrastructure space right now, as I detailed in a recent <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831472-midstream-now-my-highest-conviction-buy-after-gold-and-silver-big-run\">article</a>. This is because its balance sheets having never been stronger, which makes them resistant to higher-for-longer interest rate environments. Moreover, the inflation indexation in many of its contracts, as well as the fact that energy tends to do well in inflationary environments, positions it well for higher-for-longer inflation and long-term interest rate environments. Additionally, the highly contracted nature of the underlying assets makes it defensive, while the yields are sky-high, positioning the sector to shine even if the market sours on the major indexes due to their rich valuations. </p></li> <li><p>Quality Dividend Stocks: I like quality dividend stocks as seen in index funds and ETFs like the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHD\" title=\"Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF™\">SCHD</a>). Their strong dividend growth, fairly defensive nature, attractive yields, and significant current profits make them attractive alternatives to richly valued speculative longer-term profit propositions that many of the largest companies in the major indexes are faced with right now.</p></li> </ol> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investor Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the Fed's rate cut and end of quantitative tightening normally would be viewed as a tailwind for the market, the uncertain long-term path for rate cuts has thrown a cloud of uncertainty on the markets right now. This is because the Fed has said that inflation remains elevated, and while there are signs of cracks forming in the jobs market, balancing its dual mandate is very important. Therefore, long-term interest rates do not appear headed lower until inflation gets suppressed materially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This means that the recent bull run for the broader market may well be over, and instead, alternative places like precious metals bullion leases and other highly contracted investment-grade and dividend-paying infrastructure stocks and even a broadly diversified basket of high-quality defensive dividend growth stocks in ETFs like SCHD are looking like more attractive risk-adjusted alternatives. These are the types of opportunities, and in particular midstream and bullion leases, that we are loading up on in our portfolios right now at <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1369-high-yield-investor\" rel=\"noopener\">High Yield Investor</a>.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The same happened with silver but in reverse as the Comex came to rescue London. This data is ringing the alarm bells. Physical supplies are stretched and people are waking up to this fact. Both metals have entered a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4832059-technicals-recovering-from-2011-ptsd\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">much needed price correction</a>, but the fundamentals that drove the price spikes are very much at play.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom line, there is not enough physical silver and gold to satisfy global demand. The game of musical chairs has started and it is far from over. The silver squeeze may have been eased for now, but it’s only a matter of time before it resumes again in earnest. One day, there won’t be another vault halfway around the world that can come to the rescue for both gold and silver.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/comex-update-physical-markets-remain-under-pressure\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p>",

That matters because when we assess the relative health of the U.S. new home market, the primary data we employ is the Census Bureau's new residential sales data that tells us both the estimated number of new homes sold each month and the average price at which they sold. We multiply these figures together to produce an estimate of the total value of new homes sold within the U.S. each month. We then calculate the trailing twelve-month average to smooth out seasonal variation in the data, shifting it \"backward\" in time so it becomes more of a contemporary indicator of the trends being experienced by the new home market.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But if that government-compiled data is not available, does that mean we're dead in the water for producing that kind of analysis?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Don't be silly. As with most data the government publishes that's useful, there are alternative sources available from private sector sources that provide a similar window for looking into the state of the new home market. We're going to use one of those alternative sources to do that today, which will give us a different but still useful picture of the.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We've tapped <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/research/data/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener\">Zillow's monthly data</a> for new construction homes, which covers single-family residences and condominiums, which is based on sales data for this class of real estate from major metropolitan areas in the U.S., to produce a national figure. That's a subset of the data that's compiled in the Census Bureau's new residential sales data but should work to give us an idea of how the market is for the new construction homes in the markets that Zillow covers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And also for which it has sales data. Because Zillow obtains its data from state and local sources that are slower to report their monthly new home sales figures, it lags a bit behind the national and regional estimates of new home sales data reported by the Census Bureau. Zillow provided its first estimate for August 2025 just two weeks ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although Zillow has data extending back to January 2018, it has greatly expanded its coverage in recent years, which makes its older data less directly comparable to its more recent data. For our analysis, we'll focus on the period from January 2024 through August 2025 because this data is most similar in its scope of coverage to the data for August 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From here, we'll treat Zillow's data for new construction sales for single-family residences and condominiums just like the Census Bureau's new residential sales data for our analysis. The following charts present the U.S. new home <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_total-valuation-of-new-construction-202401-202508.png\" rel=\"noopener\">market capitalization</a>, the <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_number-of-new-construction-sales-202401-202508.png\" rel=\"noopener\">number of new construction sales</a>, and their <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_mean-sale-price-of-new-construction-202401-202508.png\" rel=\"noopener\">average sale prices</a> as measured by their time-shifted, trailing twelve-month averages from January 2024 through August 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_total-valuation-of-new-construction-202401-202508.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trailing Twelve Month Average New Home Sales Market Capitalization in the United States, January 2024 -

36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Starting with the chart showing the total valuation of new construction from January 2024 through August 2025, we'll start by noting August 2025's total valuation of $22.26 billion from Zillow's new construction is about 73% of our <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4825812-august-2025-new-home-sales-jump-possible-statistical-fluke\" rel=\"noopener\">initial estimate of $30.53 billion</a> for the total value of all new homes sold based on the U.S. Census Bureau's data in August 2025. That's large enough for Zillow's data to provide a good indication of the overall state of the U.S. new home market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The trend data, indicated by the time-shifted trailing twelve-month average (orange) in the chart, shows the new home market was largely flat from January 2024 through August 2024 but has been slowly falling off in the year since.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That mirrors similar trends for the number of new construction sales over the same period of time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The trend for the mean sale price of new construction shows a different pattern. Here, average sale prices rose from May 2024 through December 2024 but have fallen off in the months since. First slowly from December 2024 through May 2025, then more steeply.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That pattern indicates 2025 has been a difficult market for the builders of single-family homes and condominiums. Although they've been lowering prices since the end of 2024, it hasn't been enough to reverse the downtrend in the number of sales. A good portion of that problem has been tied up with elevated mortgage rates, which have made new homes less affordable than they would otherwise be had these interest rates been lower. The problem of unaffordability is harming the market for new homes. And by extension, Americans seeking to become new homeowners.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The analysis that falls out from using Zillow's data on new construction homes largely squares with the analysis we've been doing for years with the Census Bureau's new home sales figures. The government shutdown isn't an obstacle for reading the state of the U.S. new home market.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">References</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zillow.

This is a problem for an Income Investor.</p> <p>NEOS Gold High Income ETF (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IAUI\" title=\"NEOS Gold High Income ETF\">IAUI</a></span>) tries to solve this problem and transforms gold into a cash-generating instrument with<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> an options strategy. And it is interesting because it still follows the trend of gold which is an asset uncorrelated with other income assets such as bonds, securitizations and dividend-oriented stocks or Reits. This benefit costs in terms of a cap on the upside. I therefore wonder, will this weight have a strong impact on future performance? To tell the truth it might not be so impactful in my opinion, but allow me to explain better.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The characteristics to know</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund was created with the goal of generating high monthly income with <a href=\"https://neosfunds.com/iaui/\" rel=\"nofollow\">potential appreciation linked to the performance of gold</a> through active management (run by Garrett Paolella and Troy Cates). In return, the fund offers an expense ratio of 0.78%, not negligible at all and higher than other traditional investment solutions such as GLD and IAU. To this is added an equally significant bid/ask spread of 0.21%, which makes entering (and exiting) the fund quite expensive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"942\" data-height=\"245\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IAUI - expense grade\" width=\"640\" height=\"166\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IAUI - expense grade <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But as my kind colleagues from the financial advising section always remind me, if you look at the price you lose the quality (even if I think it’s a good slogan for sales, in the markets it’s not exactly always the case).

The sale of calls transforms part of gold’s potential upside into a monthly coupon flow. IAUI in fact has a distribution rate of 12.63% and a 30-day SEC yield of 2.13%. The distributed yield (12.63%) does not represent actual income but is largely a return of capital (90%). It does this to reduce the investor’s average tax cost, defer taxation, and maintain RIC status. This means that the final performance will depend heavily on the level of implied volatility on gold: the higher it is, the richer the premiums; the lower it is, the lower the returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike GLD/IAU, which instead will not always have a return positively correlated to volatility. In fact, in most cases there is an inverse correlation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1554\" data-height=\"509\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IAUI - GLD - IAU: total return\" width=\"640\" height=\"210\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IAUI - GLD - IAU: total return <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Allow me to explain why.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I expect</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To answer, I switch for a moment from IAUI to the options market on GLD.

At the same time, if the IV were reduced, the size of the premium collected would also contract, therefore the distribution.</p></li> <li><p>If the underlying collapses, IAUI would record the contraction on the price without limitations, as much as IAU. What would, however, (significantly) mitigate the fall would be the distribution, because presumably the volatility of the underlying would increase, and the covered call strategy would probably collect higher premiums.</p></li> </ol> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are some evident cons. IAUI is very expensive, and it presents a clear and transparent cap on the upside, on one of the most bought assets of the last years. At the same time, what is happening on the options market stimulates my appetite for this instrument: potentially, the explosion of volatility would accentuate the premiums collected by the management, which would imply competitive distributions. If at the same time, this generated a contraction in the exponential growth rate of the underlying, IAUI would become more competitive compared to the last quarter. An income investor could find in IAUI a cash flow alternative decorrelated from the classic coupon solutions (bond and securitizations) or equity (dividends and REITs), with a total return similar to that of gold.</p>",

When German Chancellor Friedrich Merz took office in May, he promised that all Germans would feel change and improvement by the summer. This morning’s first estimate of<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> German third-quarter GDP shows that this promise has not been fulfilled. In fact, the German economy just narrowly avoided a technical recession, as it stagnated in the third quarter, following a slightly upwardly revised contraction of -0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter (was -0.3% QoQ). On the year, the economy grew by 0.3%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">GDP details will only be released at the end of November, but available monthly data, as well as the statistical office’s press release, suggest that investments were a small growth driver, while exports and private consumption weighed on economic activity.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2025 is yet another year of stagnation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With today's GDP data and assuming no future revisions, the German economy is clearly headed towards another year of de facto stagnation. In fact, another quarter of stagnation would bring annual growth in 2025 to some 0.2%, keeping the size of the economy still below its late-2019 level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the excitement and enthusiasm sparked by Germany’s fiscal policy U-turn and its decision to invest significantly in infrastructure and defence this spring, the summer brought a rude awakening. The mood in Germany soured and optimism ground to a halt – and not just because of US tariffs or a stronger euro, both of which complicate matters for the export industry. In fact, German policymakers are apparently just now waking up to the painful reality that readers of our research have heard endlessly over the last five years. A reality in which Germany has lost international competitiveness as a result of long-term underinvestment, a portion of naivety and arrogance, and China's rise from export destination to system rival. Current fears of production stops in the German (automotive) industry as a result of Chinese export controls on microchips are one of too many reminders that German industry is no longer dictating the rules of the game and, instead, merely lies at the receiving end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another reason for the worsening mood in Germany is domestic politics. The hope that a new government and fiscal stimulus would finally lift the economy out of its prolonged stagnation seems to have faded. Why? The discussion around possible austerity measures undermines the psychological impact of the announced fiscal stimulus. The government’s decision to shift previously planned investments from the annual budget to special investment funds has also brought a whiff of creative accounting in German fiscal policy. These developments not only revive unpleasant memories of coalition infighting from the previous government but also risk dampening household and corporate spending and investment decisions.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">All hopes are still on fiscal stimulus</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s be clear: the scale of Germany’s announced fiscal stimulus – €500bn for infrastructure and a 'whatever it takes' stance on defence – remains significant. This money will eventually reach the economy. However, recent fiscal manoeuvres have increased the risk that the stimulus will be less impactful and slower to materialise than initially hoped. Add to this the well-known supply-side constraints, from a shortage of skilled labour and high material costs to bureaucratic hurdles, and it seems likely that infrastructure investments will boost the economy more in 2027 than in 2026. Defence spending, on the other hand, could still deliver a positive growth surprise. Beyond the diluted impact of fiscal stimulus, the government is still struggling to agree on the far-reaching reforms needed to structurally enhance Germany’s competitiveness. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has promised a 'Fall of Reforms.' So far, the government has not only failed to deliver but also appears stuck in a macroeconomic model rooted in the 20th century, lacking a clear plan to propel the German economy into the 21st century.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, autumn isn’t over yet, and recent weeks have seen new initiatives aimed at reducing bureaucracy and boosting digitalisation. And yes, it takes time for investments and reforms to translate into growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Europe's growth laggard</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, while other eurozone countries showed surprisingly strong growth, the German economy continues to lag behind. The country remains stuck in stagnation and only banking on fiscal stimulus to come to the rescue gets increasingly risky. The longer this stagnation lasts, the easier it is to surprise to the upside. However, to return as a real powerhouse, Germany quickly needs a coherent, longer-term strategy and less wishful thinking with full pockets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.
