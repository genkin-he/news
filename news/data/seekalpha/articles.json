Drastic Headcount Reduction</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Much of XYZ's tailwinds may be attributed to the management's drastic reduction in their <a href=\"https://s29.q4cdn.com/628966176/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-2025-Shareholder-Letter_Block.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">headcounts by -40%</a> along with the raised FY2026 gross profit/operating income guidance, with it signaling their confidence in delivering the accelerated, profitable growth trends through a notably leaner operation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The headcount reduction builds upon the ongoing reduction to:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/173595682\">10,205 employees in FY2025</a> (-10.2% YoY),</li> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/9585158\">11,372 employees in FY2024</a> (-12.4% YoY),</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">after the multi-year headcount expansion at</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/8346566\">12,985 employees in FY2023</a> (+4.4% YoY),</li> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/7267377\">12,428 employees in FY2022</a> (+45.8% YoY),</li> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/6249016\">8,521 employees in FY2021</a> (+55.5% YoY),</li> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/5386965\">5,477 employees in FY2020</a> (+42.8% YoY), and</li> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/4846124\">3,835 employees in FY2019</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/4376004\">+14.5% YoY</a>).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on the ongoing headcount expansion at a 6Y CAGR of +17.7% against their revenue growth at +31.3% over the same time period, it may appear that XYZ's planned headcount reduction may have been overly done indeed, given the growing headcounts' notable contribution to their top-line growth thus far.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is especially true when comparing XYZ's revenue per employee metric at $2.37M in FY2025 (+11.7% YoY) against its direct fintech peers, including:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Neo bank/investment - SoFi Technologies, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SOFI\" title=\"SoFi Technologies, Inc.\">SOFI</a>) at $591K in FY2025 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/159729837\">FY2025 revenues of $3.61B</a> and 6,100 employees),</li> <li>AI lending platform - Upstart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPST\" title=\"Upstart Holdings, Inc.\">UPST</a>) at $740K in FY2025 (based on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/151270725\">FY2025 revenues of $1.04B</a> and 1,405 employees),</li> <li>Neo bank - LendingClub Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LC\" title=\"LendingClub Corporation\">LC</a>) at $929K (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/155409111\">FY2025 revenues of $998.84M</a> and 1,075 employees),</li> <li>PSP/P2P/BNPL - PayPal Holdings, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PYPL\" title=\"PayPal Holdings, Inc.\">PYPL</a>) at $1.39M (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/140936153\">FY2025 revenues of $33.17B</a> and 23,800 employees), and</li> <li>BNPL - Affirm Holdings, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AFRM\" title=\"Affirm Holdings, Inc.\">AFRM</a>) at $1.45M in FY2025 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/10358654\">FY2025 revenues of $3.22B</a> and 2,206 employees),</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">with it apparent that XYZ's operations remain rather efficient thus far, albeit still a distance away from the supposed market leader in the financial market, <a href=\"https://www.ondeck.com/resources/revenue-per-employee-ranking\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">StoneX at $23.76M of revenue per employee</a> in early 2025, as reported by Ondeck in November 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, given the drastic headcount reduction of -40%, it goes without saying that XYZ is likely to report a notably higher metric at an estimated FY2026 sum of $4.45M per employee (+87.7% YoY), based on the consensus FY2026 revenue estimates of $26.75B (+10.5% YoY) and ~6,000 employees after reduction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that the revenue per employee metric \"is an important ratio that roughly measures how much money each <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenueperemployee.asp\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">employee generates for the company</a>,\" it goes without saying that the management appears determined to deliver their ambitious 2028 growth targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If anything, a similar cadence has been observed in Verizon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ\" title=\"Verizon Communications Inc.\">VZ</a>), as the new CEO also touts how “cost reductions will be<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834657-verizon-communications-inc-vz-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\"> a way of life</a> for us here” and the strategy is expected to fund their “significant investment” towards reclaiming their market leadership in the telecom segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These developments are unsurprising indeed, as observed in the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/u-s-companies-are-still-slashing-jobs-to-reverse-pandemic-hiring-boom-abf1b94e\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">market-wide layoffs</a> post-COVID-19 pandemic, significantly aided by the <a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/insights/articles/ai-adoption-accelerates-survey-find\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">productivity gains</a> during the ongoing AI boom.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. Raised FY2026 Guidance</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is also important to note that XYZ has already raised their FY2026 guidance, with the gross profit guidance of $12.2B (+18% YoY) and the adj. operating income guidance of $3.2B (+53.8% YoY), notably building upon the FY2025 levels of $10.36B (+17% YoY) and $2.08B (<a href=\"https://s29.q4cdn.com/628966176/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/Shareholder-Letter_Block-4Q24pdf.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">+29.1% YoY</a>), respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming that the fintech is able to sustain these growth rates, it is not overly aggressive to assume that they may also eventually achieve their 2028 growth targets previously offered in the 2025 Investors Day, with the projected:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>gross profit growth to <a href=\"https://block.xyz/documents/block-investor-day-2025-full-presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">$15.8B in FY2028</a>, expanding at a 3Y CAGR of +15.1%, and</li> <li>adj operating income growth to $4.6B in FY2028, expanding at a 3Y CAGR of +30.2%,</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">significantly aided by the likely to be reduced operating expenses from the drastic headcount reduction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Readers must also note the accretive impact from XYZ's ongoing share repurchases on its adj. EPS growth to $0.65 in FQ4<span></span> '25 (+38.2% YoY), thanks to -3.5% of its float already retired over the LTM and the richer adj. net income margins of 6.4% in FQ4<span></span> '25 (+1.4 points YoY).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722408609937572_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2491\" data-height=\"768\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722408609937572_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"XYZ Valuations\" width=\"640\" height=\"197\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"197\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722408609937572_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722408609937572_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722408609937572_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722408609937572_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">XYZ Valuations <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These reasons are also why I am of the opinion that XYZ still looks compelling at my estimated FY2026 P/E non-GAAP valuations of 17.46x, based on the current stock prices of $63.94 and the fintech's FY2026 adj EPS guidance of $3.66 (+54.4% YoY).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is especially since the management still expects to deliver adjusted EPS of $5.50 in FY2028, expanding at a 3Y CAGR of +32.3%, with the stock still cheap at my estimated 3Y PEG non-GAAP ratio of 0.54x against the 5Y mean of 2.28x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When comparing against the sector median of 1.01x and its direct fintech peers, including:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>UPST at 3Y PEG non-GAAP ratio of 0.42x (using the same methodology),</li> <li>AFRM at 0.44x,</li> <li>SOFI at 0.81x,</li> <li>LC at 0.21x, and</li> <li>PYPL at 1.27x,</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">it is apparent that XYZ has remained compellingly valued as a fintech stock for so long that the management is able to leverage their \"intelligence tools\" and \"significantly smaller team\" to successfully execute their 2028 growth target.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is especially since XYZ still reports a relatively decent balance sheet health at a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 0.06x in FY2025, compared to some of its peers, including AFRM at 1.50x, SOFI at -2.96x (more cash than debt), and PYPL at 0.06x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These underscore XYZ's ability to incrementally invest in their growth initiatives while directing much of their free cash flow generation of $2.42B (+17.4% YoY) towards future share retirement, with $5.3B still remaining in authorization.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. Return To Growth</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Much of XYZ's ability to deliver the aggressive 2028 targets is linked to their determination to return to growth, through:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>the expanded merchant network to drive higher user acquisition trends,</li> <li>the expanded lending and banking products to drive higher user engagement and cross-selling trends,</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">all of which are expected to drive improved monetization trends and higher Gross Payment Volumes [GPV] across both Cash App and Square.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The same has been observed in Cash App's Monthly Transacting Active growth to 59M in FQ4<span></span> '25 (+2M YoY) and Primary Banking Actives to 9.3M (+1.7M YoY), along with the growing Inflows Per Transacting Active at $1.41K (+11.9% YoY), as \"more customers bring their paychecks into Cash App.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The latter is important indeed, since \"these customers have generated nearly 10x the gross profit of peer-to-peer only actives,\" with it also triggering higher retention trends and spending volumes through the Cash App Card.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thanks to the tailwinds from the prior Fed rate cuts in late 2025, the fintech has also reported growing \"consumer lending origination volume by 50% year-over-year in 2025, while sustaining strong margins and healthy risk loss performance,\" as similarly reported by other lenders/BNPL players in the recent Q4<span></span> '25 earnings season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is on top of XYZ Square's growing GPV by +10% YoY, as their international expansion drives accelerated GPV growth by +25% YoY compared to the US at +7% YoY, aided by their expansion into the mid-market seller channels (&gt;$500K in annualized GPV).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Most importantly, despite the growth initiatives and the intensified R&amp;D efforts, the fintech has been able to report a notable expansion in their adjusted operating margins to 20% in FQ4<span></span> '25 (+3 points YoY) and to 20% in FY2025 as well (+2 points YoY), with it lending credence to their increasingly efficient operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The excellent Return On Investment [ROI] on their growth initiatives may also be why the market has rewarded the XYZ stock with the outsized double-digit rally post-FQ4<span></span> '25 earnings call, with the fintech seemingly on track to reverse their previously decelerating growth profile in FY2024/FY2025 while delivering the ambitious 2028 growth targets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>XYZ Remains A Great Buy Upon A Correction</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722407941221094_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1814\" data-height=\"887\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722407941221094_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"XYZ 8Y Stock Price\" width=\"640\" height=\"313\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"313\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722407941221094_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722407941221094_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722407941221094_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54998043-17722407941221094_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

While AWS growth continued to rebound, it still lagged growth seen in key competitors. Furthermore, North America sales weakness is concerning moving forward. While profitability looked quite strong for Q4, guidance for 2026 Q1 was soft in my view. Furthermore, with the valuation not particularly low, I would say that there is limited opportunity for investors. As a result, I have decided to stick with my hold rating for now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sales Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_6105ad925746f5764f3c51aa1eb92d8a.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_6105ad925746f5764f3c51aa1eb92d8a.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_6105ad925746f5764f3c51aa1eb92d8a.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_6105ad925746f5764f3c51aa1eb92d8a.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For 2025 Q4, Amazon reported top-line results that were slightly mixed on some aspects. The company generated total sales worth $213.4 billion, and while the growth rate of 14% isn't bad relative to what we have seen in the past few years, the acceleration <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/AMZN-Q3-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">from the previous quarter</a> was quite minimal. Furthermore, in constant currency terms, the sales growth rate was actually unchanged at 12%, and so momentum doesn't seem to be building at this point. Still, Amazon actually <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN/earnings\">beat expectations by $2.15 billion.</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-r paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722225538400953.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Sales Breakdown\" width=\"407\" height=\"426\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"407\" data-height=\"426\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722225538400953.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722225538400953.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Amazon Q4 Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other point of concern is the weakness and underperformance in their North America segment. <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Webslides_Q425.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">As you can see on the right,</a> the North America eCommerce segment is still by far their largest by net sales. In Q4, growth decelerated to 10% from the previous quarter's already quite sluggish 11% increase. Meanwhile, International sales growth accelerated both in reported and constant currency terms. This is clearly a demonstration of the erosion of consumer confidence that has happened in the United States as a result of tariffs and still quite sticky inflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, the company's strategic decision to continue pushing into pharmacy services is one that could help to drive growth in their North America segment moving forward. On Feb 11th, it was reported that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4550489-amazon-pharmacy-to-bring-same-day-delivery-to-4500-cities-in-2026\">Amazon is targeting same-day delivery</a> to 4,500 U.S. cities by the end of CY2026. This boosts Amazon's competitiveness in this space. Next, let's turn to a closer look at their all-important AWS segment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWS Growth Continues To Rebound</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-1772223156031851_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1009\" data-height=\"451\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-1772223156031851_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AWS\" width=\"640\" height=\"286\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"286\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-1772223156031851_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-1772223156031851_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-1772223156031851_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-1772223156031851_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Amazon Q4 Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The focus is, without a doubt, on AWS in this age of AI. There were some promising results in this key segment. For Q4, they reported net sales of $35.579 billion, and that represented growth of 24% YoY. This is a speedup of growth compared to Q3's 20% growth rate, and so there are signs that momentum is starting to pick up. It is not surprising that the cloud market share leader is growing slower than its largest competitors, but the gap in growth versus Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) and Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) may be a little bit unnerving.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In their most recent earnings report, <a href=\"https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/2025q4-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Cloud saw a 48% increase in revenues,</a> while <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2026-q2/press-release-webcast\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft Azure saw 39% growth.</a> Of course, AWS has a larger growth base, but if Amazon continues to lag other hyperscalers over the long run, there is a risk that it will lose its crown in cloud services. That said, they do seem to be making some meaningful moves that will help to drive better performance over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We'll talk about their CapEx a little later, but just a few days ago, Amazon announced that they will <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4555427-amazon-invests-12b-for-data-centers-in-louisiana-to-cater-cloud-ai-workload-demand\">invest $12 billion to build data centers</a> in Louisiana. As Ahmed Farhath of Seeking Alpha writes, \"Louisiana has become a hotbed for AI infrastructure projects due to significant tax benefits, low electricity rates, and a reliable power grid.\" Therefore, it seems that Amazon is making a good strategic decision and investment to boost the presence of AWS. While spending may scare off some investors, at this point, it really does seem that Amazon has to invest heavily in data centers to secure the long run success of AWS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just today (Feb 27th), it was confirmed by OpenAI that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558700-openai-confirms-110b-funding-round-with-50b-from-amazon-and-30b-from-nvidia-softbank\">Amazon would be investing $50 billion</a> into the company. In addition to the investment, it was also announced that OpenAI would deepen its commitment to using AWS. Moving forward, AWS will be \"the exclusive third-party cloud distribution provider for OpenAI Frontier, which enables organizations to build, deploy, and manage teams of AI agents.\" Furthermore, OpenAI will be consuming 2 GW of Trainium capacity. This is a big deal for AWS and for their Trainium chips in particular, as it is a vote of confidence that there is strong demand for Amazon's in-house chips. Moving forward, securing more deals like these will help AWS solidify its lead in cloud services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a whole, I would say that AWS is moving in the right direction. While growth still trails Google Cloud and Azure, they are seeing a good amount of re-acceleration in this key segment. Furthermore, as highlighted above, new data center investments and a deepening relationship with OpenAI are likely to drive AWS' performance in the long run.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability Better Than It Seems</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722251300544424_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"732\" data-height=\"400\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722251300544424_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Profitability\" width=\"640\" height=\"350\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722251300544424_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722251300544424_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722251300544424_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722251300544424_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the EPS growth rate was quite poor, as shown above, profitability is better than it seems. For the bottom line, Amazon reported an EPS of $1.95, just meeting expectations and representing a sluggish growth rate of 5% YoY. However, a steep increase in provision for income taxes was a major factor in these numbers. When looking at the true profitability of Amazon's operations, things weren't bad at all.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For operating income, they saw an 18% increase. This outpaces the top-line growth rate as a sign of good business efficiency. Furthermore, when excluding the three special charges listed in their earnings release, operating margin would have been even better. As a result, I believe profitability is not a major concern at this point.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">CapEx Soars</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722256814178987_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"993\" data-height=\"265\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722256814178987_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CapEx\" width=\"640\" height=\"171\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"171\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722256814178987_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722256814178987_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722256814178987_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722256814178987_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Amazon Q4 Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Above, the TTM numbers are shown for Amazon's cash flows and CapEx. As you can see, while operating cash flows have grown quite healthily, the company's capital spending has exploded. FCFs are clearly on a downtrend, and with the company announcing that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4548340-amazon-targets-200b-in-capital-expenditures-for-aws-and-signals-rapid-ai-driven-growth\">CapEx will be around $200 billion</a> for 2026, investors may have their doubts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, management is probably doing what's right for the company. AWS growth is lagging Azure and Google Cloud, and for them to maintain their CSP crown, they are going to have to spend. Investments in data centers and infrastructure are likely to drive shareholder value over time, but in the meantime, investors are going to have to sit with deteriorating FCFs and perhaps even negative FCFs at some point down the road.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook Is Soft</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For 2026 Q1, Amazon sees net sales growth in the range of 11% to 15%. At the midpoint, they're implying a modest growth slowdown from Q4's 14%. I wasn't overly impressed by the slight acceleration of growth in Q4 from Q3 levels, and so I would have to say that top line guidance for Q1 is a bit soft. Still, this was actually <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4548198-earnings-snapshot-amazon-beats-on-revenue-sees-200b-in-2026-capex\">above consensus expectations. </a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For operating income, they are expecting to see around $19 billion at the midpoint of their guidance range. This implies a growth rate of just 3% YoY. While the company did state that their estimate for operating income includes higher Amazon Leo costs for the scaling of that business, overall profitability may still be a bit shaky moving forward. As a whole, I'm unimpressed with Amazon's near-term outlook even if their strategic decisions and investments are beneficial for the long term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Not That Attractive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_3121cf3b5826a88e2681c78a701207cf.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_3121cf3b5826a88e2681c78a701207cf.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_3121cf3b5826a88e2681c78a701207cf.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_3121cf3b5826a88e2681c78a701207cf.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Amazon's forward P/E ratio has dipped so far in 2026, it is still above Microsoft's and Alphabet's. I believe this shows that Amazon stock is relatively unattractive right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For some context, Microsoft and Alphabet posted company-wide growth rates of 17% and 18%, respectively, in their most recent quarter. This outpaces the growth rate for Amazon. Furthermore, recall that AWS growth lags both Azure and Google Cloud by a large margin. Therefore, while there are obviously business model differences between the companies, Amazon seems to be rather expensive relative to where their fundamentals stand in the grand scheme of things.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, while strategic moves are justified, the near-term outlook is undesirable as per their guidance. In a recent article, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869138-microsoft-stock-buy-amid-software-meltdown-rating-upgrade\">I called Microsoft a strong buy,</a> but Amazon likely only remains a hold at this point.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon stock plunged post-earnings, and it's not that hard to see why. Their largest segment by sales, North America, is underperforming, and despite better AWS momentum, Azure and Google Cloud continue to take the spotlight. While developments like their pharmacy push and their OpenAI deal are positive, guidance shows that the outlook is unfavorable at least for the near term. As stated above, company-wide growth and cloud growth at Amazon trail both Microsoft and Alphabet, yet the valuation is higher. I believe this shows the risk/reward is not where investors want it to be, and so I have decided to maintain my hold rating on Amazon.</p>",

I think it’s safe to say that the slide was driven less by the 2025 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558466-emergent-biosolutions-outlines-720m-760m-2026-revenue-target-as-transformation-plan-advances\">results</a> but more by a major<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> negative reset in 2026 </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558755-emergent-biosolutions-plummets-weak-2026-revenue-guidance-q4-results\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">expectations</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">. Management guided to just $720 to $760 million in 2026 revenue, a range that was far below the roughly $1.0 billion level that analysts had been modelling. Elsewhere, management guided for adjusted EBITDA of $135 to $155 million, down from $205 million in 2025, alongside an expected return to a GAAP net loss. So overall, it didn’t make for great viewing, and the size of the expectations gap, not just the weaker fundamentals, which I’ll get to, is what really hurt the stock price. Now, I think the sheer size of the guidance told us that 2025 profitability was boosted by a pretty favourable mix and cost dynamics that will not repeat any time soon. The competitive pressure on naloxone, combined with the uneven government procurement, should weigh rather heavily on 2026. So overall, with lower revenue on the horizon and a sharp dip in profitability expected, I wouldn't be too bullish on Emergent shares, which now find themselves trading in the $8 range.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722598211696093_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"896\" data-height=\"501\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722598211696093_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722598211696093_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722598211696093_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722598211696093_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722598211696093_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span> Emergent BioSolutions Inc.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emergent showed us a much-improved <a href=\"https://investors.emergentbiosolutions.com/static-files/d6aacde1-b9f8-499a-ad23-6e9176e04e83\" rel=\"nofollow\">FY25</a> financial performance in 2025. We’re starting to see the impact of their multi-year turnaround strategy. Now, despite a steep 29% year-over-year decline in total revenue to $742.9 million, the company actually swung from a net loss of $190.6 million in 2024 to a net income of $52.6 million in 2025. This was, of course, mainly driven by some very aggressive cost controls. We also saw improved manufacturing efficiency and a far richer product mix. Gross margin managed to expand to 45%, up from 26%, while adjusted gross margin rose to 54%. It’s a nice reflection of lower production costs and the reduced restructuring and shutdown expenses. Elsewhere, adjusted EBITDA hit $205.0 million, up about 12% year over year, so it’s clear that profitability gains were not just accounting-driven but also operational. As for cash flow from operations, the company has $170.6 million and a decent reduction in leverage, of which a big chunk came from a voluntary $100 million debt repayment and share repurchases totalling $24.8 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597261428473_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"916\" data-height=\"512\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597261428473_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597261428473_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597261428473_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597261428473_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597261428473_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span> Emergent BioSolutions Inc.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for 4Q25, here’s where we see the real volatility that comes with Emergent’s revenue model. 4Q25 revenue fell about 24% to just $148.7 million, with the company reporting a net loss of $54.6 million. Now, this was mainly due to weaker naloxone sales and the overall timing of U.S. government and international medical countermeasure orders. In terms of naloxone, revenue has dropped 41% since generic competition has been piling on the pricing pressure. Also, smallpox MCM sales declined about 54% due to procurement timing. However, it’s worth mentioning that these declines were partially offset by a hefty 64% jump in anthrax MCM revenue. This goes to show just how important government-driven contract cycles are in quarterly performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722596279198217_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"913\" data-height=\"493\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722596279198217_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"346\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722596279198217_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722596279198217_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722596279198217_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722596279198217_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span> Emergent BioSolutions Inc.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other segment results also show us a lot of divergence, with Commercial Products margins collapsing to 6% in 4Q25, again a result of the pricing pressure. Elsewhere, MCM Products' margins expanded to 44% with the help of some higher-margin products and favourable manufacturing variances. You can see the revenue compressions compared to last year in the chart below. As for guidance, we can expect much lower profitability in 2026, which is another thing investors wouldn’t have been too happy about on the call. Management guided for lower adjusted EBITDA in the range of $135 to $155 million and a return to a GAAP net loss. So that would suggest the 2025 strength benefited from the unusually favourable cost and mix dynamics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597588631678_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"919\" data-height=\"491\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597588631678_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"342\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597588631678_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597588631678_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597588631678_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/63097563-17722597588631678_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span> Emergent BioSolutions Inc.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Competition on naloxone</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the big points on the call and also a trend we’ve been seeing in 2025 was the pressure on naloxone. There’s been massive competition and also some unpredictable government buying patterns, which haven’t helped. If we take these together, they would account for a lot of the conservatism in the 2026 guidance. On the competitive side of things, the U.S. naloxone market has shifted quite rapidly since the OTC conversion. There are now multiple low-cost generic and even store-brand versions entering retail channels. Management actually warned that anticipated price adjustments will more than likely offset volume growth in 2026, which is never a good sign. It tells me that whilst unit demand remains rather strong, revenue per dose is falling simply because states, municipalities, and NGOs are prioritising cheaper alternatives. This is mainly why we’re seeing commercial revenue get guided to only flat to slightly up despite broader overdose-response funding trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, what also didn’t help is that government procurement is still highly uneven. You can see in the 2025 results. They benefited from an exceptional $60 million international customer order, but management doesn’t expect it to repeat in 2026. So this made somewhat of a built-in year-over-year headwind. In addition to this, the U.S. government shutdown caused some disruptions in 4Q24. We saw temporary reductions in NARCAN demand since public agencies delayed purchasing decisions. What this showed us is that naloxone volumes can be driven more by budget timing and even administrative processes rather than by end-user need, which we would rather see. We should also stay realistic and understand that naloxone demand is not actually collapsing, but it's the revenue contribution that’s becoming less predictable and lower-margin. Emergent to guide very conservatively on both top line and profitability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">One-time $60 million international MCM order</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think it’s worth touching on the loss of a one-time $60 million international MCM order, since it boosted 2025 results a lot. It also seems it won’t recur anytime soon. That order made up about 8% of FY25 total revenue, and materially helped out with margins and EBITDA. The FY26 revenue is now expected to fall between $720 and $760 million, and even the top end of the range implies that the underlying business is only flat to slightly down. Which I feel is due to stripping out this non-repeat contribution. You see, a large portion of 2025’s growth was actually opportunistic rather than structural, and the absence alone explains most of that year-over-year revenue decline embedded in guidance. It’s also set to contribute to the projected drop in adjusted EBITDA from $205 million in FY25 to $135 to $155 million in 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emergent, after this latest stock sell-off, now seems extremely discounted on a revenue-based <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EBS/valuation/metrics\">valuation</a>, especially given the company’s scale. They hold a market cap of about $583 million against a 2025 revenue figure of $742.9 million. The stock now trades at just 0.76x trailing sales and about 0.72x forward sales, which is a pretty steep discount to the healthcare sector median, nearing 3.7x. I find this particularly notable since they have specialised government-backed biodefense contracts and a gross margin profile that expanded to 45% in 2025. On an enterprise value basis, they trade at about 1.2x EV to sales and 4.3x EV to EBITDA, versus sector norms closer to 3.7x and 14x, respectively. So that would imply the market is assigning a hefty discount to Emergent’s durability of earnings and future revenue visibility, rather than its current operating performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So the way I see this is, despite appearing as optically cheap, the post-earnings valuation of Emergent now reflects a business that just reset its earnings power meaningfully lower. Not what investors would have wanted, but with that sharp reduction in 2026 revenue/EBITDA guidance, it has reframed 2025 as a peak year driven. The peak was driven by those one-off orders and unusually favourable cost dynamics rather than a sustainable run rate, which we would have preferred. So, to me, that means the market is no longer valuing Emergent on last year’s profitability but now on a structurally weaker forward profile. It also means naloxone pricing pressure, and that somewhat lumpy government procurement makes cash flows less predictable. If you look at it this way, the discount in the share price seems to be more like compensation for elevated uncertainty, especially around the durability of margins and future revenue visibility.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead<strong> </strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FY25 now looks more like a profitability high-water mark rather than a new baseline. Adjusted EBITDA hit $205 million last year, and what helped was that aggressive $140 million reduction in operating expenses. We also saw a 900 basis-point expansion in gross margin, but despite all this, management’s FY26 outlook of $135 to $155 million in EBITDA implies that most of those easily achievable cost savings have already been realised. So we can expect margins to be constrained by lower revenue/pricing pressure, particularly in naloxone.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other area I didn’t like seeing was the guidance for a return to GAAP net losses of $10 to $30 million this year. So non-cash charges, restructuring items, and legacy costs are still meaningful, and accounting profitability is still pretty fragile despite the turnaround narrative management has been giving us. Management also highlighted a capital allocation shift toward shareholders and some indication of balance sheet repair. We have to give them credit here since they did just announce the repurchase of 3.1 million shares and the <a href=\"https://investors.emergentbiosolutions.com/news-releases/news-release-details/emergent-biosolutions-announces-new-50-million-stock-repurchase\" rel=\"nofollow\">authorisation </a>of a new $50 million buyback program. They also had that $100 million voluntary term loan prepayment, which has left us with a year-end liquidity of $305 million. While these actions signal financial discipline and near-term confidence, they also raise more questions about prioritising financial engineering over reinvestment. And that’s at a time when EBITDA is projected to fall by roughly 25% to 35% year over year. If I take all this together—the peaking profitability, a return to GAAP losses, and a pivot toward buybacks rather than growth—I think the current setup gives me a cautious stance, leaving Emergent as a hold for me following this earnings report.</p>",

As a result, the BDC lowered its dividend by 10% to $0.45 per-share quarterly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the current<span></span> quarter's NII no longer being sufficient to support the $0.50 per-share dividend, and a dividend cut announced, I believe Morgan Stanley Direct Lending will suffer from weak investor sentiment for a while... which may very well lead to a higher NAV discount in the short term.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col span=\"5\"> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td> </td> <td><strong>Q3'24</strong></td> <td><strong>Q4'24</strong></td> <td><strong>Q1'25</strong></td> <td><strong>Q2'25</strong></td> <td><strong>Q3'25</strong></td> <td><strong>Growth Y/Y</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>NII Per-Share</td> <td>$0.57</td> <td>$0.52</td> <td>$0.50</td> <td>$0.50</td> <td>$0.49</td> <td>-14.0%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total Dividend</td> <td>$0.50</td> <td>$0.50</td> <td>$0.50</td> <td>$0.50</td> <td>$0.50</td> <td>0.0%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Coverage Ratio</td> <td>114.0%</td> <td>104.0%</td> <td>100.0%</td> <td>100.0%</td> <td>98.0%</td> <td>-14.0%</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: Author</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>10% dividend cut weighs on valuation, as do SaaS fears</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Morgan Stanley Direct Lending is currently priced at a 27% discount to net asset value, which makes the BDC much cheaper than shares of Ares Capital and Blackstone Secured Lending, which have NAV discounts of 7% and 12%. Both BDCs are top-rated, however, and have delivered strong results for shareholders over time, especially Ares Capital... which is why the BDC is still priced at a relatively high P/NAV ratio. My current rating on ARCC is hold: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4867013-ares-capital-stock-robust-10-percent-yield-for-trying-times\">A Robust 10% Yield For Trying Times</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I believe that the SaaS sell-off is completely exaggerated, as I explained <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874592-oaktree-specialty-lending-bdc-market-sell-off-likely-overdone-hold\">here</a>, I would currently not recommend investors buy the drop in Morgan Stanley Direct Lending because of the negative sentiment overhang following the 10% dividend cut. In addition, the investment firm's 700% increase in non-accruals makes me uneasy, and the high net asset value discount now visible in the market reflects this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the longer term, assuming SaaS concerns prove to be unfounded and the sector recovers, I can see MSDL revaluing to its 3-year average P/NAV ratio of 0.95X. As of the end of the fourth quarter, MSDL's net asset value stood at $20.26 per share, so a fair value for the BDC may be around $19.28 per-share... which reconciles to the historical P/NAV ratio. This fair value may only be realized, however, if the BDC manages to transition to higher asset quality (implying a lower non-performing loan ratio, at least below 1.0%) and if its dividend coverage profile gets restored to at least 100% going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_edc94c3f8a89c4196620b626cbc5f746.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_edc94c3f8a89c4196620b626cbc5f746.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_edc94c3f8a89c4196620b626cbc5f746.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_edc94c3f8a89c4196620b626cbc5f746.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks with Morgan Stanley Direct Lending</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MSDL has ~20% exposure to the SaaS and software sectors in its portfolio -- about on-par with other BDCs -- which in the perception of investors, has become a major risk, given the discussion about AI disruption lately. I believe AI and SaaS fears are exaggerated, and investors are likely well-advised to refrain from panic selling until actual evidence mounts that this is in fact the case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What would specifically change my opinion and my stock rating on Morgan Stanley Direct Lending is if the BDC were to see; 1) an increase in the non-accrual ratio above 2.0%, 2) a drop in the dividend coverage ratio below 100% for two or more consecutive quarters even after the dividend was cut, or 3) a significant increase in defaults in loans that the company has made to the SaaS/software industry.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All things considered, I believe the value proposition for Morgan Stanley Direct Lending has not improved that much in the last several weeks, despite a higher net asset value discount. Morgan Stanley Direct Lending did not fully support its dividend with net investment income, and the investment firm actually has seen a material increase in its non-accrual percentage. In my opinion, the 27% discount to net asset value reflects concerns about the firm's NII trajectory, dividend coverage, and balance sheet quality. While I don't see the dividend cut as a specific reason to downgrade or sell MSDL, a dividend reset it always disappointing and can be expected to weigh on investor sentiment for a while.</p>",

Sales volumes were significantly higher by 85% compared to the target of 350k.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-1772209239759065_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2332\" data-height=\"689\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-1772209239759065_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Uranium production and sales\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"189\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-1772209239759065_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-1772209239759065_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-1772209239759065_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-1772209239759065_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Uranium production and sales <span>(Source: Energy Fuels)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, uranium revenues rose by 27.3%. This is a complete reversal from my expectations last year, which had forecast a 56% drop in the number. Instead, the actuals came in 189% higher. This was for two reasons:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>At the time of these estimates, the midpoint sales guidance itself was lower at 250,000 pounds, which was subsequently revised upwards by 40%. And as earlier mentioned, the actual sales significantly exceeded even the upwardly revised guidance.</li> <li>Next, the realized uranium price assumption was USD 66.7 per pound, based on the price at that time. The actual figure was 11.2% higher at USD 74.2 per pound.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">...but heavy mineral sands affect revenues</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even then, though, total revenues contracted by 15.6% due to a pullback in revenues for heavy mineral sands, which represent the rare earths segment for Energy Fuels. Heavy mineral sands' revenue, dropped by 60% after the closure of the Kwale mine in Kenya in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The pullback in total revenue wasn't surprising, though, as my estimates had forecast a drop in uranium revenues. If anything, the extent of the drop was a relief. Even with an assumption of unchanged heavy mineral sands' revenues, a 27.6% drop in revenue was projected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With revenue weakness anticipated, I also pencilled in a loss in 2025, which also came to pass. In fact, the loss ballooned by 1.8x due to costs associated with the company's acquisition of the Australian rare earths producer Base Resources in late 2024, as well as expenses related to the company's expansion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Exceptional revenue growth to be seen in 2026</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenues in 2026, however, can look significantly better, based on the company's production and sales guidance as well as its recent acquisition of another rare earths producer, Australian Strategic Materials (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASMMF\" class=\"ticker-link\">OTCPK:ASMMF</a>). The details are below:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li> <strong>Robust production outlook for uranium:</strong> The production outlook for 2026 is robust, with a 31% increase in mined uranium and a much bigger 97% increase in processed uranium expected at the midpoint of the guidance ranges as provided (see table below). But the biggest increase is expected in sales, of 169%. Even if realised uranium price were to remain unchanged from 2025 and heavy mineral sands' revenues were to be nil, Energy Fuels would still see a near doubling in revenues from 2025.</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722092940245857_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2328\" data-height=\"547\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722092940245857_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Outlook, 2026\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"150\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722092940245857_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722092940245857_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722092940245857_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722092940245857_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Outlook, 2026 <span>(Source: Energy Fuels)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li> <strong>Expanding rare earths production potential:</strong> Next, there's the company's recent decision to acquire the rare earths producer Australian Strategic Materials through a share swap agreement plus a special dividend payout. This could add marginally to revenues as well, as Australian Strategic Materials has seen average annual revenues of USD 2.8 million over the past five years.</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, Energy Fuels' losses could increase even further in 2026, considering that Australian Strategic Materials' net losses have averaged USD 13.6 million annually over the past five years. For context, this amounts to ~16% of Energy Fuels' loss in 2025.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stronger longer-term prospects...</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking beyond this year, there are solid developments underway that can continue to support Energy Fuels' growth over the longer term, both from the perspective of rare earths and uranium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Russia and China hold dominant global positions in the supply of processed uranium and rare earths, respectively. With the US at loggerheads with both, ensuring security for these critical minerals has been underlined in recent times. Companies like Energy Fuels are well suited to make gains from this strategic development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It was already the biggest uranium producer in the US, and after its acquisition of Australian Strategic Materials, it has also become the biggest rare earths producer outside of China. While its rare earths' production is nil right now, the company aims to start producing dysprosium and terbium, both of which are restricted by China, in early 2027. Further, construction on the Vara Mada project in Madagascar, with <a href=\"https://www.mining.com/energy-fuels-estimates-1-8b-value-38-year-life-for-madagascar-mineral-sands-project/#:~:text=The%20Vara%20Mada%20project%20was,following%20refinements%20and%20further%20drilling.\" rel=\"nofollow\">promising financials</a> and a mine life of 38 years, is due to start in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the meantime, the company's uranium production can continue to benefit from the solid prospects as nuclear energy receives significant policy support and demand from big tech to power up their data centres.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">...but price run-up indicates stretched valuations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In financial terms, however, the extreme price run-up means that the stock is seeing stretched valuations. For 2026, my estimates indicate that the company can see a revenue of USD 130 million, which results in a forward P/S of 41.7x. This is much lower than the stock's five-year average forward ratio of 65.9x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the extreme price increase over the past year means that it's no longer a reliable indicator of what's next for the price. With uranium production and sales expected to be Energy Fuels' dominant focus in 2026, I compared how the stock stands against Cameco Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCJ\" title=\"Cameco Corporation\">CCJ</a>) instead. The big Canadian miner's forward P/S for this year is at a far smaller 20.2x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the company expected to turn profitable next year (see graphic below), over the longer term, the forward P/E is the relevant market multiple to consider. For 2029, analysts estimates on Seeking Alpha indicate a forward ratio of 51.9x. This, too, remains at least slightly high. For CCJ, the corresponding figure is at ~47x. I also compared it with the rare earths' producer MP Materials (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MP\" title=\"MP Materials Corp.\">MP</a>), which is at 27.2x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722529403635726_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2376\" data-height=\"893\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722529403635726_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Consensus EPS estimates\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"241\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722529403635726_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722529403635726_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722529403635726_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722529403635726_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's next?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Whichever way the valuations are considered, they look high right now. Of course, the company has projects underway, like Vara Mada, with promising estimates. But it will take a while to operationalise and the actuals could turn out different than current estimates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, there's a lot going for Energy Fuels right now. In terms of its critical minerals focus and its leading position as a US-based producer, it's in just the right position to reap the benefits of supportive policies. The company's latest production and sales numbers for uranium are only encouraging, and its outlook for 2026 is even more so.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The best course of action right now, would be to buy on any significant dips that reflect reduced market multiples. Otherwise, it's best to wait for more stability in financials before taking a call, especially for long-term investors. I'm retaining a Hold rating.</p>",

While the entire market sold off, the BDC sector got hammered extra hard and remained subdued for a longer time than the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then once everyone realized that actually the tariffs won’t have as drastic consequences as initially thought and the BDCs continued to deliver solid credit quality statistics, it took less than 4 months for the recovery process to get abrupted again. This time it was the bankruptcy of First Brands and Tricolor and the corresponding <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829881-jpmorgan-chase-and-co-jpm-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">“cockroach” phrase</a> that threw the BDCs back to square one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some months later, realizing that the promised cockroaches were somehow not emerging, the market initiated BDC recovery process again, which lasted until late January, 2026, when the SaaS aspect started to gain traction as a reason for BDC repricing. And here the dynamics at one of Blue Owl Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OWL\" title=\"Blue Owl Capital Inc.\">OWL</a>) private BDCs (OBDC II) came into play right around the same time, when SaaS selloff was at its peak moment. As a result of this combination, almost all BDCs plunged and entered into even steeper discount zones.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, the market is <a href=\"https://www.raymondjames.com/-/media/rj/dotcom/files/corporations-and-institutions/investment-banking/industry-insight/bdc_update.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">assuming</a> that about 23% of BDC NAVs (this includes the leverage effects) are effectively worthless.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The question becomes whether this time it is different. Could it be so that the BDC SaaS exposures (which are indeed material for many BDCs) fail and get converted to non-performing assets?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I doubt it because of the following (in no particular order):</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>In the Q4 earning call, the BDC management teams have all expressed no fears about SaaS investment blowout in their portfolios.</li> <li>The non-accrual levels of the BDCs that have so far reported their Q4 reports have remained rock-solid and in most cases the underlying companies have reported growing EBITDA generation levels.</li> <li>BDCs differ from broadly syndicated loan market as they typically implement strict underwriting standards, which come with conservative covenants and ample margin of safety (e.g., interest coverage levels at 2x+ and LTVs below 50%).</li> <li>The SaaS-driven non-accrual risk sounds like a broken record. It is only logical that BDCs go through cycles as they are inherently cyclical investments. And usually right at the cyclical lows, it is when bargain opportunities emerge that can warrant greater upside than just the offered dividend. This is what happened in the GFC, COVID-19, in 2022 when the interest rates were surging etc.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having said that, I fully appreciate the fact that for some investors venturing into BDCs at their cyclical lows when the risks are elevated and the future seems very uncertain might not be acceptable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, it could be so that the level of stress that would come with making BDC bets right would not compensate for the extra return potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, with this in mind, I would like to elaborate on two bulletproof BDCs, which could be bought right now, knowing that both portfolios and dividends are isolated from the SaaS-induced non-accruals.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2 durable NAV and safe dividend BDC picks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If I had to recommend two BDCs, which, in my view, offer the strongest level of protection from not only SaaS bankruptcies but also from a system-wide credit stress in the private credit space, I would go with Capital Southwest (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSWC\" title=\"Capital Southwest\">CSWC</a>) and Main Street Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAIN\" title=\"Main Street Capital Corporation\">MAIN</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It does not mean that these are my highest conviction buys from an attractive total return perspective, but certainly these would be picks that I could see in prudent retirement income investor's portfolio for whom a base dividend cut or a permanent value impairment is not an option.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me share four reasons, which should substantiate my stance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, it depends on a BDC, but many of the largest and well-known BDCs such as Sixth Street Specialty Lending (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLX\" title=\"Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc.\">TSLX</a>), Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BXSL\" title=\"Blackstone Secured Lending Fund.\">BXSL</a>) and Blue Owl Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OBDC\" title=\"Blue Owl Capital Corporation\">OBDC</a>) (but I could go on and on) carry meaningful exposures to SaaS sector. Typically, the portfolio bias towards SaaS is somewhere between 15% to 25%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, for both CSWC and MAIN the exposure to SaaS is below 5%. In CSWC's <a href=\"https://ir.capitalsouthwest.com/static-files/2fe3ecb1-cc82-4310-bce4-61b342d732f3\" rel=\"nofollow\">case</a> we cannot see it at a granular level, but given that it is not present in the Top 10 industry mix, which has 4% as the lowest mark, we can draw a conclusion that for CSWC the SaaS segment consumes less than 4% of the total book. For MAIN we can see this more clearly - i.e., SaaS accounts for ~2% of the LMM <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_2afe6f504d7c4121ebef0996b4c5e9e2/mainstcapital/db/396/11026/pdf/Q3+2025+MAIN+Investor+Presentation+v.ENDNOTES+-+vF+-+FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">loan book</a> and less than 8% of the private credit loan book (on a weighted average basis it translates to sub 4% exposure).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Already here we can basically neutralize the SaaS blowout risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, CSWC and MAIN invest with a strong margin of safety. The average portfolio company for these two BDCs has more robust leverage and interest coverage metrics than what we typically see for core middle market names.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, the weighted average leverage for CSWC portfolio company is only 3.6x, while the sector average falls closer to 4.5x. For MAIN's portfolio investments the leverage metric is even lower. And for example, the EBITDA to senior interest coverage is at 3.0x for MAIN's LMM investments, which means that the company would have to lose about two thirds of its EBITDA (business) to cause some real headache for the BDC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third, CSWC and MAIN are very well-positioned to expand their portfolios further, which should in turn result in incremental NII generation that could, in the worst case, be used to offset pressures from non-accruals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are two elements to take into account when thinking about growth capacities:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Additional borrowings. CSWC has a debt to equity of 1.08x, which is meaningfully below the sector average of 1.20x and a clear indicative of available debt capacity for growth in a financially prudent manner. For MAIN the debt load is much lower - i.e., debt to equity of 0.74x, which ranks it as the third lowest debt BDC out there.</li> <li>Fresh and accretive equity. Since CSWC and MAIN are internally managed BDCs and carry high-quality portfolios they trade at relatively healthy valuations, where the P/NAVs are above 1.0x. The presence of above NAV multiples enables accretive equity issuances that can provide capital for portfolio growth. Majority of BDCs do not have this (access to equity capital) available.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fourth, and this is also quite unique and important in the context of NAV stability and dividend durability, both BDCs could be deemed as equity-biased. Namely, the portfolios are saturated with high-quality equity investments, which can unlock further upside in the form of realized gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CSWC has 9.1% of its portfolio tied to high-quality equity investments. For MAIN the figure is even higher as the cumulative pre-tax net unrealized appreciation of its equity investments accounts for 11.7% of the total market cap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, the benefit of the equity tilt is that as these investments get monetized (happens periodically) they result in notable equity-like gains, which can balance out the headwinds from non-accruals or contribute to further NAV and dividend growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final words</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What we are currently seeing is yet another reminder that BDCs are cyclical instruments. When the sentiment shifts, they quickly drop into a deeply discounted zone, which is actually the right time to buy. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, going out in the market and scooping up discounted names, while the storm is still in the process is difficult. The risk of stepping into value traps is for sure higher than in normal times. Also, opening BDC positions right now might not necessarily be a stress-free exercise, which is also a critical aspect for many investors that I fully respect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So here I see a merit of buying CSWC and MAIN names, which still produce tangible dividends (11.5% by CSWC and 7.3% by MAIN) and are insulated from SaaS credit risks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this context, I would like to also insert the historical total return performance chart:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49926601-17721831774211764_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"743\" data-height=\"533\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49926601-17721831774211764_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Total returns\" width=\"640\" height=\"459\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"459\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49926601-17721831774211764_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49926601-17721831774211764_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49926601-17721831774211764_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49926601-17721831774211764_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ycharts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It really goes well in line with my thesis that MAIN and CSWC are indeed durable investment plays that have what it takes to withstand different cycles without value impairment.</p>",

BlackRock launched<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the fund in December 2007, and </span><a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/239627/ishares-msci-eafe-smallcap-etf\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">it has grown to $14 billion+ in net assets</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> — making it a dominant vehicle in the foreign small/mid-cap blend category by AUM. The fund’s benchmark is the MSCI EAFE Small Cap Index, and as a full-replication passive fund, BlackRock simply holds a proportionate share of the index constituents, rebalancing periodically in line with index changes.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After years of sluggish results, SCZ, and international equity's moment arrived. The fund posted a 32.10% NAV return in calendar year 2025, its strongest showing in recent memory, and is up approximately 9.06% year-to-date through February 23, 2026. International developed market equities have been the standout trade of the young year as investors rotate away from richly valued U.S. mega-cap growth names and toward markets with more attractive valuations and improving macro backdrops. On that front, I have no complaints about what SCZ is doing or where it invests. The issue is purely about cost — and in the passive ETF space, cost is ultimately the game.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SCZ’s benchmark, the <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/fact-sheet/scz-ishares-msci-eafe-small-cap-etf-fund-fact-sheet-en-us.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">MSCI EAFE Small Cap Index</a>, is a credible and well-constructed benchmark covering the small-cap segment of developed markets in Europe, Australasia, and the Far East. Passive investing here means the fund managers are not making active bets — they are tracking the index. But when a passive fund charges 0.40% to do something its competitors do just as well for 0.07% or 0.11%, you have to ask what you are actually paying for. I'll keep this fund as a hold - worth keeping an eye on but not the best option for international small-cap equity.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Breakdown</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SCZ was <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/fact-sheet/scz-ishares-msci-eafe-small-cap-etf-fund-fact-sheet-en-us.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">launched on December 10, 2007</a>, by BlackRock’s iShares platform. The fund currently holds <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/fact-sheet/scz-ishares-msci-eafe-small-cap-etf-fund-fact-sheet-en-us.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2,010 securities</a> as of December 31, 2025, making it one of the broadest portfolios in the category by holding count. This is a genuine differentiator — at the other end of the spectrum, actively managed foreign small-cap funds often hold 40 to 80 names, and even many passive peers hold fewer constituents. With the top 10 positions accounting for just 2.92% of total assets, no single company or sector event is going to materially impair the NAV. Morningstar recognized this quality, awarding the fund a Bronze medal rating as of April 2025. That said, the fund has struggled versus passive, cheaper indexes, and even after a strong 2025, the fund lagged the passive index by a few percent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721560896968758_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1512\" data-height=\"806\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721560896968758_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"s\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"341\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721560896968758_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721560896968758_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721560896968758_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721560896968758_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha Chart Tool</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a liquidity standpoint, SCZ is well-suited to institutional and retail investors alike, averaging approximately 1.27 million shares traded per day on NASDAQ. The fund’s scale and liquidity at $14 billion in net assets also provides tight bid-ask spreads relative to smaller ETFs in the space. I’ll acknowledge these are real attributes — and they do narrow the gap versus some cheaper but thinner alternatives. But for the vast majority of individual investors, funds like Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VSS\" title=\"Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index ETF\">VSS</a>) and Schwab International Small-Cap Equity ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHC\" title=\"Schwab International Small-Cap Equity ETF\">SCHC</a>) are both sufficiently liquid that SCZ’s liquidity premium does not justify the fee premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund employs a <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/fact-sheet/scz-ishares-msci-eafe-small-cap-etf-fund-fact-sheet-en-us.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">0.40% expense ratio</a>. For context, this is the same fee charged by many actively managed ETFs in the space, which at least have the justification of paying for a portfolio manager’s judgement. SCZ is entirely passive. When I compare it to VSS at 0.07% or SCHC at 0.11%, the math is straightforward: SCZ costs an investor roughly 29 to 33 basis points per year more, every year, for a nearly identical outcome. On a $100,000 investment compounded over 10 years, that fee gap represents roughly $3,000 to $3,500 in foregone wealth — money that stays with BlackRock rather than with you.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2026 Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The macro setup for international developed small-cap in 2026 is more constructive than it has been in years, and I want to be clear that I am bullish on the asset class — just not on SCZ specifically as the vehicle. The valuation gap between U.S. and international equities has widened to historically extreme levels over the past decade, and that gap has begun to close. A modestly weaker U.S. dollar, improving European fiscal outlooks, Japanese corporate governance reform, and better-than-expected domestic demand across the UK and Australia all support the EAFE small-cap recovery narrative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Small-cap equities in developed international markets carry a higher domestic revenue exposure than their large-cap peers, which provides meaningful insulation from cross-border tariff disruption. This is an important nuance in the current environment, where Trump tariff unpredictability has created noise around global trade flows. If you want international equity exposure that is less sensitive to U.S.-China trade tensions and more levered to local economic recovery stories, the EAFE small-cap universe is a logical place to be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, the January 2026 results were a reminder that SCZ is not always the sharpest tool even within its own category. The fund returned 5.4% in January, trailing the Foreign Small/Mid Blend category average of 6.2% for the month. Whether that is noise or a sign that VSS and SCHC’s slightly different index construction is producing better results remains to be seen, but it reinforces my view that SCZ is not even necessarily the best passive option in the space, let alone the best overall option. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Portfolio &amp; Risk Profile</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reviewing SCZ’s <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/fact-sheet/scz-ishares-msci-eafe-small-cap-etf-fund-fact-sheet-en-us.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">portfolio</a> as of December 31, 2025, the sector and geographic breakdown reflect what you would expect from a broad index of developed international small caps. Industrials lead at 22.76% of the fund, followed by Financials (12.72%), Consumer Discretionary (12.27%), Real Estate (11.12%), and Materials (10.88%). Information Technology accounts for just 9.13%, which is a far cry from its dominance in U.S. benchmarks. Investors coming from an S&amp;P 500 or Nasdaq-heavy portfolio will find SCZ’s sector mix genuinely different — and that diversification benefit is real.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721562105730858_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"829\" data-height=\"637\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721562105730858_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"scz\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"492\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721562105730858_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721562105730858_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721562105730858_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721562105730858_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SCZ Fund Facts as of Dec 31, 2025</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Geographically, Japan is the dominant weight at 35.09% of the fund, followed by the United Kingdom (12.60%), Australia (10.92%), Sweden (5.30%), and Israel (4.59%). The Japan concentration is notable and means that SCZ investors are implicitly making a significant bet on the Japanese macro story, including the Bank of Japan’s gradual monetary normalization and whether the corporate governance reform wave translates into sustained earnings improvement. This is a reasonable bet, but it is a concentrated one for a fund that markets itself on broad diversification.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a risk perspective, the fund has an <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/xnas/scz/risk\" rel=\"nofollow\">beta</a> of 1.09. The beta above 1 reflects the higher volatility though it is a portfolio diversification characteristic, not necessarily a sign that the fund is higher-risk in isolation. Additionally, the fund's 0.68 Sharpe ratio is underwhelming, as risk adjusted returns for other similar funds have been approaching 1, which is more palatable for investors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most significant fund-level risk is one I’ve already flagged: the fee. In a passive indexing context, the expense ratio is one of the only variables an investor can actually control, and paying 0.40% when comparable alternatives exist at 0.07% is a structural drag on compounded returns that never goes away. Every year you hold SCZ over VSS, you are handing back roughly 33 basis points to BlackRock for no incremental benefit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond fees, currency is the primary market-level risk. SCZ holds stocks denominated in yen, pounds, euros, Australian dollars, and Swedish krona, and USD-based investors bear this exposure in full without any hedging. A meaningful U.S. dollar strengthening — whether from tariff escalation, a hawkish Federal Reserve pivot, or a global flight to safety — would compress the fund’s USD-denominated returns even if underlying foreign stock prices were flat. This is a known and accepted feature of unhedged international ETFs, but it is a real source of short-term volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Japan’s 35% weighting is also a concentration risk that deserves mention. Any disorderly yen appreciation, JGB market volatility, or disappointment in Japan’s corporate governance reform trajectory could have an outsized impact on SCZ relative to peers with a different geographic mix. And on the macro side, tariff uncertainty, European fiscal headwinds, and the pace of global rate normalization all remain live risks for an asset class that is only just recovering its footing after years of underperformance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bottom line is that I like the asset class, but not the wrapper of SCZ. International developed small-cap equity is one of the better places to be in 2026, and SCZ’s strong 2025 performance and year-to-date gains reflect genuine fundamental improvement in the asset class rather than just momentum. The portfolio is well-diversified across 2,010 holdings, the fund is liquid, and the Morningstar Bronze rating provides some external validation of the fund’s quality.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But paying 0.40% for a passive index fund in 2026 is simply unnecessary. VSS at 0.07% and SCHC at 0.11% do the same job for a fraction of the cost, and that difference compounds into real money over a multi-year holding period. If you want international small-cap exposure — and there are good reasons to want it right now — there are more efficient vehicles to get it. For existing SCZ holders with significant embedded capital gains, holding makes sense and I am not suggesting you trigger a tax event to save 33 basis points annually. But for new money entering this asset class, I would not be starting with SCZ. I rate it a Hold.</p>",

The company boasts a strong balance sheet with significant flexibility and ever-growing dividends.</p> <p>I have written about several hospitality REITs previously, most recently on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4868425-sunstone-hotel-investors-strong-balance-sheet-great-management\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sunstone Hotel Investors</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHO\" title=\"Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">SHO</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">).

The hotels are diversified across luxury resorts, lifestyle resorts, urban lifestyle hotels, and urban gateway hotels, with their demand mix being fairly split among leisure transient (39%), business transient (27%), and group (35%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The portfolio is also well-diversified geographically, with Boston, Chicago, and New York City representing the largest market concentration at 13.3%, 12.5%, and 8.2% of EBITDA respectively. Apart from these 3 markets, no other market accounts for more than 7% of total EBITDA, which reduces concentration risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719973834230897_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"657\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719973834230897_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://investor.drhc.com/static-files/6b1cf418-fbe0-4508-a63d-00a189f1558b\" width=\"640\" height=\"447\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719973834230897_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719973834230897_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719973834230897_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719973834230897_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DRH Dec'25 Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A distinct difference between DiamondRock Hospitality Company and its peers in the hospitality industry is its predominantly third-party managed portfolio model. 23 of the company’s hotels, representing 56% of the total portfolio revenue, are managed by independent operators. This structure provides the company with greater control over expenses, capital expenditures, and cash flow. With contracts being short-term and terminable at will, there is significant flexibility to quickly test and implement profit-enhancing technologies, and decisions can be made specifically for each hotel's unique needs. In fact, the company’s third-party managed properties have consistently outperformed its brand-managed properties.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719974117358372_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"657\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719974117358372_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://investor.drhc.com/static-files/6b1cf418-fbe0-4508-a63d-00a189f1558b\" width=\"640\" height=\"447\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719974117358372_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719974117358372_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719974117358372_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719974117358372_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DRH Dec'25 Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance Sheet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In July 2025, the company successfully refinanced its senior unsecured credit facility, increasing it from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. The company used this additional amount to repay the existing mortgage loans secured by 2 of its properties. Subsequent to the repayment, and as of Q4 2025, the company’s total debt stands at $1.1 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.98%. This debt is comprised entirely of unsecured term loans, with the earliest maturity coming in January 2028, almost 2 years later. All debt is prepayable at any time without penalty, and the floating rate nature of the debt means the company stands to benefit from a declining rate environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719991238723252_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"659\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719991238723252_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://investor.drhc.com/static-files/6b1cf418-fbe0-4508-a63d-00a189f1558b\" width=\"640\" height=\"449\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719991238723252_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719991238723252_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719991238723252_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719991238723252_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DRH Dec'25 Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of Q4 2025, the company has liquidity of approximately $468 million, comprising $68.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $400 million from its undrawn revolving credit facility. This, coupled with the relatively long duration till its next maturity, means the company has substantial available capital to deploy strategically, or even for emergencies. Its portfolio is also fully unencumbered by secured debt, which does provide an additional option for the company to raise funds if necessary. The company has a net debt + preferred to EBITDA of approximately 3.5x, marking it on the lower end compared to its peers in the same space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One example of the flexibility the company has due to its strong balance sheet came in December 2025, when the company <a href=\"https://investor.drhc.com/static-files/d79bd41c-5cd8-4604-9d27-48f3e2491ac8\" rel=\"nofollow\">redeemed all 4.76 million shares</a> of its 8.250% Series A Preferred Stock for approximately $121.5 million cash on hand. This eliminates approximately $9.8 million in annual preferred dividends, and positively impacts the company’s Funds From Operations (FFO) by approximately $0.03/share. In all, this move has improved the company’s cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Dividends</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For 2025, DiamondRock Hospitality Company declared a <a href=\"https://investor.drhc.com/static-files/02e96b2b-394e-4b15-957d-6bce61e1a7ce\" rel=\"nofollow\">total dividend of $0.36/share</a>, comprising quarterly dividends of $0.08/share and a stub dividend of $0.04/share. The total dividend of $0.36/share represents a 12.5% increase over 2024. The company also stated that it expects to increase its quarterly dividend to $0.09/share for 2026, and possibly pay a stub dividend in Q4 2026 as well. Even excluding the stub dividend, this represents yet another 12.5% increase in the regular dividend, and gives the company a forward dividend yield of 3.6% at minimum (based on the current share price of $10/share).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A quick glance at the company’s Adjusted Funds From Operations (<span>AFFO</span>) shows that this current dividend is sustainable. AFFO for the year came in at $1.08/share, triple the total dividend of $0.36/share paid. Moreover, management has also indicated that the company will continue growing its dividends over the next few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/48026918-1772280483980978_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"741\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/48026918-1772280483980978_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://investor.drhc.com/static-files/aa83aff2-1fd1-4bf4-8f4e-b3c0b7b2a4e5\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"505\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/48026918-1772280483980978_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/48026918-1772280483980978_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/48026918-1772280483980978_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/48026918-1772280483980978_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DRH Q4'25 Earnings Release</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DiamondRock Hospitality Company is currently trading at approximately $10/share, significantly higher than its 52-week low of approximately $6.19/share, reflecting the market’s confidence in the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A look at the price targets from other analysts indicates that the company is currently fairly valued, with the average price target at $10.23/share, only slightly higher than the present value.

The company has meaningful EBITDA exposure to several host and surrounding markets, such as Boston, Florida, and New York City. Hotel bookings in the host cities have surged, which bodes well for the company’s 2026 performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apart from the World Cup, one of the most compelling advantages the company has is that there is negligible new supply affecting its portfolio. 29 of its 36 hotels have no competitive submarket supply under construction, with supply constraints expected to persist for several years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Potential Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As always, there are potential risks to consider. Firstly, macroeconomic sensitivity. As a hospitality REIT, the company’s performance is tied to economic conditions. There have been declines in leisure transient travel and international travel to the country, in part due to the current political and economic environment, including tariff-related uncertainty. Any recession or significant decline in consumer confidence would inevitably have a negative impact on the company’s performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk comes in the form of interest rate risk. With the bulk of the company’s debt being floating rate (70%, net of swaps), the company faces a substantial increase in interest expense should there be a rise in rates. For example, a 100 basis point increase would add approximately $7.7 million in annual interest expense, almost wiping out the savings from eliminating its preferred stock dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One last risk to consider would be that of valuation. As indicated above, the company is currently either fairly valued or slightly undervalued, with consensus price targets coming in around the company’s current share price. Moreover, the stock’s recovery from its low of $6.19/share means most of the near-term upside has been captured, and there is less margin for error.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DiamondRock Hospitality Company has a strengthened and fully unencumbered balance sheet, as well as a supply-insulated portfolio of hotels. Management has consistently sought (and succeeded) to increase free cash flow per share, and they have returned capital to shareholders in the form of increased dividends. While the stock is likely fairly valued at present, it represents a quality holding, and I rate it a “Buy.”</p>",

Based on the recent information, around 40% of private credit loans are extended to software companies, which are currently being disrupted by advanced AI tools. Thus, according to UBS, the default rate could be as high as 15% on these loans. Most importantly, large banks are heavily exposed because they lend to these private credit funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the bust in private credit is not sufficiently large to cause a systemic credit shock and the crisis like 2008 GFC - unless the labor market weakens. In this situation, a spike in the unemployment rate could burst the housing market bubble, the CRE bubble, and increase consumer loan defaults, which would likely trigger a financial crisis comparable to 2008.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, a stable labor market is now crucial in preventing contagion from the private credit crisis to the rest of the economy. The key issue here is whether AI adoption will cause massive layoffs - and the February labor market report could give us some clues.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Leading indicators for February</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The leading indicators for February point to a sluggish job creation, but still a tight labor market, consistent with consensus expectations. Thus, I don't expect any major surprises.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.pmi.spglobal.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/de7251a734954460986e49e0ab041b2f\" rel=\"nofollow\">The S&amp;P Global US Flash PMI</a> for February points to some weaknesses, which could be weather related. For service jobs, the report states:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Sluggish sales growth and concerns over rising costs led to a further month of very modest employment growth, albeit with some companies also reporting difficulties finding staff. Payrolls rose only marginally for a third successive month and at <strong>the weakest rate since last April</strong>. Hiring slowed to marginal rates in both manufacturing and services.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, for manufacturing jobs, the report states:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Employment came close to stalling amid the weaker demand environment, registering <strong>the smallest increase since last July</strong>.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The ADP Weekly jobs report actually points to a modest strengthening during the first week of February, with a slight increase in new jobs created, consisted with around 50-60K jobs created on a monthly basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/741147-17722128771091435_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"947\" data-height=\"327\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/741147-17722128771091435_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"jobs\" width=\"640\" height=\"221\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/741147-17722128771091435_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/741147-17722128771091435_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/741147-17722128771091435_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/741147-17722128771091435_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

Over the last 12 months, virtually all jobs have been created in Private Education and Health Services, with some in Leisure &amp; Hospitality. However, over the last 3 months there have been 65K jobs created in construction, and 105K jobs created in business and professional services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note, President Trump referenced 70K construction jobs created in his State of the Union address.

this will be evident in construction jobs.</li> <li>whether the AI adoption leads to massive layoffs - this will be evident in a cross-section of white-collar jobs, and most specifically in Computer System Design jobs, with macro implications as previously discussed.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Implications</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The financial markets are in a precarious state.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>First, there is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855212-the-ai-bubble-burst-phase-one-heres-whats-coming-next\">the AI bubble</a> where the ROI on AI capex is questioned.</li> <li>Second, there is the AI disruption, where AI adoption is making some industries obsolete, like the software industry, with the risk of massive layoffs.</li> <li>Third, there is a private credit crisis, where major banks are exposed.</li> <li>Fourth, there is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4873066-a-us-iran-war-could-trigger-a-global-recession\">an escalating geopolitical situation</a> with a possible US-Iran war, with implications on price of oil (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USO\" title=\"United States Oil Fund LP ETF\">USO</a>), and thus inflation.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The S&amp;P500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" class=\"ticker-link\">SP500</a>) is trading at Shiller PE above 40 - and that's a bubble comparable to the 2000 dot.com bubble.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As long as the labor market remains stable, the bubble can stay inflated, because investors will rotate from one sector to another keeping the (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Futures\">SPX</a></span>) index level price in the range -
