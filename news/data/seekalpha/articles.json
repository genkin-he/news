They are also an excellent way to \"mark your beliefs to market.\" In general, I go in order of long leading indicators, then short leading indicators, then coincident indicators.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Note on Methodology</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data is presented in a \"just the facts, ma'am\" format with a minimum of commentary so that bias is minimized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where relevant, I include 12-month highs and lows in the data in parentheses to the right. All data taken from St. Louis FRED unless otherwise linked.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A few items (e.g., Financial Conditions indexes, regional Fed indexes, stock prices, the yield curve) have their own metrics based on long-term studies of their behavior.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where data is seasonally adjusted, generally it is scored positively if it is within the top 1/3 of that range, negatively in the bottom 1/3, and neutrally in between. Where it is not seasonally adjusted, and there are seasonal issues, waiting for the YoY change to change sign will lag the turning point. Thus I make use of a convention: data is scored neutral if it is less than 1/2 as positive/negative as at its 12-month extreme.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With long leading indicators, which by definition turn at least 12 months before a turning point in the economy as a whole, there is an additional rule: data is automatically negative if, during an expansion, it has not made a new peak in the past year, with the sole exception that it is scored neutral if it is moving in the right direction and is close to making a new high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For all series where a graph is available, I have provided a link to where the relevant graph can be found.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recap of Monthly Reports</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Almost none of the normally scheduled official data was reported by the federal government this week. Both the Case Shiller and FHFA housing indexes rose on a seasonally adjusted basis, but remain below their peaks set at the beginning of spring. The Chicago region PMI by the ISM contracted again, but at a smaller rate. New orders and production showed improvement, while employment was poor.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Long leading indicators</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Interest rates and credit spreads </strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Rates</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>BAA corporate bond index 5.75%, up +0.08% w/w (1-yr range: 5.57-6.43).</li> <li>10-year Treasury bonds 4.10%, up +0.10% w/w (3.66-4.98).</li> <li>Credit spread 1.65%, down -0.02% w/w (1.36-2.02).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(Graph at <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=pAak\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moody's Seasoned Baa Corporate Bond Yield | FRED | St. Louis Fed</a>.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Yield curve</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>10 years minus 2 years: +0.50%, down -0.01% w/w (-1.07 - +0.55).</li> <li>10 years minus 3 months: +0.37%, up +0.23% w/w (-1.65 - 0.17).</li> <li>2-year minus Fed funds: -0.51%, up +0.23% w/w 3.56-4.33.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(Graph at <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=pAdn\" rel=\"nofollow\">10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus 2-Year Treasury Constant Maturity | FRED | St. Louis Fed</a>.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">30-Year Conventional Mortgage Rate (from Mortgage News Daily)</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>6.28%, up +.09% w/w (6.13-7.26).</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Treasury and corporate bond yields have remained in a relatively narrow range for three years, after the Fed engaged in sustained rate hikes. As a result, so long as rates remain in that range, they are neutral. The spreads between Treasuries and investment-grade and high-yield bonds continue to show little change as well, having meandered in a relatively narrow range for most of the past several years. If longer-dated Treasury yields decline, so will mortgage rates, and that in turn will turn housing data more positive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Housing </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mortgage applications (from the Mortgage Bankers Association)</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Purchase apps up +5% to 154 (114-163) [SA]</li> <li>Purchase apps 4 wk avg. down -1 to 153 [SA]</li> <li>Purchase apps YoY% up +20% [NSA]</li> <li>Purchase apps YoY 4 wk avg. +17.5% [NSA]</li> <li>Refi apps up +9% w/w [SA]</li> <li>Refi apps YoY up +111% [SA].</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">*[SA] = seasonally adjusted, [NSA] = not seasonally adjusted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Real Estate Loans (from the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/\" rel=\"nofollow\">FRB</a>).</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Up +0.1% w/w</li> <li>Up +1.5% YoY (vs. 1.3% low).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(Graph at <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=pAam\" rel=\"nofollow\">Real Estate Loans, All Commercial Banks | FRED | St. Louis Fed</a>.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both purchase mortgage and refinancing applications have been volatile, but within a limited range over the past 18 months. Both are now substantially higher YoY, but remain close to their longer term bottoms, so they generally score neutral.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2023, real estate loans sank below 1/2 of their 12 month high, the last housing indicator to turn negative, and have generally continued to worsen. A month ago they made yet another multi-year low, but have improved slightly since.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Money supply </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Federal Reserve has discontinued this weekly series. Data is now only released monthly. September data was released this week:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>M1 m/m up +0.4%, YoY Real M1 up +1.2% ( -1.4% 8/23 - +1.8% 7/25).</li> <li>M2 m/m up +0.5%, YoY Real M2 up +1.4% (2.1% June 2025 3 year high) (worst -8.6% 9/23).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">No recession has happened without a YoY real M1 negative, or YoY real M2 below +2.5%. Real M2 fell below that threshold in March 2022. Real M1 also turned negative as of May 2022. In the past, when the real money supply has rebounded to the levels it is at now, it has either been during the latter part of a recession, or in the period of recovery, so both of these are positive long leading metrics now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Corporate profits (Q3 64% actual + 36% estimated) from <a href=\"https://www.refinitiv.com/en/financial-data/company-data/institutional-brokers-estimate-system-ibes\" rel=\"nofollow\">I/B/E/S</a> via <a href=\"https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_080224.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">FactSet</a> at p. 33) </strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Q3 up +0.41 to 67.91, up +1.9% q/q.</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FactSet estimates earnings, which are replaced by actual earnings as they are reported, and are updated weekly. The \"neutral\" band is +/-3%. I also average the previous two quarters together, until at least 100 companies have actually reported. In Q1 earnings wound up lower by more than -3%, which turned the rating negative. In Q2 earnings rebounded sharply, causing the rating change to positive. Now that over 20% of companies have reported in Q3, the tepid increases so far warrant a change back to neutral.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Credit conditions (from the Chicago Fed) </strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Financial Conditions Index unchanged (loose) at -0.55 (-0.39 - -0.56).</li> <li>Adjusted Index (removing background economic conditions) up +.02 (less loose) to -0.54 (-0.38 - -0.56).</li> <li>Leverage subindex up +0.04 (less loose) to -0.11 (+0.13 - -0.53).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In these indexes, lower = better for the economy. The Chicago Fed's Adjusted Index's real break-even point is roughly -0.25. In the leverage index, a negative number is good, a positive one poor. The historical breakeven point has been -0.5 for the unadjusted index. After briefly deteriorating to neutral earlier this year, all three had been solidly positive, but the unadjusted index remains neutral. The leverage index is also on the verge of turning neutral.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Short leading indicators</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Economic Indicators from the late Jeff Miller’s “Weighing the Week Ahead” </strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4432910-an-in-depth-examination-of-the-miller-score\">Miller Score</a> (formerly \"C-Score\"): down -14 to 360, down -20 m/m (288 12/27/24 - 421 7/25/25). Components: Yield curve 43, Phillips curve 317.</li> <li>St. Louis Fed Financial Stress Index: down -0.1388 to -0.5081 (+0.5569 4/11/25 - -.9751 1/24/25).</li> <li>BCIp from Georg Vrba: up +9.4 to 94.7 as of 10/2/25. <a href=\"https://imarketsignals.com/ims-business-cycle-index/\" rel=\"nofollow\">iM's Business Cycle Index</a> (100 is max value, below 25 is recession signal averaging 20 weeks ahead).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Miller Score is designed to look 52 weeks ahead for whether or not a recession is possible. Any score over 500 means no recession. This number fell below that threshold at the beginning of August 2021, so not only is it negative, but we are now years into the “recession-eligible” time period. This indicator is heavily influenced by both the yield curve and the still very low unemployment rate vs. gas prices (expecting a reversal), which explains why it remains negative. My colleague who compiles this score began disaggregating the two components earlier this year. Gas prices and yield curve gyrations remain the most volatile inputs. Note that since one of the inputs is jobless claims, during the government shutdown that is estimated, so the reading is provisional.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The St. Louis Financial Stress Index is one where a negative score is a positive for the economy and, during its limited existence, has risen above zero before a recession by less than one year. It remained very positive until briefly in April. It then recovered, and until four weeks ago, remained among its better post-pandemic readings. As of this week, it is exactly at the lowest point it can be without turning neutral.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For 18 months, IM has stated that their system does not forecast a recession. Recently it did edge closer to their threshold, but has since rebounded.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Trade-weighted US$ </strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Up +0.22 to 121.34 w/w, down -2.8% YoY (last week) (broad) (119.67 - 130.21) (Graph at <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DTWEXBGS\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nominal Broad U.S. Dollar Index</a>.</li> <li>Up +0.87 to 99.80 w/w, down -4.3% YoY (<a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/dxy\" rel=\"nofollow\">major currencies</a>) (graph at link) (96.22- 110.18).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The neutral range for the US$ is between unchanged and 5% higher YoY. At 5% higher or more YoY, the strength suppresses exports and incentivizes imports, a negative for the economy. The trend in these measures had been from below 0 (thus positive) to neutral, to above 5% (negative) for 18 months, until the beginning of this year. Both measures are lower YoY now, as are positives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I mechanically score a slowly depreciating US$ as a positive because it makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive, thereby assisting domestic production. But this year it could be more a sign of relative US weakness.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Commodity prices </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bloomberg Commodity Index</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Down -0.08 to 107.30 (95.97 - 107.71)</li> <li>Up +9.4% YoY.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(Graph at <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/bcom?countrycode=xx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/bcom?countrycode=xx</a>.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bloomberg Industrial Metals ETF (from <a href=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/indices/tearsheet/summary?s=BCOMIN:IOM\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bloomberg</a>) (graph at link)</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>153.78, down -0.03 w/w (130.47 -160.83 )</li> <li>Up +3.8% YoY.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This spring the industrial measure gradually weakened from positive to negative. Then the broad commodity index declined sharply into negative territory, but then rebounded into neutral range and now positive. By contrast, the industrial metals measure remained very negative. This can be attributed to whether or not oil is included among the commodities tracked. Importantly, if commodities were not priced in US$ terms, but in other major currencies, it would have been quite a completely different story this year. Also note that BCOM includes precious metals (gold and silver), which until recently had been skyrocketing in US$ terms this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Stock prices</strong> S&amp;P 500 (from <strong><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=.SPX\" rel=\"nofollow\">CNBC</a>) </strong>(graph at link)</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Up +0.7% to 6840.20 (new all-time high intraweek).</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since July, stocks have made repeated new all-time highs. As a result, this indicator is positive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Regional Fed New Orders Indexes </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>(*indicates report this week) </strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/survey/empire/empiresurvey_overview.html%20\" rel=\"nofollow\">Empire State</a>, up +23.3 to +3.7</li> <li> <a href=\"https://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/2018/bos0618\" rel=\"nofollow\">Philly</a> up +5.8 to +18.2</li> <li> <a href=\"https://www.richmondfed.org/research/regional_economy/surveys_of_business_conditions/manufacturing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Richmond</a> up +9 to -6</li> <li>*<a href=\"https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/indicatorsdata/mfg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kansas City</a> down -2 to +1</li> <li>*<a href=\"https://www.dallasfed.org/research/surveys/tmos/2018/1806.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dallas</a> up +0.9 to -1.7</li> <li>Month-over-month rolling average: unchanged at +3.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The regional average is more volatile than the ISM manufacturing index, but usually correctly forecasts its month-over-month direction. Since midyear, these have improved to neutral and then to positive, and the overall tenor (surprisingly) continues to be an improvement to positive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since May I have added the regional service indexes. Those reports posted in the past week noted with an *:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Empire State down -4.2 to -19.4</li> <li>*<a href=\"https://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/regional-economy/business-outlook-survey/2018/bos0618\" rel=\"nofollow\">Philly</a> down -9.9 to -22.2</li> <li>*<a href=\"https://www.richmondfed.org/research/regional_economy/surveys_of_business_conditions/manufacturing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Richmond</a> up +6 to -1</li> <li> <a href=\"https://www.kansascityfed.org/research/indicatorsdata/mfg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kansas City</a> up +4 to -5</li> <li>*Dallas down -3.8 to -9.4</li> <li>Month-over-month rolling average: down -3 to -11.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most positive recent trend in all of the high frequency data in August was the sharp rebound in manufacturing all the way to solidly positive. Meanwhile, the regional non-manufacturing reports, which had stabilized at negative levels since May, then turned positive, have since turned sharply negative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Employment metrics </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Initial jobless claims (estimated from tabulation of NSA state claims)</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>230,000, up +6,000 w/w, up +0.5% YoY (last week)</li> <li>4-week average 226,500, down - 2,500 w/w, down -5.0% YoY (last week).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(Graph at <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=pAdx&amp;source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\" rel=\"nofollow\">St. Louis FRED</a>.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jobless claims were positive for most of 2024, except for hurricane-influenced weeks during the autumn. Then they turned moderately negative through midyear this year. But in July and August this indicator improved to positive before retreating in September.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This metric was reported during the last several government shutdowns, perhaps because it simply involved adding up all the states’ reports and then applying a seasonal factor. The non-seasonally adjusted state claims are still being reported. By tabulating them and then applying the same seasonal adjustment as was applied last year for the same week, we have the ability to arrive at the estimate above. For the first four weeks of the shutdown, there has been no appreciable change in the YoY comparisons.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Temporary staffing index</strong> (from the <a href=\"https://americanstaffing.net/staffing-research-data/asa-data-dashboard/asa-staffing-index/#tab:52-week-chart\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Staffing Association</a>) (graph at link)</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Unchanged at 91 w/w</li> <li>Up +1.4% YoY (low -13.6%- high +1.4% this week).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This series has been negative since early 2023. YoY comparisons continued to be negative throughout 2024. I suspect this was due to a secular change and giving a false signal as a result. The YoY reading was trending “less bad” for many months, then neutral, and finally, two weeks ago, it turned positive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Tax Withholding</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Last 20 workdays 2025 vs. 2024: $267.2 B vs. $257.4 B (+$22.9 B, or +3.8%).</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These were very positive for almost all of 2024, and with the exception of seven weeks (four after an April 15 anomaly), the trend has continued this year. The Treasury Department took all updated and past reports down this week. I am now using a different server to access these reports, so I ought to be able to report them, albeit with a one week delay, for the remainder of this shutdown. Note that although the number is positive, after adjusting for inflation, it is barely so this week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">California does frequently update its tax withholding data, most recently available here: <a href=\"https://lao.ca.gov/LAOEconTax/article/Detail/756\" rel=\"nofollow\">Income Tax Withholding Tracker</a>. It reported that withholding tax payments were up 11% YoY in September, cautioning that “withholding is also due on bonuses and stock options received by employees. Withholding on <a href=\"https://lao.ca.gov/LAOEconTax/Article/Detail/815\" rel=\"nofollow\">stock options</a> has made up a growing share of collections in recent years.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Oil prices and usage (from the E.I.A.) </strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Oil down -$0.61 to $60.87 w/w, down -10.0% YoY ($57.64 - $80.04).</li> <li>Gas prices are up +0.02 to $3.04 w/w, down -$0.06 YoY.</li> <li>Usage 4-week average down -4.2% YoY.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(Information can be found at “This Week In Petroleum” at the E.I.A.’s website.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Oil prices first declined into the bottom 1/3rd of their 3 year range, and so turned positive late in 2024, and then declined even further earlier this year. After the Israeli-Iran hostilities earlier this year, oil prices increased, but then receded back to new four year lows two weeks ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gas prices also recently made new 3 year lows, and so were also positive. They are now virtually unchanged YoY, and so their reading changes to neutral. Last year, mileage driven had been generally negative. It turned neutral and then positive earlier this year, but negative again last week. Since March of this year, it has oscillated between positive and negative. In general, both gas prices and usage have approached neutrality, although usage has deteriorated to negative in the past month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note: Given this measure’s extreme volatility, I believe the best measure is against their 3 year average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Bank lending rates </strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>4.04% Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), down -0.20 w/w.</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The TED Spread has been discontinued, and as of last September, so was LIBOR. At the suggestion of a reader, I began to track the SOFR instead. Unfortunately, SOFR has only been in existence since 2018, so there is no track record of how it might behave around normal recessions (vs. the pandemic). Over the past 5 years, it does appear to have matched the trend in LIBOR. Given the alternatives, I have included it in my list of indicators in the conclusion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Coincident indicators</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Tariff payments (one-week delay)</strong></h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>September 2025 vs. September 2024: $31.7 B vs. $8.8 B (+$22.9 B).</li> <li>October 1-24, 2025 vs. October 1-24, 2024: $31.7 B vs. $8.0 B (+$23.7 B).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have inaugurated this measure temporarily since other sources, such as inferences from the CPI and PPI, are imprecise and speculative so far. The above information comes directly from the Daily Treasury Statement. These fees are either absorbed by the importer or passed on to the consumer, or some proportion of each, and are removed from potential consumption on other items.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As per my above comments, the regional Fed reports indicate that these tariffs are having a substantial upward impact on prices paid for materials, with only about half of those increases - but nevertheless half - being passed on to consumers.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>St. Louis FRED Weekly Economic Index </strong></h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Down -0.16 to 2.00 w/w (low 1.65 November 2, 2024, high 3.21 November 23, 2024).</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This measure was in the neutral range during most of early 2024, but generally positive (above 2.00) since then, and came very close to setting a new 12 month high three months ago, before declining. After four weeks back in neutral range, including a new 6 month low, early this year it returned to positive territory and has remained there since, although this week it is at the exact lower boundary of that rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Restaurant reservations YoY (from Open Table) </strong><a href=\"https://www.opentable.com/state-of-industry\" rel=\"nofollow\">State of the Restaurant Industry</a></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Last week's 7-day average was up +10% YoY, vs. +8% one week prior.</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since 2023 this index has been very volatile, swinging between positive, neutral, and negative several times. In general, earlier this year the YoY trends improved, but with a great deal of noise. In summer this metric trended sharply higher, before backing off somewhat in the previous five weeks, and improved to multi-year highs during September before fading somewhat earlier this month.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Consumer spending </strong></h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Johnson Redbook up +5.2% YoY, 4 week average +5.5% (high 7.4% 4/25/25; 4.8% 2/1 and 7/3/2025) <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/redbook-index\" rel=\"nofollow\">United States Redbook Index</a>.</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Redbook index has been positive since February of last year. It had very good readings in April and early May, probably due to consumers front-running anticipated tariff price increases and shortages. Afterward it did weaken for a month, but in late August and September it increased sharply to very positive. I suspect that the “wealth effect” from the sharp increase in stock prices is crucial to this trend. In the past six weeks it has backed off, and by now the four week average is about in the middle of where it has been for the past year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Consumer inflation by Truflation</strong> (<a href=\"https://truflation.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Independent, economic &amp; financial data in real time on-chain | Truflation</a>).</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Down -0.30% to +2.00% YoY (High 3.11% 12/11/24 - Low 1.20% 4/8/25).</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a daily update to inflation, similar to the “billion prices project” of the last decade (which required a subscription). I have not added this to my list below of coincident or leading indicators, but needless to say, it is an up-to-the-moment reading on this very important indicator. This series has been volatile, and the YoY comparisons had been turning higher since September, but have been very low in the last several months, although it did make another new two month high four months ago.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Real Consumer Spending </strong></h3> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Up +3.2% YoY (high - 6.0% 4/25/25; 12 month low 1.7% 12/16/24).</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of my most important mantras is that consumption leads to employment. Real retail sales have a long history of doing so, but are only reported on a monthly basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The weekly result is derived simply by subtracting YoY inflation as measured by Truflation from the YoY change in nominal consumer spending as measured by Redbook. While it will be somewhat noisy, it should anticipate changes in the monthly measures ahead of time. made another 12 month high several months ago. After mainly weeks in the upper part of its 12 month range, it was tepid at the beginning of the year, before backing off. considerably along with nominal consumer spending in the past several months.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Transport </strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Railroads (from the</strong> <a href=\"https://www.aar.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AAR</a>)</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Carloads down -0.9% YoY (cumulative 2025 vs. 2024 up +1.9%)</li> <li>Intermodal units down 6.1% YoY (cumulative up +3.0%)</li> <li>Total loads down -3.8% YoY (cumulative up +2.5%).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(Graph at <a href=\"https://railfax.transmatch.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Railfax Report - North American Rail Freight Traffic Carloading Report</a>.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Shipping transport</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Harpex up +2 to 2184 (low 1966–high 2215)</li> <li>Baltic Dry Index down -74 to 1983 (low 715, high 2266).</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rail was mixed for many weeks before turning positive in March, presumably reflecting businesses attempting to get inventory before the new tariffs kick in. Intermodal rail loads had steadily decelerated since then, and five weeks ago turned negative. The total number of total loads was negative for several weeks as well. All three measures improved sharply in July, and remained positive, but weakened in August, and were negative again three weeks ago. Two weeks later it rebounded to positive again, then back to mixed, and this week negative. Nevertheless, the trend this year has been a gradual weakening.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Harpex was as high as nearly 4500 almost 2 years ago, but declined as low as 810 in December of last year before rising, setting repeated 12-month highs in the past four months. The usual interpretation for this is that demand is straining against supply, showing a strong global economy, and thus is very positive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similarly, the BDI was in a generally declining trend throughout 2022 before bottoming at a three year low of 530 in February 2023. The overall trend has been higher since then, rising to a high of 3346 last December, probably reflecting the Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. This year its low was 1309 in January, and its recent high was 2419 last March. It declined to the bottom 1/3rd of its one year range during the rest of the year, but rebounded all the way to the top of its six month range earlier this year, before retreating back into the middle of that range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am wary of reading too much into price indexes like this, since they are heavily influenced by supply (as in, a huge overbuilding of ships in the last decade) as well as demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Steel production</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.steel.org/industry-data\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Iron and Steel Institute</a><strong>) </strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Up +0.2% w/w.</li> <li>Up +9.9% YoY.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This metric has been very volatile for over a year. Recently it improved to neutral and then positive for two weeks before backing off to neutral again in May. Several months ago it returned to positive.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Summary And Conclusion </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below are this week’s spreadsheets of the long leading, short leading, and coincident readings.

The short end is still negative. Long-term bond rates by themselves continue in their neutral range. Corporate profit growth, which has also been a plus, has at least temporarily reverted to neutral as q/q earnings growth has been tepid - so far.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both short leading and coincident indicators remain very positive. As has been the case for many months, consumer spending remains a potent driver. In the absence of the best monthly data, I have paid close attention to the regional Fed manufacturing and service reports this month. They show an improving manufacturing outlook, but with prices both paid and received increasing sharply, the former more than the latter, and employment in the aggregate contracting. Next week, I suggest paying most attention to the monthly ISM manufacturing and services reports.</p>",

The stock was beaten down with significant tariff uncertainty, with fears over the impact on the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> firm’s earnings. Since then, the dip has only deepened.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the deepening of the dip, I still have a positive view of Canadian National’s shares. Recently released <a href=\"file:///C:/Users/ethan/Downloads/Q3-2025-Quarterly-Review-en%20%282%29.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q3 numbers</a>, while weaker than the 10-15% EPS growth initially guided for 2025, still show growing EPS nonetheless. This is despite the uncertain trading landscape Canadian National has faced.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fact is Canadian National still remains a major North American railroad, with a vast route network that cannot be replicated, limiting competition. Against trucking, the only other major way to move vast quantities of goods over land, the economics are <a href=\"https://www.floridarail.com/news/train-vs-truck-which-is-better-for-freight-shipping-infographic/\" rel=\"nofollow\">strongly in rail's favor</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this has led to above-market returns over the long run. Average returns on equity stand at 27%, and operating margins that average 40%, enable Canadian National to provide considerable returns to shareholders. The company boasts 29 years of continuous dividend growth since its IPO in 1995, rising at an average cumulative annual growth rate of 15%. Throw in the share buybacks, and it improves even further.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, Canadian National is going through a tough period, with tariffs impacting trade flows in ways the company has never experienced before. This has put pressure on the share price this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I remain positive, however. The latest Q3 results are nowhere near the disaster many thought tariffs would bring, and the valuation compared to recent years looks attractive. Let’s explore Canadian National further.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Canadian National recently reported its <a href=\"file:///C:/Users/ethan/Downloads/Q3-2025-Quarterly-Review-en%20%282%29.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">earnings for Q3 ’25</a>, giving a clear view of the current impact of tariffs. Revenues came in at C$4.17 billion, an increase of 1% from the previous year, and beat consensus estimates by C$20 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52578947-17619394592321315.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CNI Q3 2025 Earnings Report - revenues breakdown by freight segment\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>CNI Q3 2025 Earnings Report</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There were no large changes in any one segment with the exception of intermodal, which saw revenues rise 11%, driven by a 15% increase in carloads. This segment was a major cause of concern earlier this year with the risk of port disruptions and fears over trade flows, but this strong growth is the clearest sign yet that the tariff fears were vastly overblown.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue only tells one part of the story, however. Earnings are, for most investors, the more important number. Here, Canadian National delivered an earnings beat, with a 6% increase in operating income to C$1.61 billion and a 6% rise in adjusted EPS to C$1.83.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With revenue growth only at 1%, a 6% rise in earnings was driven by Canadian National’s margin expansion due to strong cost control. Total operating expenses fell 1% from the previous year, despite the wider inflationary environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A 20% fall in fuel expenses due to the removal of the Canadian federal carbon tax, lower fuel prices, and a 2% gain in fuel efficiency led to a C$101 million saving. In addition, labor costs were kept in check, falling 2%, driven by workforce reductions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This combination of intermodal holding up despite the tariff risks supporting a small growth in revenue, and falling operating expenses led to a 1.7% improvement in the operating ratio from the previous year, which fell to 61.4%. While the fall in fuel costs may largely be due to factors outside management's control, the increase in labor productivity, which led to a reduction in labor costs, shows management is actively focused on making the firm more profitable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the quarter, Canadian National posted cash flows from operations of C$1.9 billion, up from C$1.8 billion a year earlier, which, after accounting for C$1.12 billion in investing activities, gave a free cash flow of C$793 million, a C$209 million increase from a year earlier. Also announced in earnings was that 2026 capital expenditures are now expected to be C$550 million lower, which should result in improved cash flow in the coming year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the year heading to a close, management affirmed that the firm remains on track to meet its guidance for mid- to high single digit earnings per share growth. This is set to be driven by continued strong performance across the intermodal and bulk volumes to finish the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52578947-17619394688249724_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1262\" data-height=\"672\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52578947-17619394688249724_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Outlook for remainder of the year by freight segment for Canadian National Railways\" width=\"640\" height=\"341\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52578947-17619394688249724_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52578947-17619394688249724_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52578947-17619394688249724_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52578947-17619394688249724_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52578947-17619394688249724_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52578947-17619394688249724_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52578947-17619394688249724_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52578947-17619394688249724_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Canadian National Q3 '25 Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, Canadian National posted a modestly positive set of results, which showed improved efficiency causing a decrease in the operating ratio, which was countered by revenue growth of only 1%, which stopped these from being strong results. With three-quarters of the year now reported, Canadian National is on track to reach its full-year EPS growth forecast, though continued volume growth will be key for this to continue into 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Railroads are a cyclical industry, exposed to the wider economic environment, and the trade flows of a country. As such, I believe it is best to take a longer-term view when considering an investment in Canadian National. Over the past couple of years, existing shareholders may have underperformed the S&amp;P500 index, but when this is expanded to a multi-decade view, it shows above market returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_2db4cdc8e2bee6bd06f61c53b00ef735.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_2db4cdc8e2bee6bd06f61c53b00ef735.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_2db4cdc8e2bee6bd06f61c53b00ef735.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_2db4cdc8e2bee6bd06f61c53b00ef735.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_2db4cdc8e2bee6bd06f61c53b00ef735.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_2db4cdc8e2bee6bd06f61c53b00ef735.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_2db4cdc8e2bee6bd06f61c53b00ef735.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_2db4cdc8e2bee6bd06f61c53b00ef735.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_2db4cdc8e2bee6bd06f61c53b00ef735.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_2fc760e08bdfedc207739c6eb44386b3.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_2fc760e08bdfedc207739c6eb44386b3.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_2fc760e08bdfedc207739c6eb44386b3.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_2fc760e08bdfedc207739c6eb44386b3.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_2fc760e08bdfedc207739c6eb44386b3.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_2fc760e08bdfedc207739c6eb44386b3.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_2fc760e08bdfedc207739c6eb44386b3.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_2fc760e08bdfedc207739c6eb44386b3.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_2fc760e08bdfedc207739c6eb44386b3.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When we compare Canadian National to its North American railroad peers: Canadian Pacific Kansas City (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CP\" title=\"Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited\">CP</a>), CSX (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSX\" title=\"CSX Corporation\">CSX</a>), Union Pacific (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNP\" title=\"Union Pacific Corporation\">UNP</a>), Norfolk Southern (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NSC\" title=\"Norfolk Southern Corporation\">NSC</a>), we see that for many of them, they're trading at their lowest price-to-earnings multiple in five years. And this isn’t an artificially low multiple because we are at the peak of a cycle; this is one of the toughest years in a while for railroads, given the impact of trade uncertainty. Of course, things could still get tougher next year, but this isn’t a buying-at-the-peak scenario, and I am firmly of the view that in the long run, freight volumes will continue to grow, supporting railroads with their <a href=\"https://www.floridarail.com/news/train-vs-truck-which-is-better-for-freight-shipping-infographic/\" rel=\"nofollow\">strong economics. </a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, Canadian National trades at the lowest valuation amongst its peer group, and while its exposure to cross-border trade may be higher, the discount seems excessive, especially when Canadian Pacific Kansas City Southern faces a similar impact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This comes despite Canadian National having some of the best characteristics of the railroads:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>3 coast reach, enabling an unmatched network across the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts, reducing reliance on any single trade corridor.</li> <li>Superior fuel economy, with one of the lowest fuel consumptions per gross ton mile supporting lower costs.</li> <li>Access to Prince Rupert, North America’s closest port to Asia, providing faster transit times and long-term capacity growth prospects, while allowing the avoidance of congestion at other West Coast ports.</li> <li>Operational flexibility around the congested Chicago gateway, giving Canadian National the ability to interchange and move traffic effectively.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the long run, Canadian National continues to look strongly positioned with the ability to continue generating stable free cash flow, even during weakness in the freight market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To complement this relative valuation, let’s put a price target on Canadian National. In 2025, revenue is on track to be $12.35 billion, and assuming 4% growth in 2026 due to volume and pricing growth, we get revenue of $12.84 billion. To determine EBIT, I calculated Canadian National’s EBIT margin over the past 5 years and estimate it to remain stable at 42.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To determine an exit EV/EBIT multiple, I took the midpoint of the company’s 5-year average of 18.22 and the industry average of 17.49 to get an exit multiple of 17.85. I then reduce this by 1 to account for the fact that Canadian National may be hit harder than other railroads by the impact of tariffs, given its large cross border business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This method balances the company’s historical valuation multiple with that of similar companies and considers CNI’s valuation to peers, trends in the industry, and CNI’s historical performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we assume that cash and debt levels remain constant with any cash flow reinvested, paid out in dividends, or used for share buybacks, running the calculations implies a market cap of $76.7 billion for the end of 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we assume that Canadian National buys back 3% of its shares outstanding over the course of the next year, we reach 599 million shares outstanding at the end of 2026. This translates to a share price target of USD$128.05, suggesting Canadian National remains attractively valued.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of major risks, while the biggest risk of tariffs appears to have faded, this could always change. Canada only currently faces an effective tariff of 3% on exports to the U.S., given all the carve-outs and exemptions, but this could always change, impacting cross-border freight volumes. There is also the risk that weaker, wider economic conditions hit volumes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, CNI is exposed to potential operational disruptions. As we have seen in previous quarters, natural events such as the freezing weather disrupted shipments, and in the past <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadian-national-railway-suspends-service-some-networks-due-wildfires-2024-05-13/\" rel=\"nofollow\">wildfires</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-flooding-in-nova-scotia-washes-out-cn-rail-track-disrupting-train/\" rel=\"nofollow\">flooding</a> have reduced freight volumes and earnings. Labor disputes both at CNI and external companies like port operators remain another key risk CNI faces, leading to operational disruption. Although strike action is incredibly disruptive, union activity can also result in significant pay increases, leading to higher labor costs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Canadian National’s Q3 results presented a solid beat. Revenues experienced a small rise with strong cost control leading to expenses falling, resulting in EPS growth of 6%. This came despite one of the most challenging operating environments in recent years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While tariff uncertainty and weaker freight demand continue to weigh on the share price, I don’t believe these will be a long-term drag on the company. Canadian National remains one of the strongest railroads with an unmatched three-coast network and access to Prince Rupert that position it for long-term growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At current levels, the valuation looks undemanding, trading below peers and at the lowest multiple in five years. With a nearly three decade record of dividends and share buybacks, my 2026 price target of $128 implies strong upside from current prices.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With strong long-term fundamentals, I continue to believe Canadian National is a high-quality position to hold in a portfolio for the long term. I continue to assign a buy rating.</p>",

That’s due to a number of reasons, including the fact that I'm somewhat unorthodox when it comes to investing. Unlike many, I do not put<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> cash to work on a regular basis. While I often reinvest dividends, I often build larger cash positions to invest in my highest-conviction ideas instead of buying for a fixed amount every month.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another reason is that I own just 16 individual stocks with a very low turnover rate, as I rarely make major changes to my portfolio. I also do not collect a lot of data. Unlike many who have a fancy chart for every portfolio statistic, I just keep it simple and put as much money as possible (within reason) into my highest-conviction ideas with a very long time horizon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market will do the rest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, I have written quite a few articles recently, including an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829599-my-entire-financial-future-relies-on-these-16-stocks\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829599-my-entire-financial-future-relies-on-these-16-stocks\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> titled <em>\"My Entire Financial Future Relies On These 16 Stocks\"</em> on Oct.14. Then, on Oct. 28, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833916-my-portfolios-biggest-problem-4-stocks-betting-on-next\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833916-my-portfolios-biggest-problem-4-stocks-betting-on-next\" target=\"_blank\">I wrote</a> <em>\"My Portfolio’s Biggest Problem - And The 4 Stocks I’m Betting On Next.\"</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have to say that the Oct. 28 article was somewhat unexpected as it was about how concentrated my portfolio had become. I explained how the &gt;180% surge in the Comfort Systems USA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FIX\" title=\"Comfort Systems USA, Inc.\">FIX</a>) stock price had boosted that position to more than 17.0% of my portfolio. This resulted in the top three investments accounting for 43% of my entire liquid net worth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, I spent a lot of time discussing why I hate selling, in general, how professionals assess this topic, what kind of questions I think we all should be asking before selling, and what I expect to do with the proceeds. Please feel free to read it if you haven’t already. I was really happy with the replies and super glad I could add value to people’s own investment process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going back to FIX, the main reason I decided to actually sell is because of its valuation. I was up more than 180% on an investment bought in March. It now trades at more than 40x earnings in a market where everyone and their pet knows that AI is a hot trend. While I still love FIX and believe it will trade much higher ten years from now, I started to dislike the risk/reward, especially in light of other terrific opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, I pulled the trigger. I sold FIX, freeing up more than 17% cash. And, as I promised, I deployed this capital, as I have never been a net seller since I started long-term investing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this article, I’ll give you a quick overview of my new portfolio structure, discuss three of my smaller investments, and then spend way more time on the one big addition to my portfolio that I have been eyeing for a while.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I am super excited to share this with you, let’s get right to it.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">My 3 Additions and My Four Big Portfolio Themes</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m going to keep this part rather short for two reasons:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The companies I added to are often featured in my articles.</li> <li>My new portfolio addition will require a lot of attention, which means I need to keep my word count in this part subdued.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The funny thing is that the transactions I made barely impacted my total portfolio worth. After all, I simply rotated some cash. If we ignore a few grand in dividends that I also reinvested, my total portfolio value remained unchanged.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, it doesn’t feel like that, as I exchanged a huge position in a company for what I consider a rich valuation for four investments with terrific valuations. To me, it feels like I now have a much stronger portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I already hinted in my prior article, I doubled my positions in Old Dominion Freight Line (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ODFL\" title=\"Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc.\">ODFL</a>) and Carlisle Companies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSL\" title=\"Carlisle Companies Incorporated\">CSL</a>), two companies that embody two of my biggest theses, which are transportation (cyclical value) and housing/construction remodeling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because both companies performed rather poorly (to put it mildly) this year, I'm very happy I used this opportunity to substantially boost my stake in these companies, making them my fourth and sixth-largest investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I also boosted my investment in LandBridge (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LB\" title=\"LandBridge Company LLC\">LB</a>) yet again. I know it somewhat defeats my argument that I want to avoid being too top-heavy, as LB now accounts for 16.4% of my portfolio, but I simply love this investment and the combo of energy, water, and commercial infrastructure in the Permian Basin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After making these changes and buying the new investment I’m about to show you in just a second, I now have a portfolio that is dominated by four major industries:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>My two landowners, Texas Pacific Land (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TPL\" title=\"Texas Pacific Land Corporation\">TPL</a>) and LandBridge, account for 27% of my portfolio. Officially, landowners aren’t an industry, but I decided to go with a customer classification here. This perfectly embodies my bullishness on energy, Permian water, and surface operations like AI-related infrastructure.</li> <li>Roughly a fifth of my portfolio consists of defense companies. Here, I didn’t change anything. These are mostly anti-cyclical defense and commercial giants like RTX Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTX\" title=\"RTX Corporation\">RTX</a>), GE Aerospace (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GE\" title=\"General Electric Company\">GE</a>), Northrop Grumman (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NOC\" title=\"Northrop Grumman Corporation\">NOC</a>), and L3Harris Technologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LHX\" title=\"L3Harris Technologies, Inc.\">LHX</a>).</li> <li>Freight &amp; logistics cover my two Class I railroads, Union Pacific (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNP\" title=\"Union Pacific Corporation\">UNP</a>) and Canadian Pacific Kansas City (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CP\" title=\"Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited\">CP</a>). Both investments have done poorly for more than four years and are critical to my cyclical value thesis. It also includes my just-boosted investment in ODFL.</li> <li>The biggest change is the fact that I now have 15% exposure to the homebuilding industry. This is because of my larger investment in CSL and because of my latest investment. Homebuilding is one of my biggest theses as I believe the market is massively undersupplied and benefiting from decades of underinvestment in maintenance.

(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QXO\" title=\"QXO, Inc.\">QXO</a>)</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QXO is a company I have increasingly brought up in recent articles. Especially the ones where I focused on just how bullish I am on housing on a longer-term basis (i.e., the article I just mentioned).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interestingly, QXO does not pay a dividend, which makes it somewhat of a unique case in my portfolio. I also do not expect it to pay a dividend for many years, as this is an M&amp;A-focused business with a very clear vision that I will get to in a bit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Besides that QXO perfectly fits my thesis as I will explain in this article, I also feel rather close with the company, as I have been in frequent contact with someone from their executive team and even had various exchanges with their Chairman, Founder, and Chief Executive Officer Brad Jacobs, the billionaire investor who has one of the best track records of value generation in all of America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, and this is very important for you to know:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>I have never received any information that wasn’t public.</li> <li>I have never been asked to cover QXO or say anything positive about the company.</li> <li>Besides a free PDF copy of Brad Jacob’s book, I have never received anything of value, whether it’s a tangible good or money. Nothing. Nada.</li> <li>None of this will change. </li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now that I have gotten that out of the way, I can tell you what QXO is all about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">See, even before QXO was founded, Brad Jacobs and I (independently from each other, of course) had the same view, which is that there’s tremendous money in America’s housing and commercial construction market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I turned this into a tangible idea by buying Carlisle Companies and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4741308-a-new-golden-age-2-dividend-stocks-set-to-cash-in-on-a-monumental-trend\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4741308-a-new-golden-age-2-dividend-stocks-set-to-cash-in-on-a-monumental-trend\" target=\"_blank\">explaining to investors</a> that the average commercial building is more than 50-years-old, while the residential market has been substantially undersupplied. Brad Jacobs turned his vision into reality by <a href=\"https://investors.qxo.com/news/news-details/2024/QXO-Completes-1-Billion-Equity-Investment/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.qxo.com/news/news-details/2024/QXO-Completes-1-Billion-Equity-Investment/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">investing a billion </a>dollars' worth of equity into a company called SilverSun Technologies in June of last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The short version of this complex transaction is that Mr. Jacobs got a public company without having to build something from the ground up and IPO it. After investing in SilverSun, they changed the name to QXO and had a legal vehicle they could use for M&amp;A.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That also explains why the QXO stock price looks like this:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300856207016_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"900\" data-height=\"469\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300856207016_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"334\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300856207016_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300856207016_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300856207016_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300856207016_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300856207016_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300856207016_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300856207016_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300856207016_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>StockCharts</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, the name QXO is similar to other companies that Brad Jacobs has founded, as the multi-billionaire investor has also founded, among others, United Rentals (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/URI\" title=\"United Rentals, Inc.\">URI</a>) and XPO (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XPO\" title=\"XPO, Inc.\">XPO</a>), which spun off GXO (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GXO\" title=\"GXO Logistics, Inc.\">GXO</a>) and RXO (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RXO\" title=\"RXO, Inc.\">RXO</a>).

United Rentals benefited from the demand for asset-light machinery operations. XPO serviced a rapidly growing less-than-truckload market.</li> <li>Use free cash flow and external funding to acquire businesses in highly fragmented markets. Both trucking and the rental business were and still are fragmented.</li> <li>Incorporate new businesses and improve them through technology.</li> <li>Use accelerating cash flows to keep the balance sheet healthy and build even more room for M&amp;A.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Essentially, Mr. Jacobs has been playing Monopoly in hot markets for many decades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The major difference now is that he did not IPO his own business but bought SilverSun. He then went on to buy Beacon Roofing Supply, a company that initially resisted a takeover. The deal was completed in April of this year for roughly $11 billion and turned QXO into a leader of the roofing supply market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can imagine, Jacobs and his team moved quickly and did not waste any time building a strong foundation for growth in what they consider to be an $800 billion market opportunity:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>“Acquiring Beacon is a major step forward in our strategy to make QXO the leading tech-enabled company in the $800 billion building products distribution industry,” said Brad Jacobs, chairman and chief executive officer of QXO. “We’re excited to welcome Beacon’s talented team and, together, apply our proven playbook to accelerate growth, expand margins, and create an unmatched customer experience.” - <a href=\"https://investors.qxo.com/news/news-details/2025/QXO-Completes-Acquisition-of-Beacon-Roofing-Supply/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.qxo.com/news/news-details/2025/QXO-Completes-Acquisition-of-Beacon-Roofing-Supply/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">QXO News Release</a></em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QXO, which has President Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as an independent director on its board, made a smart move by starting in the roofing business. In addition to giving the company actual cash flows and a tangible business, it’s also 80% driven by non-discretionary repair and remodeling operations. That’s what I love so much about this distribution business, as the company benefits from both new construction and remodeling needs without having to produce its own products. As a result, Beacon generated positive organic revenue growth in 17 out of 21 years since going public in 2004.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859431207_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1558\" data-height=\"866\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859431207_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"356\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859431207_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859431207_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859431207_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859431207_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859431207_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859431207_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859431207_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859431207_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>QXO</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The deal also gave the company roughly 600 branches with 110,000 customers and 135,000 unique products.

While we can work with organic growth, it’s a company that will use any opportunity it has to buy new players and rapidly expand its footprint. Especially during times of weakness among cyclical housing stocks, I can imagine the M&amp;A team at QXO is working overtime.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For starters, Wall Street is bullish. Using the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QXO/ratings/sell-side-ratings\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QXO/ratings/sell-side-ratings\" target=\"_blank\">Seeking Alpha overview</a> below, we see the company has 12 Strong Buy ratings. That’s out of 15. The average price target is nearly 80% above its current price. Needless to say, that’s a lot of optimism, one could say.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-1761730085988609_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1652\" data-height=\"1580\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-1761730085988609_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"612\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-1761730085988609_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-1761730085988609_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-1761730085988609_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-1761730085988609_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-1761730085988609_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-1761730085988609_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-1761730085988609_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-1761730085988609_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the most bullish companies on the street is Wolfe Research, which has a price target of $44 on the company, roughly 140% above the current price. I looked into its findings (paywalled research) and believe they have done a great job assessing the risk/reward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, the company agrees with QXO, as it sees doubling organic EBITDA and total EBITDA of more than $4.5 billion by 2030. It believes the company can achieve this without raising more equity, using free cash flow, and higher margins, while also doubling the EBITDA of newly bought businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Essentially, QXO is expected to grow organic EBITDA by 15% per year. This is possible based on volumes and higher margins. After all, as I already mentioned, the distribution business is the perfect breeding ground for higher margins, especially when effectively using AI tools.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, it uses a 17x multiple for its 2030 EBITDA estimates and discounts it using its cost of capital. Despite having such a bullish rating, Wolfe does not believe it’s too aggressive as 17x EBITDA would be in line with the S&amp;P 500 industrials sector. In fact, given that QXO has the capacity to far outpace the growth of its peers, it could deserve a higher multiple. At 17x earnings, it would be competing with other efficient distribution businesses, including Watsco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WSO\" title=\"Watsco, Inc.\">WSO</a>) and Pool Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/POOL\" title=\"Pool Corporation\">POOL</a>), which are both companies I admire for their operations.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859956324_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1316\" data-height=\"756\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859956324_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"368\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859956324_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859956324_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859956324_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859956324_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859956324_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859956324_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859956324_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859956324_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Wolfe Research, FactSet</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, the company expects QXO to maintain a 3x leverage ratio, which should provide it with the stability needed to take on debt at attractive rates if it has to. S&amp;P Global <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3356173\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3356173\" target=\"_blank\">has given</a> the company a BB- rating. Although this is not an investment-grade rating, it's very normal for a conservative rating at this stage of its growth expansion. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is what S&amp;P Global wrote with regard to QXO's future, which shows how promising its growth and debt reduction plans are:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>The stable outlook on QXO Inc. indicates our expectation of S&amp;P Global Ratings-adjusted leverage of just over 5x and operating cash flow (OCF) to debt in the low end of the 15%-25% range in 2025 with leverage improving comfortably within the 4x-5x range within 12 months. We expect the company will maintain margin performance which, in turn, will generate sufficient cash to reduce its debt balance. - S&amp;P Global</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, despite its somewhat low rating, I see no reason to worry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Morgan Stanley seems to agree with Wolfe, as I looked into their findings as well. The company called the company \"A $50 Billion Pound Gorilla\" and gave it an overweight rating with a $35 price target. Here’s what the research company, which I highly respect, wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>Too cheap for the CAGR: High quality US Distributors trade at premium multiples (~18x EBITDA) and QXO will compound EBITDA + cash flow at a significantly faster rate than the group, a supportive backdrop for QXO’s long-term re-rating prospects. QXO is expected to compound EBITDA at a ~40% CAGR through decade - roughly 5x the peer group, yet shares trade at a discount. Even if we exclude incremental M&amp;A, we see QXO generating a ~20% EBITDA CAGR through 2030 on BECN turnaround which alone supports a $26 p/sh equity value on our math. - Morgan Stanley (paywalled research)</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, I think the only thing that decides whether Wolfe or Morgan Stanley is right is the pace of economic growth. If my housing thesis is right, we could see a substantial increase in building activity. This could create unexpected tailwinds for QXO.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Needless to say, as QXO perfectly fits my requirements, I made it my third-largest investment, which means it’s the biggest starter position ever of mine.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>I feel great about the management team.</li> <li>It perfectly aligns with my long-term housing view.</li> <li>Its business model makes a lot of sense in a fragmented industry.</li> <li>It could be one of the best examples of an efficient AI utilizer over time.</li> <li>I think it’s way too cheap despite increasing coverage from Wall Street.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will discuss the risks in the risk part of this article (below the takeaway).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All things considered, I will give QXO a lot more attention. This doesn’t mean I will bombard you with it on a daily basis, but use it more often in quarterly reports and to cover my housing thesis over time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My portfolio overhaul has been finished.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After selling my Comfort Systems position due to risk/reward reasons, I now believe I have optimized the odds of beating the market for my portfolio. I doubled my investments in Old Dominion Freight Line, Carlisle, expanded LandBridge, and added a new ultra-high conviction idea, QXO.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s now my third-largest investment and my biggest started position ever.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I feel great about it, as I now have further solidified my four biggest investment theses, accounting for roughly three-fourths of my portfolio:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Landowners/energy</li> <li>Defense</li> <li>Wide-moat transportation</li> <li>Housing suppliers</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, and I cannot stress this enough, my portfolio is not an event-driven investment vehicle, as all of my holdings are long-term compounders with the ability to generate value even during tough economic times. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I may regret selling FIX, I am quite upbeat about the future, the way things are now, as I believe even a small uptick in cyclical growth could propel my portfolio to new highs. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a side note, here is a full overview of my holdings and their weighting:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859069297_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1656\" data-height=\"620\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859069297_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"640\" height=\"240\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859069297_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859069297_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859069297_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859069297_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859069297_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859069297_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859069297_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/31557165-17617300859069297_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Leo Nelissen</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The average dividend yield is now 1.5%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks and A Few More Notes</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I know I increased risks tied to cyclical growth. While FIX is a cyclical company as well, ODFL, CSL, LB, and QXO are all cyclical companies to some extent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While LB has substantial non-oil revenue and QXO benefits from remodeling demand, a steep recession would likely create substantial stock price declines, even if it’s just temporary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm fully aware of these risks. I know I'm running an unorthodox dividend growth portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, I'm looking to diversify. When I add new capital to my portfolio, I will likely diversify into non-industrial/energy sectors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For QXO specifically, risks involve finding suitable M&amp;A targets. While it has a promising organic growth outlook, it competes with large companies like Home Depot for new deals. One great example is how Home Depot also <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-wins-bidding-war-120828795.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-depot-wins-bidding-war-120828795.html\" target=\"_blank\">went after GMS</a> and won the deal.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other risks are tied to the integration of new companies and general technology improvements. Or, to put it differently, the company’s ambitious plans could unfold much more slowly than expected.</p>",

However, I am now downgrading CLVT to hold. The business is not recovering as well as I expect it to. The segments that needed to recover (IP and LSH) continue to be weak. At ~4.8x forward PE, the stock still looks inexpensive, but in my view, it deserves the discount until management can prove that organic growth is sustainable.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings Results Review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20283699-clarivate-reports-third-quarter-2025-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A2\">CLVT Q3 2025</a> results were disappointing. The headline revenue looks good, but the underlying business is actually not doing as well. It reported total revenue of $623.1 million, which is basically flat y/y but was ahead of consensus. The reason for this beat needs attention, because it wasn’t driven by the core business. The beat came largely from several large, one-time, low-margin e-book transactions within the Academia &amp; Government [ANG] segment, which CLVT is in the process of winding down (the e-book subsegment). In other words, this one-off tailwind is unlikely to happen again. Also, the reason for the FY2025 revenue guide to be raised was because this exit is taking longer than expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On an organic basis, revenue fell 0.1% y/y, a sequential deceleration vs. the 0.5% growth in Q2 2025. Subscription revenue grew 1.2% y/y, but this was fully offset by a 3.2% decline in recurring IP renewals and a 2.8% decline in transactional revenue. By segment, ANG was the only segment that grew, with 2% y/y organic growth, but the IP business fell 2.7% y/y, and Life Sciences &amp; Healthcare [LSH] fell 0.7% y/y. As you can imagine, this impacted margins. Adj. EBITDA fell to $252.4 million from $264.4 million, with margins down 200 bps to 40.5%. Hence, at the bottom line, adj. EPS came in only at $0.18.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bull Case</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the flat organic headline performance was disappointing, there are some positive signals that supported my previous bull case. This is also why I see Q3 as a mixed bag rather than an outright miss. The most important leading indicator, in my view, remains organic annual contract value [ACV], which accelerated again to 1.6% growth. This was 1.3% in Q2, which I noted as the first real sign of a turnaround. With another quarter of improvement, ACV is now up 70 bps since FY2024, and this suggests that the current 1.2% growth in Q3’s subscription revenue can continue to accelerate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The quality of this ACV improvement is also another very bullish development. I believe the real reason for this improvement is really the pivot to a subscription-first model. We can see this in the numbers. Recurring organic revenue is now 88% of total organic revenue on a year-to-date basis, up 800 bps from 80% for FY2024. The underlying customer health is also getting better as renewal rates are now at 93%, up 100 bps y/y, which confirms that the subscription model is resonating. This is perhaps one of the clearest signs that the business model is stabilizing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even the IP segment, which has been a major drag, has started to stabilize. Yes, the Q3 organic decline was ugly, but on a year-to-date basis, recurring patent revenue is now flat versus the 3% decline in 2024. That is the type of improvement I want to see, as it suggests a bottom may be forming. Elsewhere on the AI front, I am expecting the adoption trend to continue going upwards to the right because of the new products launched. Over the past 12 months, CLVT rolled out 12 new AI-powered capabilities, and these are commercial-grade products that are valuable. Take the Derwent Patent Monitor, for example. It uses AI to assign threat ratings in IP portfolios. Essentially, it acts as a smart early-warning system that flags competitor filings that could be a risk to the organization. In the past, this was done through manually looking through thousands of new patents, which is extremely time-consuming and costly. But all this can now be done automatically, which not only cuts down labor costs but also de-risks an organization's business (that relies on their IP). Another good example is the Cortellis Regulatory Assistant, which uses conversational AI to make life easier when navigating a regulatory landscape. This is specifically useful for biopharma and medtech companies, where the regulatory landscape is complex and profound. Instead of looking through each legal note, this AI tool allows an organization to ask questions (like how you ask ChatGPT something) and receive answers in seconds. Again, over here, there will be a lot of time and cost saved.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bear Case</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now for the bear case, which is a strong one that frankly has pushed me back from bullish to neutral in the near term. The most disappointing development was that the turnaround narrative is somewhat broken. My earlier view on this recovery was based on the steady organic growth acceleration (0.3% in Q1 2025, followed by 0.5% in Q2, which I expected to continue). But this quarter, that trend turned for the worse. Total organic revenue fell -0.1% y/y, and as much as there are positive signals, this was a really huge setback that kills that recovery narrative (at least for the near-term).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bigger problem is that this organic decline was in the two segments that needed to turn around the most. Intellectual property remains the biggest drag, with organic revenue down 2.7% y/y, including a 3.2% decline in recurring patent renewals. This is very bad because it is exactly the part of the business that needs to stabilize first, yet it’s still shrinking. Think about it, the recurring patent renewals are the “base” of the business that gives recurring revenue, which CLVT can use to reinvest for growth. If that continues to shrink, the business will just be too tough to be in growth mode. The LSH segment also saw a 0.7% organic decline. While ANG is growing, it doesn’t matter because the other two segments represent the majority of adj. EBITDA, so until they recover, the earnings outlook is just not great.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618769147823124.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"569\" height=\"768\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618769147823124.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618769147823124.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618769147823124.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618769147823124.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618769147823124.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618769147823124.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618769147823124.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618769147823124.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All of this circles back to valuation and, more importantly, trust. I’d been vocal that the stock looked cheap, but I think it is also fair that the market remains skeptical, and Q3 proved the market right. The headline beat was not structural, and the underlying organic growth trend has turned for the worse. This certainly does not help when CLVT has a record of missing consensus estimates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, despite the stock becoming cheaper than when I wrote about it last time (now at 4.8x forward PE), I am revising my rating to hold. Until management can deliver clean, consistent core organic growth, it doesn’t matter if the ACV growth trend is positive. I don’t think that alone will move the stock. In my view, the shares will stay in this penalty box for now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I downgrade to a hold rating for CLVT. The bull case that I thought would happen failed to materialize, with the organic growth trend turning negative. While there are bright spots like a growing subscription mix, early traction from AI products, and solid retention, there is just no strong momentum in the broader turnaround. Until CLVT delivers durable organic growth, I expect the stock to remain range-bound.</p>",

This is likely reflecting investor optimism following the company’s performance in the last few quarters.</p> <p>The Q3 2025 results continued to demonstrate MPS’s structural<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> growth strength, with revenue up 18.9% year-on-year and stable margins.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would argue that these results are not merely cyclical or temporary. Rather, they stem from the structural strengths that underpin Monolithic Power Systems Inc.’s (MPS) long-term growth story.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this article, I examine the company’s performance over the past decade to uncover the underlying drivers behind its exceptional compounding record — focusing on the strategic, operational, and structural factors that continue to sustain its growth and profitability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MPS is a high-quality analog semiconductor firm with structural, organic growth driven by proprietary power-management IP, deep customer integration, and an efficient fabless model. Its exposure to data center, automotive, and industrial markets supports continued double-digit earnings growth. While financially sound with peer-leading performance, much of its strength is already priced in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Organic-driven growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MPS is a fabless analog semiconductor company generating almost all its revenue from sales of proprietary power-management ICs and modules. Its value proposition combines advanced analog design, high integration, and energy efficiency, underpinned by a strong balance sheet and asset-light manufacturing model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the past decade, the company managed to grow revenue at a 23% CAGR. Management explicitly credited its engineering-driven growth model - rather than M&amp;A or one-off demand surges - as the source of its long-term outperformance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This growth was almost entirely organic, fueled by consistent innovation, deeper customer integration, and expansion into larger, higher-value markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MPS serves the global power management IC market, a moderately growing one as exemplified by the following:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">“The global power management IC market size was estimated at USD 40,293.8 million in 2024…growing at a CAGR of 6.8% from 2025 to 2030.” <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/power-management-integrated-circuit-ic-market-report\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/power-management-integrated-circuit-ic-market-report\" target=\"_blank\">Grand View Research</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">“The global power management IC market size was valued at USD 39.39 billion in 2024…exhibiting a CAGR of 6.5% during the forecast period (2024 to 2032).<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"759366235\">\"</em> <a href=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/power-management-ic-market-110034?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/power-management-ic-market-110034?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune Business Insights</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the time horizons differ, it nonetheless illustrates that MPS’s historical revenue growth has significantly outpaced the broader market. This implied that its expansion was driven primarily by market-share gains rather than overall sector growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I will show later in the peer analysis section, MPS achieved the best revenue growth rate among the peers, supporting this market share gain picture.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moats</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that a big part of its growth was due to the following competitive advantages:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">i) Intangibles. MPS has proprietary analog and mixed-signal power-management architectures, patented process technologies, and advanced packaging IP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ii) Customer embeddedness - Deep engineering integration and long-term partnerships. Many programs are custom-tuned or co-developed. This integration raises the cost for customers to disengage and strengthens MPS’s insight into upcoming product roadmaps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">iii) Capital efficiency advantage - Fabless model. This setup allows MPS to maintain lower fixed-cost burdens, respond flexibly to demand, and reinvest more into R&amp;D. These support long-term margin resilience and innovation cycles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The above analysis suggests that the MPS growth trajectory is structural rather than cyclical, and it is likely to sustain its historical double-digit pace for some time. With China accounting for roughly half its revenue in recent years, MPS has leveraged its global presence to penetrate large, fast-evolving end markets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Higher profit growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MPS was able to leverage its high revenue growth into a much stronger profit growth. Over the past decade, operating profit and PAT grew at 34% and 55% respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart 1 provides some insights into the profit drivers. You can see that the gross profit margin (and the corresponding contribution margin) did not change much over the past decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What was significant was fixed cost control. Over the past decade, fixed cost margin declined (improved) with the 2024 margin of 33% compared to the 46% in 2015.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other characteristic of its cost structure was the high operating leverage, with fixed costs accounting for about half of the total cost (fixed + variable). This meant that additional revenue will have a multiplier impact on profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q3 2025, operating profit rose 19% year-on-year on an 18.9% revenue increase, confirming that operating leverage remains strong even as gross margins plateau near 55%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, the decade-long trend suggests an underlying efficient business model. Given the projected revenue growth discussed earlier, it is reasonable to expect that profit growth will remain strong and sustainable.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"828\" data-height=\"241\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart 1: Margins and Operating Profit Profile\" width=\"640\" height=\"186\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"186\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Chart 1: Margins and Operating Profit Profile <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Note to Op Profit Model. I broke down the operating profits into fixed costs and variable costs.</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em>Fixed cost = SG&amp;A, R&amp;D, Depreciation <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"&amp;\" htloopnumber=\"759366235\">&amp;</em> Amortization.</em></li> <li><em>Variable cost = Cost of Sales - Depreciation and Amortization.</em></li> <li><em>Contribution = Revenue – Variable Cost.</em></li> <li><em>Contribution margin = Contribution/Revenue.</em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The PAT growth rate was higher than that for the operating profit because of the $1.2 billion tax credit in 2024. This tax credit arose mainly from share-based compensation deductions and R&amp;D-related tax incentives. The tax credit was not from one-off accounting reversals or deferred tax releases. Excluding the tax credit and assuming the “normal” tax rate, the PAT growth rate from 2015 to 2024 is about 34% CAGR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having said that, it is instructive to note that the effective tax rate over the past decade (excluding the tax credit year) was about 12%. This is much lower than the nominal tax rate because of its global footprint, tax-efficient operating structure, and recurring credits tied to R&amp;D and stock-based compensation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, the lower tax rate can be considered part of the business setup and expected to be sustained.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Peer analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I compared MPS’s performance with the following publicly listed peers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">i) Analog Devices: This is a high-performance analog/mixed-signal giant supplying precision/power solutions into industrial, automotive, and data-center systems.

From 2015 to 2024, while it generated an annual positive cash flow from operations every year, it did not have a good cash flow conversion ratio. During this period, it only generated $2.9 billion in cash flow from operations compared to its cumulative PAT of $3.4 billion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Prospects</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The outlook for MPS appears highly favorable, supported by growth drivers and sustained competitive advantages. Its historical performance has been driven by strong execution rather than cyclical tailwinds, and there is little evidence to suggest a reversal of this trajectory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">i) Market growth. Demand for power-management ICs in data centers, EVs, and industrial automation would provide long-term growth opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ii) Market share gains. Continuous innovation and customer integration should enable MPS to capture share from larger analog competitors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">iii) Margin resilience. I expect a continuation of its strong cost discipline and high operating leverage. This would support sustained profitability and scalable earnings growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">iv) Geographic diversification. While China remains its largest market, expanding exposure in North America and Europe would gradually reducing concentration risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">v) Earnings visibility. Its long-term customer programs, a debt-free balance sheet, and recurring tax benefits underpin high earnings and cash flow predictability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In sum, MPS’s prospects remain strongly positive. The company’s moats - proprietary IP, customer embeddedness, and capital efficiency - are enduring and self-reinforcing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While cyclical risks from the semiconductor demand environment cannot be ruled out, MPS’s business model is positioned to compound value structurally, not cyclically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recent results suggest that while structural growth continues, MPS’s revenue trajectory has normalized to the high-teens range, reflecting broad-based demand rather than outsized data center momentum.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The value of MPS would depend on the profit trajectory. In this context, I assumed a picture tied to its historical performance. The key assumptions are as follows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">i) The base revenue would be the 2024 revenue. Over the valuation period (Year 1 to the terminal value in Year 6), revenue would grow at 23.2% CAGR. This is about the historical growth rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ii) The base EBIT margin would be based on the 2022 to 2024 average of 27%. I assumed that this would improve proportionately so that in the terminal year, it would match the peer's best historical average of 41%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">iii) The based capital turnover would be the 2022 to 2024 average value</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">iv) The base Reinvestment would be the past decade's average Reinvestment margin. The Reinvestment rate would improve proportionately so that in the terminal year, it would follow that of the fundamental growth equation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">v) The tax rate would be the past decade's average tax rate (excluding 2024).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On such a basis I obtained an intrinsic value of $725 per share compared to the market price of $1,094 per share (29 Oct 2025). There is no margin of safety</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation model</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I value MPS based on a multi-stage valuation model as illustrated in Table 3.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"786\" data-height=\"168\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Table 3: Sample valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"137\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"137\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Table 3: Sample valuation <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Notes to Table 3.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>a.

This is because in the terminal year:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">i) MPS would deliver an EBIT margin of 44%. Its past decade high was only 29%. Given that margins appear to have stabilized (as per the Q3 2025 results) in the mid-30s operating range, my prior assumption of margin expansion toward peer highs may be very optimistic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ii) MPS would have a 101% return on capital. The peer best over the past decade was by Texas Instruments with 47% in 2018.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">iii) MPS would have an EPS of $57 per share. Its decade best was $9 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite an aggressive set of assumptions, there is no margin of safety. The market has overpriced the business.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MPS represents a rare combination of sustained organic growth, structural efficiency, and durable competitive advantages in the analog semiconductor space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the past decade, the company has compounded revenue at 23% annually, translating this into even stronger profit. This was achieved through disciplined cost control and operating leverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its competitive edge rests on proprietary power-management architectures, deep customer integration, and an asset-light, fabless model that allows consistent reinvestment into innovation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, MPS’s core markets remain structurally attractive. These - data centers, automotive, and industrial systems - are driven by rising power density, electrification, and AI-related demand. These tailwinds, combined with the company’s engineering-led culture and design-in model, support a strong likelihood of continued double-digit growth.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, from an investment perspective, much of this strength already appears priced into the stock. Even when modelled with optimistic growth and margin assumptions, intrinsic value estimates offer little to no margin of safety relative to current market levels.

That makes 35 for the year so far. We had a strong finish for October after a strong showing in the traditionally weak month<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> of September.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As is customary, I will look at the various asset classes, sectors, equity categories, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and stocks that moved the market higher and the market segments that defied the trend by moving lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Identifying the pockets of strength and weakness allows us to see the direction of significant money flows and their origin. This is helpful in a trending market like we have today, as opposed to a choppy, directionless market. Once a trend gets going, it usually continues until something fundamentally changes the direction of the trend.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>S&amp;P 500 had a tepid week</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I said at the top, the market made two new high last week. With the government shutdown, a weakening employment picture, and still unresolved tariff negotiations, investors are assuming that the so-called ‘Fed put’ is still in play. But I beg to differ. With the budget deficit and national debt so high, the Fed will be reluctant to add any meaningful stimulus or do any rescuing of banks or brokers who get into trouble.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/150144-17619653989460504.png?io=w640\" alt=\"S&amp;P 500 last 4 weeks\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"482\" height=\"289\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/150144-17619653989460504.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/150144-17619653989460504.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/150144-17619653989460504.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/150144-17619653989460504.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/150144-17619653989460504.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/150144-17619653989460504.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/150144-17619653989460504.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/150144-17619653989460504.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author compilation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Zoom out to 12 months</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This chart shows the monthly returns for the past year.

A gain is a gain, as they say, but recently the market has been doing better than 0.7%. My message to Mr. Market is… Try harder! We don’t want to meander higher. We want to rocket higher, valuations be damned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of valuations, we’re getting up there. We’re close to 1999 caliber valuations. Can we surpass that ceiling? Of course we can. But be aware that there is a price to pay for buying richly valued stocks. The returns going forward hardly ever reach the highs that are achieved when starting valuations are more reasonable. It just makes intuitive sense.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>To recap the last 2 week’s action, investors were:</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><span>Selling foreign markets and buying NASDAQ stocks</span></li> <li><span>Selling REITs and buying blockchain companies</span></li> <li><span>Selling Consumer Staples and buying Tech</span></li> <li><span>Selling dividend yield and buying high-beta stocks</span></li> <li><span>Selling Value and buying Growth</span></li> <li><span>Selling Gold &amp; Silver and buying Crude oil</span></li> <li><span>Selling France and buying Brazil</span></li> <li><span>Selling uranium and buying lithium</span></li> <li><span>Selling Defensive and buying Cyclical stocks</span></li> </ul>",

Since then, I’m not fazed at all by Talkspace’s recent rally: its acceleration in growth still paves the path for an upward multiple re-rating on a still-low base valuation, as the company continues to penetrate into more health insurance plans and boost its number of payor sessions. I’m reiterating my buy rating here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Historically, Talkspace is a stock that has generated a lot of skepticism from the markets. Investment momentum has steered away from smaller, unproven companies like Talkspace and into large cap AI plays. But now, Talkspace is showcasing a number of advantages that are becoming more difficult to ignore. In my view, here are the top reasons to be bullish on Talkspace:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Talkspace enjoys secular tailwinds in the destigmatization of mental health.</strong> More and more people are seeking talk therapy as a part of their overall wellness journey, which is leading to a substantial jump in the number of sessions conducted on the Talkspace platform.</li> <li> <strong>Great medium for talk therapy.</strong> Arguably, of all the online telehealth services, mental health is the most conducive to being conducted virtually, offering convenience for both patients and providers without sacrificing quality of care.</li> <li> <strong>Expanding coverage.</strong> The company also benefits from secular tailwinds of more health insurance plans covering mental health services.</li> <li> <strong>Expanding opportunities in psychiatry.</strong> Talkspace is expanding aggressively beyond traditional talk therapy and psychology, and widening its services to include medical psychiatry.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite its wellspring of strengths, Talkspace still trades at modest revenue multiples, as the company sits just at the cusp of improving its monetization and boosting its profitability. At current share prices near $3, Talkspace trades at a market cap of $540.9 million. After we net off the $91.6 million of cash on the company’s latest balance sheet, Talkspace’s resulting <strong>enterprise value is $449.3 million.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For FY25, Talkspace has boosted the midpoint of its revenue guidance to $226-230 million (20-23% growth), versus a wider 17-25% range previously, while also narrowing its adjusted EBITDA to a $14-16 million range that implies a 6.6% midpoint margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2206\" data-height=\"1210\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Talkspace outlook\" width=\"640\" height=\"351\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"351\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Talkspace outlook <span>(Talkspace Q3 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For next year, FY26, Wall Street is expecting the company to hit $276.4 million (+21% y/y), and if we conservatively assume a ~2 point adjusted EBITDA margin expansion to 8.5% margins (in line with the company’s Q3 margins), adjusted EBITDA in FY26 would be $23.5 million. This puts Talkspace’s valuation multiples at:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>2.0x</strong> EV/FY25 revenue and <strong>1.6x</strong> EV/FY26 revenue</li> <li> <strong>30x</strong> EV/FY25 adjusted EBITDA and <strong>19x</strong> EV/FY26 adjusted EBITDA</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For a company riding multiple secular tailwinds and achieving accelerating revenue growth, I continue to see a fantastic opportunity to buy Talkspace at a still-deflated valuation. Stay long here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Download</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s now go through Talkspace’s latest quarterly results in greater detail.

Talkspace's revenue growth also accelerated seven points versus just 18% y/y growth in Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's number of payor members (that is, members who are part of a covered health plan) rose 30% y/y to 121k, while the number of payor sessions on the platform expanded at a rapid 37% y/y clip. The company is not only adding new patients, but also benefiting from increased regularity of sessions conducted on the platform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2168\" data-height=\"1208\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Talkspace payor growth\" width=\"640\" height=\"357\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"357\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Talkspace payor growth <span>(Talkspace Q3 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Psychiatry continues to be a critical growth avenue for the company, with more of the company's payor members taking advantage of these offerings. Per CEO Dr. Jon Cohen's remarks on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835792-talkspace-inc-talk-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q3 earnings call:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Payer revenue in this quarter also benefited from strength in our psychiatry business, which we relaunched earlier this year to address the needs of our high acuity users and those that need medication. As a result of these initiatives, psychiatry initial session volume increased 46% in the quarter. Further, we grew our psychiatry network of providers by nearly 50% from Q2, and we'll continue growing that part of the network given the demand trends we are seeing. We continue to focus on optimizing the internal referral funnel between therapy and psychiatry services, and we expect continued growth in the coming quarters.\"</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has also rolled out a number of AI-enabled features, including a new tool that helps patients determine their insurance eligibility. Despite the raft of growth levers that Talkspace is pulling, the company is still growing with efficiency in mind. The chart below showcases that opex remained relatively flat y/y at $22.4 million, representing 34% of revenue and a decline of 7 points y/y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2154\" data-height=\"1136\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Talkspace adjusted EBITDA\" width=\"640\" height=\"338\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"338\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Talkspace adjusted EBITDA <span>(Talkspace Q3 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, the company's adjusted EBITDA more than doubled y/y to $5.0 million, reflecting an 8.4% adjusted EBITDA margin. In my view, Talkspace is still in the early innings of hitting its profit stride, as greater session frequency will allow Talkspace to generate substantial economies of scale on its investments in its technology platform.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Takeaways</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Talkspace may be an overlooked stock, but investors who are keen to invest in value names in an expensive stock market should take advantage of this name before its growth rate and profit expansion make it more of a mainstream company. Talkspace benefits from multiple growth levers and secular tailwinds, and is quickly becoming a household name with few at-scale competitors. Stay long here.</p>",

Historically, CRE transaction volumes in the U.S. and Europe have moved in tandem, and when gaps emerge, they tend to normalize quickly. Signs are now emerging that Europe may be on the cusp of doing just that. The number of European transactions under contract in October reached its highest level since 2022, and the Q3 2025 INREV Consensus Survey showed a meaningful rebound in investor sentiment, driven by improved financing conditions and increasing market liquidity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Year-over-year change in quarterly CRE transaction volume</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>1Q 2008–present</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1105\" data-height=\"476\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Year-over-year change in quarterly CRE transaction volume\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"276\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr class=\"bg-g\"> <th> </th> <th>3Q25</th> <th>YTD</th> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>Office</td> <td>+5%</td> <td>+3%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Industrial</td> <td>-29%</td> <td>-8%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Retail</td> <td>-13%</td> <td>+4%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Apartment</td> <td>-24%</td> <td>-9%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hotel</td> <td>+11%</td> <td>-9%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Data Centers</td> <td>+15%</td> <td>-1%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sr. Housing</td> <td>-14%</td> <td>+41%</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Resilience in residential, early office recovery</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Residential investment was a notable bright spot of the October release, reflecting investor rotation toward counter-cyclical, supply-constrained assets. The sector’s resilience was underscored in the INREV Consensus Indicator Survey, where residential ranked as the most preferred sector in Q3 2025 for the third consecutive quarter. Reflecting this momentum, residential-focused European funds delivered top-tier total returns: +2% in Q2 and +8% year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While office investment remained close to historical lows in absolute terms, there is the emergence of some green shoots. Volumes rose 5% in Q3 and 3% YTD, with London and Paris central business districts leading the way. Prices are rebounding, and prime rents are showing notable growth in 1H25. Similar signs of stabilization are emerging in supply-constrained markets, such as Madrid and Amsterdam, as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Adjacent to the traditional real estate sectors, data centers continue to gain momentum. Transaction volumes rose by +15% in Q3 and were flat on a year-to-date basis, an impressive result given the broader market softness. Data centers increasingly blur the lines between real estate and infrastructure: they offer long-term contracted revenue, essential service functions, high barriers to entry, and leases that are based on power availability rather than traditional CRE that’s measured by the size of the usage area. These attributes make them especially attractive as Europe ramps up digital and energy infrastructure investment. As part of real estate, infrastructure, or “digital real asset” strategies, investors should expect data centers to continue seeing inflows in the quarters ahead. That said, these transactions are typically large and occur infrequently, making quarterly fluctuations volatile and not necessarily indicative of medium- to long-term trends.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Europe’s CRE market may be lagging the U.S., but momentum is building beneath the surface. With liquidity returning, investor sentiment improving, and capital flowing into resilient and forward-looking sectors such as residential, prime offices, and data centers, the foundations for recovery appear to be taking shape. If current trends persist, Europe’s transaction activity is well-positioned to accelerate into 2026, potentially closing the gap with the U.S. and emerging on firmer footing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.principalam.com/us/insights/real-estate/europe-cre-deal-volume-down-3q-green-shoots-emerge\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

Here, in the MoPay batch, lie affordable (yet<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> volatile and risky) bargains.

Thus, the Dogcatcher yield-based strategy for this MoPay group, as graded by broker estimates this month, proved 40% accurate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Estimated dividend payouts from $1000 invested in each of the ten highest-yielding stocks, plus analysts median 1yr target prices for those stocks, as reported by YCharts, produced the gain estimates below. (Note: target prices from lone analysts were not counted.)

Thus, the highest yielding stocks in any collection became known as \"dogs.\" More specifically, these are, in fact, best called \"underdogs\".</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>October Monthly Pay Dividend Data</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Three lists produce numerous actionable conclusions and several more un-numbered results. To draw these conclusions and results, September 29, 2025 closing prices and estimated annual dividends were referenced from YCharts. In the process, monthly pay equity (1) yield and (2) upside potential lists were compared and contrasted against (3) the high yield (and higher risk) MoPay CEICs/ETFs/ETNs list.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Monthly Pay Dividend Qualities</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Quarterly, Semi-Annual and Annual dividend investors anxiously await announcements from a firm, fund, or brokerage to learn if their next dividend will be higher, lower, or paid at all.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Monthly pay stocks, funds, trusts, and partnerships inform the holder every four and one third weeks by check and/or statement. If the entity reduces or suspends a payment, the holder can sell out of the investment immediately to avoid future loss of income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This advantage has been curtailed when companies suddenly cut monthly dividends to save cash. Numerous prominent MoPay firms declared dividend cuts between May and June, 2020, including: Oxford Square Capital Corp; Partners Real Estate Investment Trust; Orchid Island Capital Inc; Cross Timbers Royalty Trust; H&amp;R Real Estate Investment Trust; BTB Real Estate Investment Trust; American Finance Trust Inc; Mesa Royalty Trust; Solar Senior Capital Ltd; Ellington Financial Inc; Dividend Select 15 Corp; Chesswood Group Ltd; Sabine Royalty Trust; TORC Oil &amp; Gas Ltd; Freehold Royalties Ltd; ARC Resources Ltd; Inter Pipeline Ltd; San Juan Basin Royalty Trust; Ag Growth International.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Former MoPay top ten regular by yield. Bluerock Residential announced December 2019 it was retreating to quarterly dividend payments \"in keeping with industry tradition.\" Bluerock Residential company has since gone private and is no longer listed publicly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That \"industry tradition\" continued with Armour Residential REIT and Stellus Capital Investment Corp both transitioned to Q Pay in June, 2020. Within three months, however, both SCM and ARR returned to MoPay mode.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top yield stock for July, 2018, June 2021, and December 2023, Orchid Island Capital, released this cautionary note with its monthly dividend announcements back in 2018: \"The Company has not established a minimum distribution payment level and is not assured of its ability to make distributions to stockholders in the future.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ORC directors proceeded to back-up their words with actions cutting the dividend from $0.14 to $0.11 in February, to $0.09 in March, to $0.08 in September, 2018, and to $0.055 for May, 2020. However in August. 2020 ORC monthly dividend increased from $0.06 to $0.065 for September, October, and into 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ORC, however, currently pays a $0.12 monthly dividend (falling from $0.16 in October, 2023) and is again listed here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The U.S. stock market MoPay segment is volatile, transitive, recovering, and since 2024 has achieved recovery to near full strength. More trades in monthly pay equities are available from Canadian firms, many of which are also listed on U.S. OTC (pink sheet) exchanges.

Last month they were 4% lower. Last June they were 1% higher. The price differences are caused by the outlandishly high dividends offered by a few of the top equities or funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This month the top fund dividend is at 36.14%, whereas the top equity pays just 20.09%. Nevertheless, equities are usually cheaper than funds because equities are not loaded with the high overhead costs of fund management.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Background and Actionable Conclusions</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In June 2012 readers suggested the author include these funds, trusts, and partnerships in the MoPay article.

AI, for example, depends heavily on how quickly data centers and power grid infrastructure can be built. Widespread adoption of EVs, for its part, requires charging systems and supportive electrical grid infrastructure. Meanwhile, rising trade tensions have countries racing to expand domestic manufacturing for strategic technologies, such as AI chips and EV batteries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, supporting larger, more urban populations while mitigating impacts from climate change requires a staggering amount of infrastructure, such as modernized power grids, clean water infrastructure, and residential buildings. It is estimated that roughly half of the buildings that will need to exist globally by 2050 have yet to be constructed.<sup>3</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Through 2040, investments totaling $106 trillion may be needed to meet the world’s infrastructure needs.<sup>4</sup> Transport and logistics infrastructure have the highest projected investment requirements at $36 trillion. Energy and power infrastructure require an estimated $23 trillion, while digital infrastructure, such as data centers, could require nearly $20 trillion.<sup>5</sup> Social infrastructure, including schools, healthcare facilities, and housing, as well as waste and water, agriculture, and defense infrastructure, could also require trillions in investments.<sup> 6</sup></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global Fragmentation Creates New Development Opportunities for U.S. Manufacturing Facilities</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The boost for infrastructure development from rising trade fragmentation is particularly evident in the United States. In just the first eight months of the second Trump administration, companies announced nearly $1.25 trillion in investments to expand their U.S. manufacturing footprints.<sup>7</sup> Key drivers of this trend are rising geopolitical tensions and shifting federal policies, particularly the implementation of the administration’s extensive tariff scheme.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the announcements span a variety of industries, much of the planning pipeline is concentrated in strategic areas. Consumer electronics leads with more than $700 billion in announced U.S. investments, although the category is heavily concentrated in just two companies.<sup>8</sup> Pharmaceutical manufacturing investments total $290 billion across 18 announcements from both domestic and international drugmakers. Semiconductor manufacturers account for 11% of announced investments, with plans to spend $134 billion on top of the $300 billion announced prior to 2025.<sup>9,10</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of July 2025, construction spending on manufacturing accounted for just under 15% of total private construction spending in the United States, a 2.5x increase from January 2021.<sup>11,12</sup> We believe the flurry of investments over 2025 could push manufacturing’s share of construction spending higher over the medium to long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"4270\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251010 - Charting Disruption_02-2.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"820\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aging Infrastructure Is a Common Concern for Developed Economies, Including the United States</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Decades-old assets can slow economic growth and hamper the adoption of disruptive technologies. For example, even though electricity can be viewed as essential to economic and social progress, power grids are frequently underfunded and outdated.<sup>13</sup> In Japan, over two-thirds of transmission infrastructure is at least 20 years old. Nearly half of all transmission infrastructure in the United States and over 40% of assets in the European Union are also at least two decades old.<sup>14</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the United States, inadequate infrastructure conditions extend well beyond the power grid. Despite increased funding over the past four years, the American Society of Civil Engineers only improved the country’s overall infrastructure grade from a C- in 2021 to a C in 2025.<sup>15</sup> Half of the assessed categories received either a D or D+, translating to “Poor, At Risk” status. This means that these nationwide systems are in fair to poor condition and “mostly below standard, with many elements approaching the end of their service life.”<sup>16</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Improving the quality of infrastructure in the United States alone could require $9.1 trillion in investments between 2024 and 2033. Over $5 trillion in funding has been allocated, meaning that a multi-trillion-dollar investment gap still needs to be filled by additional public and private spending.<sup>17</sup> Similarly, the European Union faces a $2 trillion infrastructure investment gap when considering expected infrastructure development needs and announced funding through 2040.<sup>18</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"3514\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251010 - Charting Disruption_03-1.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Infrastructure Renaissance Could Emerge from Surging Public and Private Investment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global infrastructure development is increasingly pivotal to the economies of the future. The adoption of disruptive technologies such as AI, the reshoring of strategic supply chains, and the growth of urban populations all depend on how quickly supportive infrastructure can be built. As these demands rise, so too could opportunities for companies – and investors – across the infrastructure development value chain. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Green, A., Nangia, J. &amp; Sandri, N.
