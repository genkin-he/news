Note that the fourth quarter of 2025 includes a shutdown in government spending due to the debates taking place in Washington, D.C. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The compound rate of growth of real GDP since the third quarter of 2009 was 2.5 percent. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The recessionary experience of 2020 in 2022 is attributed to the spread of COVID-19, followed by the shortest recession...two months...in U.S. history. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even including this period of time in calculating the year-over-year rate of growth of the economy for the extended period of time does not drop the compound rate of growth for the whole period from 2.5 percent. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have chosen this period out because Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke initiated a \"new\" approach to monetary policy that he introduced around the third quarter of 2009.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bernanke's policy approach has been in place for the whole period of time. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bernanke's approach has been for the Federal Reserve to choose a target for the Fed's outright purchase of securities for its portfolio. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Federal Reserve engaged in three rounds of quantitative easing before the U.S. economy began to slow down and then one round of quantitative easing to combat the economic disruptions coming around the 2020-2022 period. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then in March 2022, the Federal Reserve began a policy of quantitative tightening to combat the inflationary pressures that started following the Fed's very aggressive quantitative easing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In December 2025, the Federal Reserve began another round of quantitative easing...a policy it is following at this time. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bernanke's policy basically freed up the productive capabilities of the United States and sent the U.S. economy into a period of supply-side growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My argument has been, and I have written about this constantly during this period, that the economic growth achieved from the middle of 2009 on to the present time has been driven, not by demand-side spending, etc., but it has been driven by the supply-side of the economy. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unemployment? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, unemployment has been running around 4.0 percent for much of this time period. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is the chart. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-1772050382872909_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1922\" data-height=\"1034\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-1772050382872909_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Unemployment Rate\" width=\"640\" height=\"344\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-1772050382872909_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-1772050382872909_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-1772050382872909_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-1772050382872909_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Unemployment Rate <span>(Federal Reserve)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The latest unemployment rate, for December 2025, was 4.3 percent, down from 4.5 percent in November. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Obviously, the unemployment rate was disturbed by the economic turmoil in the 2020-2022 period, but note that the unemployment rate started to fall as the \"Bernanke\" policy was introduced in 2009 and fell and fell and fell up until the disturbance of 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The unemployment rate dropped below 4.0 percent in the latter part of the 2010s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And here we are in the mid-2020s. The unemployment rate dropped below 4.0 percent again, and although the rate has risen somewhat in the past year, it remains around the 4.0 percent level. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Many experts believe that this 4.0 percent rate can be assumed to be the \"full\" employment rate of unemployment. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, employment seems to be holding its own in this period. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Inflation</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-17720513701371567_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1900\" data-height=\"1042\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-17720513701371567_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"GDP: Explicit Price Deflator\" width=\"640\" height=\"351\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-17720513701371567_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-17720513701371567_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-17720513701371567_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-17720513701371567_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">GDP: Implicit Price Deflator <span>(Federal Reserve)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here we see the inflation rate as given by the Implicit Price Deflator coming from the Gross Domestic Product accounts. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As can be seen, the implicit prices have been rising at a relatively steady rate during this whole period, again the exception coming in the period of economic disturbance...2020-2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What can be seen in this chart is that during the time that the Federal Reserve followed the Bernanke approach to monetary policy, prices remained relatively stable, breaking out only during the period of economic disturbance. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> We would like the rate of inflation to come lower. That is the goal of the Federal Reserve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We need to keep our watch out on the Fed to see that it continues to exert itself to bring the rate of inflation down a little lower. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, in the range of these three measures, the economy of the United States seems to be doing fairly well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Economic growth...OK, around 2.5 percent. Unemployment...maybe a little high at 4.3 percent. Inflation...needs to be brought down closer to 2.0 percent. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's wrong? What is driving discontent? What keeps people unhappy? </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My answer to this is that over the past 40-45 years, the distribution of wealth in the United States has become much more skewed toward the higher income/wealth classes. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is how the lower 50 percent of the wealth distribution has performed over the past 50 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-17720523587766185_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1928\" data-height=\"1012\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-17720523587766185_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Wealth held by bottom 50%\" width=\"640\" height=\"336\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-17720523587766185_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-17720523587766185_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-17720523587766185_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-17720523587766185_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Share of net wealth held by bottom 50% <span>(Federal Reserve)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, here is the share of wealth owned by the top 1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-1772052552697328_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1928\" data-height=\"1046\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-1772052552697328_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Share Held by top 1%\" width=\"640\" height=\"347\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-1772052552697328_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-1772052552697328_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-1772052552697328_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/219293-1772052552697328_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Share of Net Worth Held by top 1% <span>(Federal Reserve)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">How has this shift in the wealth distribution occurred?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, since 2009, we have had a Federal Reserve System, started under the leadership of Chairman Ben Bernanke, who considered that getting the stock market moving was a good start to raising the wealth of consumers.

Since my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4856310-super-micro-stock-most-mispriced-phase-speculative-strong-buy\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4856310-super-micro-stock-most-mispriced-phase-speculative-strong-buy\" target=\"_blank\">last coverage,</a> SMCI is up 10%, and with the strong quarter from Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) with revenue growth to record levels and Blackwell demand extending into next year, it is easy to believe that the company is simply a leveraged play on the demand for AI infrastructure.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, underneath this <span id=\"jS$77\" class=\"j3\">hypergrowth,</span> margins have compressed significantly to ~6% from 9.5% in Q1, indicating potential headwinds from customer concentration and supply issues. The investment thesis is contingent upon margin improvement and a shift in mix towards more value-infused infrastructure solutions.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue is Real but Quality is More Important</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is no question about the revenue growth. Q2 revenue was <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865500-super-micro-computer-inc-smci-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865500-super-micro-computer-inc-smci-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">$12.68 billion</a>, significantly above guidance, and the company guided to at least $40 billion in revenue for the upcoming fiscal year. AI GPU platforms accounted for more than 90% of revenue, highlighting the company’s strong alignment with the Nvidia and AMD roadmaps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the nature of the company’s revenue composition does require more scrutiny. For example, the company had one large data center customer that comprised <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001375365/603e5882-b841-4776-a351-353b2005cdd1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001375365/603e5882-b841-4776-a351-353b2005cdd1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">about 63%</a> of the company’s total revenue in the second quarter. This type of concentration, by itself, already poses considerable volatility risk. Although the company did signal that diversification efforts are underway, such high levels of concentration mean that the deployment timing of one single customer can already cause considerable volatility in the company’s results.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856686559982_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1858\" data-height=\"388\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856686559982_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SMCI\" width=\"640\" height=\"134\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856686559982_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856686559982_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856686559982_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856686559982_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SMCI 10Q</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of geographic dispersion, the company derived 86% of its revenue from the US, although Europe also declined considerably on a year-over-year basis. This also means that the company is likely seeing considerable hyperscale data center build-outs in the US, which are currently the primary drivers of the company’s business. However, if sovereign AI rollouts are undertaken in Europe and the Middle East, the company’s expanded manufacturing footprint in Malaysia, Taiwan, and the Netherlands also provides considerable leverage. However, the company’s primary source of revenue remains the large data center rollouts in the US.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I find more interesting, however, is the company’s shift to Rack Scale Systems and the emergence of Data Center Building Block Solutions. Although not discussed in the company’s earnings call, the company did reveal that Data Center Building Block Solutions comprised about 4% of the company’s profit in the first half of FY2026, which could increase to double-digit profit contribution by the end of 2026. With the company’s gross margins on <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/818/120818/original.pdf\" title=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/818/120818/original.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">DCBBS</a> already exceeding 20%, compared to the company’s mid-single-digit average, this is where the company’s business model really begins to change from one that is merely reselling hardware to one that is more integrated. However, this remains prospective and not actual.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856694124396_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1730\" data-height=\"966\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856694124396_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SMCI\" width=\"640\" height=\"357\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856694124396_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856694124396_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856694124396_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49853134-17720856694124396_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FQ2 2026 Results</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margin Compression: Temporary Friction or Structural Reality?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The major challenge in this quarter has been margin compression. The company has seen a decrease in its non-GAAP gross margin, now standing at 6.4%. The company has cited this as a result of customer mix, expedited transport costs, component shortages, and tariff effects. Some of these effects are likely cyclical in nature. The expedited transport cost for initial GP300 shipments will normalize over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, the customer mix is not entirely temporary. Large model builders and hyperscalers have enormous price leverage. When 63% of revenue comes from one customer, the bargaining dynamics are not symmetrical. Such structural pressure is exerted on the company’s margins unless there is substantial differentiation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating expenses were impressively managed at 1.9% of revenue in the most recent quarter on a non-GAAP basis. This is indicative of substantial operating leverage. The company’s non-GAAP operating margins were at 4.5%, down from 5.4% in the prior quarter’s Q1. Nevertheless, such substantial scale is indicative of economies of scale. The pertinent question is whether these economies would be sufficient to offset the company’s gross margins in the mid-range.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6f0a350279ada8b1cd88c0e42f3b6fa0.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6f0a350279ada8b1cd88c0e42f3b6fa0.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6f0a350279ada8b1cd88c0e42f3b6fa0.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6f0a350279ada8b1cd88c0e42f3b6fa0.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s free cash flow came in at negative $45 million due to the build-up in inventory to $10.6 billion and increased receivables. The cash conversion cycle has come down dramatically from 123 days to 54 days. Nevertheless, this is aided by the long payables cycle. The company’s net debt has increased to $787 million. Nevertheless, the company has secured multiple credit facilities aggregating to nearly $4 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, the company is in the land-grab phase. The company is deliberately accepting lower margins to acquire market share in the unprecedented AI infrastructure cycle. Such a strategy is workable provided the company’s higher-margin DCBBS and diversification into the enterprise segment are achieved quickly.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Platform Transition and Competitive Positioning</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the coming days, SMCI is gearing up to support Nvidia’s Vera Rubin platform as well as AMD’s Helios platform. The company is seeing strong visibility with customers for the second half. Historically, the company has prided itself on delivering total solutions to the marketplace several months before the reference architecture is available.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The underlying question is differentiation. Nvidia provides the underlying compute. SMCI provides the integration of compute, cooling, power, and rack-scale solutions. DCBBS is a natural extension of this, providing cooling distribution units, power shelves, battery backup, and data center management software.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a very strategically intelligent move for SMCI. Time to online is a very important factor for data center customers, and the same goes for increasing efficiencies around power consumption. If SMCI can successfully position itself as a one-stop shop for AI factory builders, not simply a server vendor, then its margin structure could improve significantly.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation: Cheap for the Growth, Expensive for the Margins</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At current multiples, SMCI is trading at a significant discount to its peers for FY2027 earnings, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMCI/earnings\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMCI/earnings\" target=\"_blank\">around 11x</a>. On a forward P/S multiple, SMCI is also attractive at just 0.45x 2026 revenues, especially given its exposure to the AI trend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the way to think about this name is not in isolation from its underlying margin structure. A 6% to 7% gross margin business deserves a very different multiple than a 20% to 30% infrastructure business. If the gross margin improves to the high single digits and DCBBS grows to a double-digit profit contribution, there could be significant earnings potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see the valuation as fair. It assumes strong growth but not explosive margin growth. There is upside if DCBBS ramps up faster than expected. There is risk if hyperscaler pricing pressure continues.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_187d9515f3ebbd09f9fe61c7ed3af01a.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_187d9515f3ebbd09f9fe61c7ed3af01a.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_187d9515f3ebbd09f9fe61c7ed3af01a.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_187d9515f3ebbd09f9fe61c7ed3af01a.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks: When Hypergrowth Meets Hidden Fragility</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I see as the biggest risk is customer concentration. A change in deployment schedules by the 63% customer could introduce volatility in revenue and working capital. In a period with this much growth, visibility can change quickly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margin pressure could be more persistent than management expects. If component shortages continue or hyperscalers continue to pressure pricing, gross margin recovery could be slower than expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The inventory position of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865500-super-micro-computer-inc-smci-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865500-super-micro-computer-inc-smci-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">$10.6 billion</a> is large. Management points to this as a position to take advantage of in the Q3 upswing. Any slowdown in demand could stress the company's working capital position. They have been proactive in increasing credit lines, and leverage is increasing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the DOJ risk and corporate governance risk continue as an overhang. While the company is performing well operationally, investors could demand a risk premium until the corporate governance situation improves.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Super Micro is executing in the middle of the most powerful AI infrastructure in decades. They are growing revenue. They have excellent visibility in demand. However, I see margin risk and customer concentration risk. I see this as a Hold. I consider buying in at the insider levels provides speculative upside.</p>",

One of these is margin compression, since intense competition in the chosen segment is pushing net margins down to 3.1% from 6.9% a year earlier. This means SMCI's stock is dealing with what you might call a \"growth quality crisis.\" In addition to analyzing Super Micro's growth drivers, competition, and financial profile, the purpose of this article is to assess its potential value and analyze key business risks in 2026. In spite of the challenges it faces, it has the potential to improve the operational and economic efficiency of its core business, allowing it to offset the loss of its previous margin and increase its market value. Meanwhile, its rapidly growing market and offering of more unique solutions for servers and data center cooling allow us to give SMCI shares a \"Buy\" rating.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SMCI's Strategy and Growth Drivers</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As one of the global leaders in the high-performance server and data storage segment, Super Micro's role is growing in line with the ongoing AI supercycle and the development of related infrastructure. Its business portfolio includes three key areas: AI server solutions, liquid cooling technologies, and Building Block Solutions. AI servers are a key area for generating cash flow for SMCI, with the company developing and assembling server equipment optimized for use with graphics processing units, notably from NVIDIA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Within the first area, we have developed the Building Block Solutions concept, using a modular approach to building AI server architecture. An advantage of this product is the high speed of assembly of servers tailored to the individual configurations of each customer, ensuring the proper efficiency of the equipment in the future. DLC emerged separately from the development of AI servers; however, growing demand for the company's solutions is precisely due to the construction of new data centers. Operating chips in their infrastructure generates a huge amount of heat, which SMCI's liquid cooling systems allow centers to operate more efficiently and without unexpected shutdowns and failures. Furthermore, implementation of the company's DLC reduces energy costs for the cooling system itself and enables more chips and computing power to be placed in a smaller data center footprint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In analyzing the catalysts for SMCI's strategic growth in 2026, we should point out the main short-term driver related to NVIDIA's Blackwell update. <a href=\"https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/finterra-2026-1-28-the-liquid-cooled-titan-a-deep-dive-into-super-micro-computers-smci-2026-recovery-and-ai-dominance\" rel=\"nofollow\">The data shows that at the beginning of 2026, its order book for these systems is around $13 billion.</a> That's thanks to Building Block Solutions, where it can get ready-made servers based on these chips up and running about a month faster than its competitors, and that's a key thing in the race between hyperscalers. In addition to the driver from the Blackwell update, another important growth catalyst for SMCI is the increasing demand for highly efficient liquid cooling systems. It is because chips are becoming more powerful than 1000 W, and traditional cooling mechanisms are physically unable to cope with this. Right now, this <a href=\"https://www.supermicro.com/en/pressreleases/supermicro-begins-volume-shipments-max-performance-servers-optimized-ai-hpc\" rel=\"nofollow\">company has set up the world's largest production of liquid-cooled racks (with up to 5000 racks per month)</a>, allowing it to keep up with growing demand. The global cooling systems market is expected to reach $21 billion in revenue by 2026, growing to $54 billion by 2034, estimates Fortune Business. Around 35% of all spending on cooling components is related to AI computing infrastructure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that SMCI's main challenge is the contraction of its marginal business, investments in the launch of more cost-effective production facilities are emerging as key growth drivers. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4809193-super-micro-computer-inc-smci-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">This includes the launch of a new plant in Malaysia, expected to take place in the second half of 2026.</a> Economic benefits of the project will be reflected in lower costs, particularly labor and taxes (when compared to the US and Taiwan). Moreover, SMCI's management expects the launch of this plant to boost revenue to $40 billion in 2026. The increase in revenue will be accompanied by economies of scale, with even a minimal improvement in operating efficiency from lower costs significantly improving EPS.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Competition for SMCI</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Analyzing SMCI's competitive environment, we should understand that the company faces competition in the production of servers for AI infrastructure and liquid cooling systems. The competition can be classified into 3 key groups: global technology giants, Asian players, and indirect competitors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Groups of global technology giants are SMCI's most direct competitors, since they are all fighting for orders from large enterprises and government agencies. Dell Technologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DELL\" title=\"Dell Technologies Inc.\">DELL</a>) will be the main competitor, currently pursuing an aggressive policy to capture an increasing share of the AI server market. For this purpose, the company is leveraging its huge corporate customer base and the best global supply chain. The other global competitor from the US is Hewlett Packard Enterprise (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPE\" title=\"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company\">HPE</a>), with competitive advantages in the high-performance computing segment. By acquiring Juniper Networks, it strengthened its position in AI networking solutions, which allows it to offer data centers more comprehensive infrastructure packages.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A group of Asian players is led by technology giant Lenovo Group. The company focuses on hybrid cloud solutions and offers more flexible pricing, one of the main reasons for the decline in margins for SMCI and other US companies. Asian competitors also include Inspur (the largest server manufacturer in China, which dominates the domestic market) and Giga Computing (providing solutions for custom GPU servers and developing solutions to support new NVIDIA and AMD chips). ASUS and Foxconn are also worth mentioning among Asian players, however, as they often act as contract manufacturers. Their main target audience is the lower and middle price segments. Generally speaking, the common characteristic of all Asian competitors is their cheaper offerings, due to lower production costs resulting from economies of scale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Indirect competitors include hyperscalers, such as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, that are not only major customers for SMCI's AI servers and cooling systems but also engage in their own internal development. In fact, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft are developing their own server architectures for their own chips (Trainium, Inferentia, TPU, and Maia). Their goal is to make hyperscalers less dependent on outside contractors, particularly since most of the manufacturers are in Asia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the future of competition, the <a href=\"https://my.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS54034325\" rel=\"nofollow\">total revenue for the server market hit another record high of $112.4 billion in Q3 2025</a>. Plus, suppliers' revenue went up 61% compared to Q3 2024. The US remains the main server market, growing by 79.1%, compared to China's more modest growth of 37.6%. Analyzing the structure of the competition, note that Dell remains the main player in the server market, accounting for 8.3% of the market, compared to 9.7% a year earlier. Meanwhile, SMCI is the second-largest company in the world in terms of sales of OEM products for servers, with revenue falling by 13.2%, reflecting the impact of margin compression. While SMCI's share was 7.4% a year earlier, today it is only 4.0%. Moreover, previously, the top 5 companies accounted for 33.3% of the server market, and now they account for 22.6%. The decline in the concentration of key manufacturers in the market is caused by the emergence of an increasing number of local competitors and newcomers from Asia, as well as the internal developments of hyperscalers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-1772061511553959_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"430\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-1772061511553959_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Top 5 Companies, Worldwide Server Market, Third Quarter of 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"274\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-1772061511553959_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-1772061511553959_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-1772061511553959_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-1772061511553959_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Top 5 Companies, Worldwide Server Market, Third Quarter of 2025</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SMCI's Financial Profile</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The financial profile of SMCI's business appeals to me because the company is showing positive momentum in revenue and EPS, which proves that it is capable of not only spending investors' capital but also generating profits. SMCI's status as a key partner of NVIDIA (63% of total revenue) allows it to scale its business, expand production, and move towards supplying individual servers with higher added value. About 84% of the company's total revenue comes from the US domestic market. Nevertheless, even with solid revenue growth, they're dealing with shrinking business margins. As of now, <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/818/120818/original.pdf\">net margins have dropped to 3.1% and gross margins to 6.4%</a>. By comparison, the latter was 11.8% a year earlier. Operating cash flow was negative at $24 million, down $240 million from the same period a year earlier.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-17720616615274801_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"334\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-17720616615274801_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q2 FY2026 Highlights\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"213\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-17720616615274801_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-17720616615274801_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-17720616615274801_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62917110-17720616615274801_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Q2 FY2026 Highlights</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260203844970/en/Supermicro-Announces-Second-Quarter-Fiscal-Year-2026-Financial-Results\" rel=\"nofollow\">Looking at the company's latest financial repor</a>t, we should point out that non-GAAP EPS was $0.69, up $0.20 from the consensus forecast, and revenue was $2.36 billion higher than expected, coming in at $12.7 billion. That's up 122.8% from the same period a year earlier, leading to an increase in the company's forecasts for 2026. Around 90% of SMCI's revenue will continue to come from sales of AI cluster solutions, allowing it to achieve an annual revenue of $36-40 billion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SMCI Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In order to assess the potential value of SMCI shares, we must take into account that using only traditional P/E multiples is unreasonable, given the company's high CAPEX costs. It is therefore worth looking at other multiples, among which are EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA. To analyze the multiples of other companies, let's take a look at SMCI's direct competitors: Dell Technologies and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Name</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Enterprise Value</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>P/E</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>EV/Sales</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>EV/EBITDA</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>SMCI</strong></p></td> <td><p>$19.80В</p></td> <td><p>16.98х</p></td> <td><p>0.48х</p></td> <td><p>10.02х</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>DELL</strong></p></td> <td><p>$101.84В</p></td> <td><p>14.36х</p></td> <td><p>0.91х</p></td> <td><p>8.29х</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>HPE</strong></p></td> <td><p>$46.01В</p></td> <td><p>26.13х</p></td> <td><p>1.13х</p></td> <td><p>6.77х</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Median</strong></p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>19.15х</p></td> <td><p>0.84х</p></td> <td><p>8.36х</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on our assessment, our median P/E ratio is 19.15x, EV/Sales is 0.84x, and EV/EBITDA is 8.36x. These first two SMCI multiples have a discount of 11.3% and 42.9%, respectively, with EV/EBITDA having a premium of 19.8%. This means that if we take the average value, then we get a discount on shares of 11.5%, meaning that SMCI shares have the potential to grow in market value over the next 12 months from $33.20 to $37.00.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SMCI Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main risks to Super Micro's market value growth are still structural issues within the company. Let's break them down into three categories:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The critical concentration of customers in the revenue structure, with approximately 63% of all revenue coming from one major customer. Therefore, anything that changes the customer's CAPEX carries catastrophic risks for SMCI's future orders. Also, there's the potential risk that DELL or HPE could lure the customer away.</li> <li>Marginal business compression, resulting in significantly lower potential net profit growth. To shareholders, net margins of 3.1% mean that SMCI has no safety cushion in the event of market shocks or internal crises. Reasons for this compression of business margins include dumping to compete with DELL and HPE, upscaling of production by Asian competitors, and an increase in SMCI's logistics and procurement costs.</li> <li>A negative operating cash flow of $24 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2026. This is due to a squeeze on business margins, as a result of which the company may face a free cash flow deficit. As of now, the company's cash reserves have reached $10.6 billion, slowing down the turnover of working capital and forcing the company to take out new loans and issue convertible bonds to replenish its working capital. For example, on January 6, 2026, SMCI concluded a new agreement with JPMorgan Chase (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM\" title=\"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.\">JPM</a>) to provide a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4537154-super-micro-computer-enters-2-bln-revolving-credit-facility\">revolving credit line in the amount of $2 billion</a>. As of now, its total debt is $5.263 billion, compared to $1.957 billion a year earlier.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on my fundamental analysis of Super Micro, I would confirm the high investment attractiveness of its shares. Results for 2025 were not easy due to a decline in market share in the global AI server market and margin compression. This is a classic \"growth quality crisis\" situation, in which phenomenal revenue growth is accompanied by a decline in operating efficiency. That said, factors like building a new factory, a 42.9% discount on the EV/Sales multiple, and the Building Block Solutions offering will help the company be more competitive by improving quality instead of dumping prices. To sum up, SMCI represents a unique opportunity to invest in undervalued stocks that will benefit from the transition of data centers to Blackwell chips. My target price of around $37 per share is for the next 6 months and does not take into account the additional benefits of a continued bull market in the AI segment. And if the economic situation turns out to be positive, then I think we could see SMCI return to its 2025 high of $62.36, or even higher.</p>",

The deal will almost entirely be paid for in cash, except for a $5 million stock payment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based in Atlanta, Royston has five manufacturing sites across the country that provide custom store fixtures, signage, and both refrigerated and heated case displays. The company is fully integrated, offering solutions that range from design to engineering, fabrication, distribution, and installation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Typical end market applications involve refueling/C-stores, grocery stores, and quick-service restaurants. On a trailing basis, that is, until September of last year, Royston generated $272 million in sales and $38 million in EBITDA. That works down to a 1.2 times sales multiple and an 8.5 times EBITDA multiple, respectively. That latter multiple drops to 8.1 times if and once tax synergies are considered. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the company sees strong potential for shared manufacturing and cross-selling, such benefits are not quantified. Based on the pro forma numbers (again for the period ending in September), pro forma sales are seen at $864 million, with EBITDA seen around $95 million.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Leading Lighting &amp; Display Solutions</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The paragraph header, in essence, describes the business <a href=\"https://s24.q4cdn.com/769247122/files/doc_presentations/2026/Jan/23/LYTS-Investor-Presentation-Fast-Forward-January-2026.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://s24.q4cdn.com/769247122/files/doc_presentations/2026/Jan/23/LYTS-Investor-Presentation-Fast-Forward-January-2026.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">activities</a> of LSI to the extent not known, as the acquisition of Royston fits perfectly within that. The company is a vertically integrated commercial indoor/outdoor lighting and display solutions company. The company over time has been focusing on higher-value solutions, driven by internal advancements and certain M&amp;A activities over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lighting solutions focus on various indoor, outdoor, and control settings, including high-bays, linear, decorative, canopy, floors, bollards, Bluetooth, dimmers, motion detection, etc. These are used in automotive stores, c-stores, quick-service restaurants, retail and grocery outlets, parking, and sports venues. Other solutions include display solutions, which include menus, for instance, all accompanied by various services offered. Besides offering lighting, such solutions are key for branding and marketing, as well as providing a sense of security, among others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company operates nearly 20 manufacturing sites across the country, serving big names like Walmart, Starbucks, Burger King, Chevron, BP, 7-Eleven, and many more, just to name a few.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company posted sales in the low $300 million in the second half of the 2010s. Some organic improvements and M&amp;A made that share nearly double over the past five years to $600 million. The dealmaking efforts include a 2021 purchase of JSI Store, adding $72 million in sales. This was followed by the 2024 purchase of EMI Technologies to add $87 million in sales, while the company announced a $25 million sales contribution from its fiscal 2026 purchase of Canada's Best Holdings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this was accompanied by operating margins moving up from the mid single-digits to the high single-digits, although they have come down a point or two in recent years. These improvements, both organic and inorganic, made it so that shares rose from the low single digits pre-pandemic to levels in the low twenties. Truth be told, shares traded at these levels pre the Great Financial Crisis.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Game</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last summer, LSI <a href=\"https://s24.q4cdn.com/769247122/files/doc_news/2025/Aug/21/LYTS-PR-4th-Quarter-FY-2025-8-20-25-Final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://s24.q4cdn.com/769247122/files/doc_news/2025/Aug/21/LYTS-PR-4th-Quarter-FY-2025-8-20-25-Final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> its 2025 results, with revenues reported up 22% to $573 million. Adjusted EBITDA was reported at $55 million, for margins of 9.6%. These margins are actually down 140 basis points on the year before. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">GAAP earnings fell four cents to $0.79 per share, with adjusted earnings reported dead flat at $1.07 per share. Excluding about $0.13 per share in stock-based compensation expense, realistic earnings are seen around $0.95 per share. Leverage ratios were reported just shy of 1x, and while the company did not provide formal 2026 guidance, it entered the year with a healthy backlog and strong production outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was driven by a strong end to the year, with organic sales reported up 11% in the final quarter, with margins reported as relatively strong as well. Extrapolating these results, realistic earnings power trended closer to $1.25 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we look at the reported pro forma numbers, sales are seen up to $864 million, with EBITDA seen around $95 million. As of the second quarter of this year, the company operated with about 32 million shares outstanding, with net debt <a href=\"https://investors.lsicorp.com/news/news-details/2026/LSI-Industries-Reports-Fiscal-2026-Second-Quarter-Results-and-Declares-Quarterly-Cash-Dividend/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.lsicorp.com/news/news-details/2026/LSI-Industries-Reports-Fiscal-2026-Second-Quarter-Results-and-Declares-Quarterly-Cash-Dividend/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> at $22 million. Based on the purchase price and the news that a $90 million stock <a href=\"https://investors.lsicorp.com/news/news-details/2026/LSI-Industries-Announces-Proposed-90-Million-Public-Offering-of-Common-Stock/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.lsicorp.com/news/news-details/2026/LSI-Industries-Announces-Proposed-90-Million-Public-Offering-of-Common-Stock/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">issuance</a> is announced in connection with the Royston deal, we can construct some pro forma implications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trading around $22 per share, the equity issuance involves about 4 million shares to be issued, pushing up the pro forma share count to about 36 million. Net debt of $22 million will jump to just over $300 million, for a leverage ratio in the low 3s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Actual depreciation expenses of the business trend at just $6-$7 million, and even if I use a $10 million number for the combination, pro forma EBIT is seen around $85 million. Factoring in a 6% cost of debt on just over $300 million in net debt and applying statutory tax rates, net earnings potential is seen around $50 million, close to $1.40 per share, which looks to be quite accretive. That, however, is ahead of stock-based compensation, all of which could impact earnings by around $0.15 per share here.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Now?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ahead of the Royston deal, LSI commanded an enterprise valuation in the low $700 million at $22 per share, valuing the business at just over 1 times sales, but around 12-13 times trailing EBITDA of $57 million. With largely a similar sales multiple applied to Royston, the big benefit is that it acquired 14% EBITDA margin activities, while its own business posts margins just shy of 10%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This makes for real earnings accretion but comes at the expense of some leverage taken on here. This is noteworthy after second quarter sales of the organic business at $147 million were mostly flat compared to last year, as some organic growth and/or execution seem lacking here in recent times.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So in between the situation ahead and after the deal, the company will likely see roughly 20 cents in earnings accretion from buying a higher-margin business at similar sales multiples, but it jacks up leverage as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One thing is certain: The deal helps in achieving 2028 targets, described under the Fast Forward plan. Under this, the company targets $800 million in sales and 12.5% EBITDA margins, for EBITDA around a hundred million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I furthermore like the fact that Royston provides a one-stop solution and that no synergetic estimates are considered to justify the deal, which takes place at very reasonable multiples. This makes both the financial and strategic considerations behind the deal very sound.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All of this makes me genuinely interested in the business, although I recognize its period of sluggish operating performance in the past. Potential dips in the share price action in response to this deal will be used as a potential buying opportunity. I really like the deal but still feel a bit uneasy given the debt employed and softer recent organic performance.</p>",

CSHI generates a high dividend yield for its investors, which conforms to the elevated benchmark interest rate environment in recent years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund distributed $2.50 per share over the last 12-month period, which indicates a 5% dividend yield. The fund also provides the highest dividend yield among the ultra-short-term ETFs, where iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SGOV\" title=\"iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF\">SGOV</a>) and State Street SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIL\" title=\"State Street SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF\">BIL</a>) generate 4% yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, the option strategy is delivering prominent benefits, which makes CSHI an attractive position compared to other ETFs. The option strategy is designed to enhance the return that the fund earns from T-bills by trading put credit spreads (or bull put spreads). The strategy generates positive returns in rising and flat equity markets and may generate a positive return in equity markets that are modestly declining, assuming the net premium collected from the options sold and purchased exceeds the net cost to close the positions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the fund’s portfolio, the total assets amount to $928 million, with 99% of it allocated to treasury bills. The fund also holds eight option positions with maturity on 03/05/2026 with strike prices ranging between 5875 and 6250 for the long put options and 6150 to 6425 for the short put options.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179278356473_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"945\" data-height=\"502\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179278356473_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Portfolio holdings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179278356473_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179278356473_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179278356473_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179278356473_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Portfolio holdings <span>(fund manager)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that the S&amp;P 500 value is around 6890 points, the options are well out of the money. Note that the bull put spread builds upon a bullish narrative by initiating a short put option on a higher strike to maximize the received premium and a long put option on a lower strike to protect from adverse movement in the S&amp;P 500 index. Hence, the maximum profit of the strategy is the net premium received, achieved when options expire OTM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking into the above table, we can notice that the fund received $16.36 per unit in the contract (paid $11.04 and received $27.40). This brings the total net premium proceeds to $553k, given that there are 338 contracts for each position and 100 units per contract. Compared to the total AUM of close to $1 billion, it doesn’t seem like a big gain from the option strategy, but keep in mind that the option contracts are with a weekly expiration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, the main part of the dividend distribution is generated through the T-bills portfolio. So forecasting the future return requires an assumption about the level and the dynamics of the benchmark dollar interest rate over the investment horizon. During the January meeting, the Federal Reserve kept its interest rate unchanged for the first time since September of last year, or in the range of 3.50%-3.75%. The central bank officials seem hesitant to rush with further rate cuts. However, the futures suggest that the main scenario remains further rate cuts. In particular, CME futures currently imply a rate cut of approximately 50 basis points from the current level down to 3.00-3.25% over the next 12-month horizon. However, it should be noted that the change in the Fed chair has increased the uncertainty surrounding the rate outlook. The <a href=\"https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2026-2-24-the-warsh-shock-nomination-of-kevin-warsh-as-fed-chair-signals-aggressive-balance-sheet-pivot-and-2026-rate-normalization\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://markets.financialcontent.com/stocks/article/marketminute-2026-2-24-the-warsh-shock-nomination-of-kevin-warsh-as-fed-chair-signals-aggressive-balance-sheet-pivot-and-2026-rate-normalization\" target=\"_blank\">nomination</a> of Kevin Warsh marks a definitive end to the \"Powell Era\" and ushers in a new doctrine of monetary discipline characterized by an aggressive reduction of the central bank's multi-trillion-dollar balance sheet. This creates additional macroeconomic uncertainty, where the quantitative tightening would be combined with interest rate cuts.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179600802166_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"945\" data-height=\"410\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179600802166_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Target rate probabilities for March 2027\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"278\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179600802166_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179600802166_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179600802166_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51784773-17720179600802166_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Target rate probabilities for March 2027 <span>(cmegroup)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's assume that the fund generates a 3.5% return over the next 12 months. Given inflation expectations, such an investment should generate a positive real return. Let's note another important point. CSHI returns are driven predominantly by interest rates and are virtually independent of their movements. The average duration of the securities in its portfolio is close to zero due to the ultra-short T-bills. This essentially excludes interest rate risk, meaning the fund provides an excellent hedge against market volatility.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk factors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund gives exposure to T-bills, which are deemed to be reasonably safe assets. However, due to the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and in case of a recession, the US central bank could resort to sharper interest rate cuts, which could decrease the investment return of the fund’s investors. In addition, the negative macro development and bearish sentiment could disrupt the fund’s option strategy, which is not effective during stock market downturns.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taking the current market expectation regarding the interest rates over the next 12-month horizon, the average rate is still around 3.50%. In addition, the fund could generate good profits from the option strategy. However, it’s hard to make any assumptions regarding the strategy return, but if we annualize the current net premium income, the option overlay could deliver up to a 2.86% return. As a result, I will initiate a Buy recommendation on CSHI, which has the potential to deliver up to a 5% return over the next one-year investment horizon. I find the NEOS Enhanced Income 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF as an attractive investment opportunity, as the fund provides virtually risk-free returns to its holders generated from investing in a portfolio of ultra-short T-bills and enhanced by a low-risk profile put option strategy. As a result, CHSI provides a good opportunity to earn up to a 5% return and hedge market volatility caused by macro and geopolitical uncertainty, an unclear monetary policy path, and record tech valuation. In addition, the fund could be a valuable tool for income investors trying to hedge the purchase of long-term bonds, which are the main beneficiaries of monetary policy normalization, by opening a position in securities with low interest rate risk.</p>",

It is interesting to note that robust investors took advantage of the decline in gold prices to bet on extremely high price levels. This occurs as China increases its physical gold stocks to unimaginable levels.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on this analysis, I reiterate the recommendation to buy assets that track the main hard assets, especially gold, as explained in this article.

On a reported basis, sales were down by 40 basis points. This was mainly due to negative FX. The group's EBIT margin, excluding the energy impact, rose by 80 basis points to 20.7%. There was an EBIT acceleration in H2 compared to H1 results. There is evidence of operating leverage, given that on a comparable basis, operating profit growth exceeded sales growth (+7.6% vs. +2%). These results are due to 1) IM pricing that was up by 3.2% in Q4 and translates to ~1.5% yearly sales at the group level, 2) acquisition, and 3) efficiencies. Related to the latest position, the company achieved €631 million in savings, exceeding the €400 million annual target. Looking at the P&amp;L results, Air Liquide's net profit increased by 6.4% and by 9.7% (excluding the negative FX impact).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720090201524806_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"669\" data-height=\"371\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720090201524806_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\" Air Liquide 2025 results\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720090201524806_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720090201524806_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720090201524806_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720090201524806_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span> Air Liquide 2025 results</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.airliquide.com/sites/airliquide.com/files/2026-02/air-liquide-pr-fy-2025-with-record-performance-and-confident-in-its-transformation-dynamic-air-liquide-confirms-its-growth-outlook.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Air Liquide Q4 results press release</a>—Fig. 2</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why are we positive?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Starting with the noteworthy update, the company maintained its 2026 outlook for a 100-basis-point increase in margins.

This was due to higher profits and lower working capital requirements. The company is also on track with its ADVANCE strategic plan, and management has proposed a DPS of €3.70 (Fig. 4), up 12% year over year. There is limited use of the buyback, so a DPS acceleration is a key positive on the company's equity story. More importantly, as reported in our industry analysis, Air Products is moving forward with <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4682433-air-products-and-chemicals-first-mover-advantage-not-priced-in\">first-mover</a> projects in the hydrogen economy (with heavy CAPEX investment), Linde has EPS boosted by heavy buybacks, and Air Liquide represents a solid industrial execution, with EPS evolution backed by that. Still related to the upside, we report that Air Liquide's net debt decreased by €600 million from the 2024 year-end level. At the same time, the company <a href=\"https://www.airliquide.com/group/press-releases-news/2026-02-25/air-liquide-has-successfully-issued-chf-640-million-multi-tranche-bond\" rel=\"nofollow\">issued</a> a CHF bond with limited interest expense, which supports the P&amp;L and the implied company valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720089979421608_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"944\" data-height=\"448\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720089979421608_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\" Air Liquide DPS evolution\" width=\"640\" height=\"304\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720089979421608_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720089979421608_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720089979421608_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720089979421608_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span> Air Liquide DPS evolution</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fig. 4</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at Q4 Large Industries sales, the Healthcare division was up 5%, and Electronics was up 4% (Fig. 5).

Looking at the 2026 management outlook, two of the three updates are met (i.e., points 2 and 3). Going to the sales evolution estimates, we are lowering the Air Liquide turnover projection to €28 billion. We include in our analysis: FX drag of 2.5% and DIG Gases' latest acquisition. The South Korean company <a href=\"https://www.chemicalprocessing.com/industrynews/news/55311795/air-liquide-acquires-dig-airgas-for-31b?utm\" rel=\"nofollow\">generated</a> €510 million in sales in 2024. Given the core operating profit outlook with a +100 basis points increase in 2026 (Fig. 3), we maintained an EBIT margin of 22% and arrived at €6.16 billion. Lowering interest expenses (€200 million) and with no change to the corporate tax rate (25%), our profits are set at €4.7 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the limited buyback, we used the <a href=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=AI:PAR\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">current share numbers</a>; our EPS is €8.1. With no change to our 25x P/E target, which is below peers', we increase our target price from €195 to €202 per share ($47.2 in ADR—this is calculated based on the fact that one ADR is equal to 1/5 of a Paris share). For US investors, AIQUF is typically a less-liquid foreign ordinary share OTC quote, not the main ADR, so we <a href=\"https://stockanalysis.com/quote/otc/AIQUY/?utm\" rel=\"nofollow\">suggest</a> investing in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AIQUY\" title=\"L'Air Liquide S.A.\">AIQUY</a>. For EU investors, Air Liquide’s primary listing trades on Euronext Paris, with an <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AI-FR?utm\" rel=\"nofollow\">average</a> daily volume of ~600k. Our valuation <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AIQUY/valuation/metrics#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">aligns</a> with Air Liquide's 5-year historical average and matches an FWD EV/EBITDA of 15.5x.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We have long covered Air Liquide, so we <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4854250-lair-liquide-solid-q3-execution-and-valuation-upside\">report</a> the following downside risks: FX headwinds, as seen in 2025; execution risks in the company's backlog; and higher CAPEX. Key risks to gas companies include lower global industrial production and regional oversupply. In our previous analysis, we reported that Air Liquide is sensitive to valuation changes due to its high P/E target.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With sales and 2027 margin visibility, a solid backlog, and lower net debt, we remain buyers. We already reported how Air Liquide is an execution growth story, and the company is already ahead of its ADVANCE strategic plan. The latest results confirmed our equity investment story. With a higher price target, Air Liquide offers a 14% potential capital upside and a 2% dividend yield.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Outside of the organic growth, acquisition contribution from the Saela deal helped push overall revenue growth with the acquisition exceeding expectations by contributing roughly $16 million in quarterly revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving down the income statement, gross margins contracted slightly by 30 bps to 51.0% due to an 80 bps headwind from higher fleet costs, but this was partially offset by improvements in insurance claims and material and supplies. SG&amp;A as a percentage of revenue increased by 50 bps as Rollins ramped up some growth initiatives. That combined led to EBITDA coming in at $194 million for the quarter at a 21.2% margin, with FY’25 EBITDA growing 10.8% to $854 million. Altogether, EPS for the quarter was $0.25, which was 2 cents above sell-side estimates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617252129_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1182\" data-height=\"390\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617252129_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Company Filings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"211\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617252129_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617252129_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617252129_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617252129_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Company Filings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With quarterly estimates falling short of expectations due to the erratic weather conditions this winter, the Winter Storm Ferm has created a tough start to the year, with more branch location closures in January 2026 than in January 2025. On the conference call, management noted that on the positive side, while the company continues to see increasing digital lead costs, it does plan to remain within their committed budget.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the balance sheet, Rollins carries minimal leverage that keeps its cost of capital very low. At a net leverage ratio of just 0.9x, well below the company’s target of 2.0x, the company maintains an investment-grade profile with a credit rating of BBB+ by Fitch and a BBB rating by S&amp;P (source: Bloomberg). With the $500 million bond issue below trading at par with a coupon of 5.25%, the company maintains an exceptionally low cost of debt just 134 bps above treasuries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617265462_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"674\" data-height=\"189\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617265462_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bloomberg\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"179\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617265462_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617265462_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617265462_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-1772081617265462_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816172767882_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1167\" data-height=\"201\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816172767882_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Company Filings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"110\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816172767882_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816172767882_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816172767882_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816172767882_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Company Filings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With low leverage, Rollins has ample free cash flow; however, it doesn’t have great reinvestment opportunities to grow organically.

This guidance reflects a pretty solid underlying business, where recurring revenues (excluding ancillary) actually strengthened slightly from Q3 to Q4, which suggests that momentum might carry into the new year despite some short-term weather issues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stable customer retention and low sensitivity to rollbacks both point to healthy consumer demand that hasn't fundamentally shifted. So structurally, I like the industry backdrop a lot. Pest control is driven by population density, urbanization, food safety and health regulation, and rising tolerance for pests approaching zero, which creates a fairly resilient demand pattern through cycles. Rollins sits as the number‑two global player behind Rentokil, with nearly a quarter market share in North America with strong brands that give it pricing power. The fact that over 80% of revenue now comes from recurring and ancillary services (growing north of 7% organically) reinforces my view that this is much closer to a utility‑like annuity stream than a transactional contractor business. As shown below, it’s quite difficult to find a business that has the steady growth financial profile that a company like Rollins has.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178791869_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"957\" data-height=\"719\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178791869_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Investor Presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"481\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178791869_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178791869_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178791869_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178791869_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Investor Presentation </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I view the longer-term story as likely to hinge on a few key levers: continued M&amp;A, operating modernization, and international expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the conference call post-quarter, management signaled a healthy pipeline and underwriting 2–3% annual growth from acquisitions, which seems achievable given how fragmented local pest markets remain. That said, I got the sense from their <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871687-rollins-inc-rol-presents-at-barclays-43rd-annual-industrial-select-conference-transcript\">commentary</a> at the Barclays conference last week that a more sizable deal might be more difficult to come by. For example, when asked whether the recent debt raise was “gearing up” for a transformation acquisition, Rollins talked about “getting better before getting bigger.” So it sounds as if Rollins <em>wants </em>to participate in large deals in the future, but only after internal capabilities are fully upgraded.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With sub-1x leverage, Rollins has the balance sheet to do deals without putting stress on their cap stack. At the same time, they are investing in technology (e.g., with AI‑assisted route optimization, better scheduling, standardized systems, and centralized procurement) to gradually compress unit costs and improve incremental margins, which they’ve pegged in the 25–30% range on forward revenue. If they execute, there’s margin expansion as a meaningful second leg of the equity story, not just a byproduct of scale.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks and Valuation </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I do have some reservations that temper my enthusiasm that sit mainly around valuation and execution risk. As I’ll discuss in this section, this is already a well‑owned “quality compounder” with a premium multiple. In the chart below, we can see that sell-side consensus is looking for low‑teens EPS growth off an earnings base that is not obviously depressed, and the market is effectively assuming that high‑single‑digit organic growth plus steady margin progress is the base case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816177858422_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"864\" data-height=\"480\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816177858422_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bloomberg\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"356\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816177858422_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816177858422_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816177858422_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816177858422_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In that context, disruptions (whether from weather events like in this quarter that hit one‑time work) can create noise in quarterly numbers. At some point, that might start to matter for a richly valued stock. And despite other analysts’ optimism around it, I also think international remains more of a long‑dated option rather than a material growth driver, given that international is still a single‑digit share of revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where I think the risks will come from for investors is on valuation. While Rollins has always been an expensive stock, it’s rarely been this expensive. As illustrated in the graph below, the forward EV/EBITDA valuation (not the share price) has gone up and to the right in the last three years. This was a business that was trading at sub-20x EBITDA all day long during the pandemic, but investors have unjustly bid shares much higher, now at a 10-turn premium to its historical average (source: Bloomberg).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816174100485_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"380\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816174100485_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Bloomberg\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"304\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816174100485_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816174100485_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816174100485_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816174100485_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to being expensive relative to its own historical valuation, Rollins is expensive relative to comparable companies within its industry.

For example, using the company’s P/E ratio, the business is expected to grow its earnings at a low-teens rate. If we assume an even higher figure of 15% over a five-year period, which would roughly double the company’s earnings from 2025 to the end of the decade, Rollins would still trade at a 24x earnings multiple on earnings that are half a decade away. For that reason, I find the stock. Analysts would seem to agree, given that their average target price of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROL/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">$63.66</a> implies just 5.2% upside from today’s levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178417304_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"440\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178417304_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"235\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178417304_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178417304_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178417304_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816178417304_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816173487153_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"846\" data-height=\"260\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816173487153_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"197\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816173487153_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816173487153_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816173487153_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59284136-17720816173487153_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion </strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, Rollins is a business that I’d like to own, but it’s just too expensive today.

This was set against exits and repayments of $218.8 million to continue the ramp seen in the BDC's total investment portfolio.

They're also trading for just 40 cents above their liquidation price of $25 per note. However, these would only be for the most risk-averse investors, and the common shares continue to offer a better upside even with them trading hands at a roughly 14.8% premium to NAV per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/41871776-17720546336478086_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1576\" data-height=\"128\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/41871776-17720546336478086_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trinity Capital Securities\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"52\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/41871776-17720546336478086_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/41871776-17720546336478086_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/41871776-17720546336478086_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/41871776-17720546336478086_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Trinity Capital Fiscal 2025 Form 10-K</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am rating TRIN as a Strong Buy on the back of the full dividend coverage, expanding footprint of investments, and $0.84 per share of undistributed earnings spillover. The SaaSpocalypse panic is exactly what it is, a market phenomenon whose actual real-world effects will take years to play out and in a much less dramatic way.</p>",

Stock selection within IT and Financials contributed positively to performance during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\">SSNLF</a>) (South Korea, IT sector), a consumer and industrial electronic manufacturer, including products such as semiconductors, was the top contributor during the quarter after rising memory prices amid tight supply-demand conditions for memory products supported performance. We anticipate this environment to continue into 2026, with ongoing data center expansion contributing to sustained demand for memory products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nintendo Co. Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTDOY\" title=\"Nintendo Co., Ltd.\">NTDOY</a>) (Japan, Communication Services sector), a videogame hardware and software manufacturer, was the top detractor during the period. We believe shares traded lower following a recent period of strong console launches, with additional downward pressure attributed to concerns over rising memory prices, which may affect margins, and a temporary gap in new title releases. Component supply for the company is expected to be well managed in the near term, and incremental announcements for new games are anticipated to begin as early as February, which we believe will support growth for the business moving into the new year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Fund added a position in Erste Group Bank AG (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EBKDY\" title=\"Erste Group Bank AG\">EBKDY</a>) (Austria, Financials sector), an Austrian and Central Eastern European bank, as we believe the market is underappreciating the company's outsized loan growth, improving profitability prospects, and increasing capital generation potential. The strategy also initiated a position in Rolls-Royce Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RYCEY\" title=\"Rolls-Royce Holdings plc\">RYCEY</a>) (United Kingdom, Industrials sector), one of few engine manufacturers and servicers for the commercial aerospace industry. We believe the company has strong competitive positions in power generation equipment, defense, and small modular nuclear reactors. In our view, the current management team has demonstrated success with improving engine performance on their primary aerospace platforms while the air travel market recovers, leading to higher earnings and cash flow improvement. Further, emerging tailwinds such as robust data center spending, power grid constraints, and increasing defense spending should accelerate growth in their non-aerospace segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Fund exited its position in BNP Paribas S.A. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BNPQY\" title=\"BNP Paribas SA\">BNPQY</a>) (France, Financials sector), a French bank, following a U.S. jury verdict that we believe opens the way for the company to be required to pay compensation demands which we view will be an overhang on stock performance into 2026. The Fund also exited its position in Sony Financial Group Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SFGYY\" title=\"Sony Financial Group Inc.\">SFGYY</a>) (Japan, Financials sector), after the business was spun out into a separate unit away from the consumer products and gaming company. We remain invested in the part of the business that focuses on the consumer discretionary and gaming segments.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <h4>A Word About Risk</h4> <p>The Fund invests in equities which are subject to market volatility and loss. The Fund invests in stocks of large-cap companies which may be unable to respond quickly to new competitive challenges. The Fund invests in stocks of small- and mid-cap companies, which may be subject to more erratic market movements than stocks of larger, more established companies. The Fund invests in preferred stocks which are relegated below bonds for payment should the issuer be liquidated. If interest rates rise, the fixed dividend on preferred stocks may be less attractive, causing their price to decline. The Fund invests in foreign, emerging and frontier markets securities, and depositary receipts, such as American Depositary Receipts, Global Depositary Receipts, and European Depositary Receipts, which carry the associated risks of economic and political instability, market liquidity, currency volatility and accounting standards that differ from those of U.S. markets and may offer less protection to investors. The risks associated with investing in foreign markets are magnified in emerging markets, and in frontier markets due to their smaller and less developed economies. The sub-advisor considers ESG factors that it deems relevant or additive along with other material factors. The ESG criteria may cause the Fund to forgo opportunities to buy certain securities and/or gain exposure to certain industries, sectors, regions and countries. The Fund may be required to sell a security when it could be disadvantageous to do so. Events in the U.S. and global financial markets, including actions taken to stimulate or stabilize economic growth may at times result in unusually high market volatility, which could negatively impact Fund performance and cause it to experience illiquidity, shareholder redemptions, or other potentially adverse effects. Banks and financial services companies could suffer losses if interest rates rise or economic conditions deteriorate. The Advisor engages a sub-advisor to make investment decisions for the Fund's portfolio; it may be unable to identify and retain a sub-advisor who achieves superior investment returns relative to other similar sub-advisors. The Fund invests in convertible securities which are subject to the risks of both debt securities and equity securities. The Fund's investments in other investment companies will be subject to substantially the same risks as those associated with the direct ownership of the securities comprising the portfolios of such investment companies, and the value of the Fund's investment will fluctuate in response to the performance of such portfolios. In addition, if the Fund acquires shares of investment companies, shareholders of the Fund will bear their proportionate share of the fees and expenses of the Fund and, indirectly, the fees and expenses of the investment companies or ETFs. Current and future portfolio holdings are subject to change.</p> </td></tr></table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
