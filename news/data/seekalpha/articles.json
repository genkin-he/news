Moreover, the lower federal funds rate should reduce some of the strain on borrowers with rates indexed to short-term interest rates, while incentivizing people to spend more rather than save, since savings interest rates will also likely fall in tandem. However, the long-term interest rate picture remains much murkier, which challenges the notion that rate cuts are a tailwind for much of the stock market.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this article, we will detail what the latest FOMC meeting means for the market as a whole and share where we are finding attractive opportunities right now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Divided Fed And A Conflicted Economy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In its meeting, the FOMC acknowledged that the jobs market has weakened some this year, citing that:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>job gains have slowed this year and the unemployment rate has edged up but remained low. </em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>inflation has moved up since earlier in the year and remained somewhat elevated.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This indicates that the Fed is facing tensions on both sides of its dual mandate: inflation is far from being beaten back, while the jobs market is increasingly appearing like it may need some support. This makes the decision to end quantitative tightening all the more controversial given that it will effectively enable the monetary supply to remain more stable even in a time when inflation remains elevated and the monetary supply still remains vastly inflated compared to where it was before the huge QE took place around COVID.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0a6bb9cfa77e3f831d164911246a7542.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0a6bb9cfa77e3f831d164911246a7542.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0a6bb9cfa77e3f831d164911246a7542.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0a6bb9cfa77e3f831d164911246a7542.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0a6bb9cfa77e3f831d164911246a7542.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0a6bb9cfa77e3f831d164911246a7542.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0a6bb9cfa77e3f831d164911246a7542.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0a6bb9cfa77e3f831d164911246a7542.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0a6bb9cfa77e3f831d164911246a7542.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The real headline of the day, though, was when Fed Chair Jerome Powell made clear that in December, another rate cut \"is not a foregone conclusion.\" The vote today, coming in at 10-2, including one voting for no cut at all, while the other wanted a more bullish 50-basis-point cut, shows that there was not even unanimous consensus behind the current rate cut. Therefore, the next FOMC vote for a cut could face materially more opposition. Not only that, but market liquidity conditions and market and mid-market spreads had been tightening, which was apparently one of the biggest driving factors for them to end their quantitative tightening practices despite inflation remaining elevated.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Implications For Stocks, Bonds, And Inflation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, what does this mean for the markets? Well, for the S&amp;P 500 (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR® S&amp;P 500® ETF\">SPY</a></span>) and NASDAQ (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust ETF\">QQQ</a></span>) , it means that there is yet another rate cut and the promise of quantitative tightening ending that should, in a vacuum, serve as tailwinds. That being said, given that both major indexes are increasingly being dominated by high-growth stocks that are investing aggressively in AI with uncertain timelines to achieving an attractive return on those investments, they are becoming increasingly interest-rate-sensitive vehicles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the Fed weakening its war on inflation through ending quantitative tightening and cutting short-term interest rates means that long-term interest rates may not actually come down much, especially given that inflation remains elevated and there remains plenty of pressure on the bond market from runaway budget deficits as well as the immense amounts of capital needed to invest in the huge AI buildout and re-industrialization of the U.S. This should mean that demand for bonds will remain under pressure, which means that the market will likely continue to be flooded by both corporate and government bond issuances.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that the market is <a href=\"https://currentmarketvaluation.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">significantly overvalued</a> based on numerous valuation models, a lack of relief on the long end of the curve will likely make the market increasingly focused on valuations, which could cause it to pull back sharply into correction territory due to a lack of rate relief on the long end of the curve. This will also likely serve as a headwind to fixed-income investments (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BND\" title=\"Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund ETF Shares\">BND</a>) because long-duration fixed income might not be getting the tailwind it would need to rally from falling long-term interest rates, while falling short-term interest rates make short-term fixed income and/or floating-rate debt instruments that much less attractive since the yield is declining on them.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sector Rotation: Value Over Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, given the increased interest rate sensitivity of the broader indexes that are increasingly weighted towards growth, I would expect higher-for-longer long-term interest rates to cause at least somewhat of a rotation towards value and dividend stocks, especially if they are ones that are somewhat stagflation-resistant, thereby enabling them to weather a higher inflation rate environment and are not particularly dependent on raising debt regularly from the capital markets. In particular, I like three segments right now:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Gold (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLD\" title=\"SPDR® Gold Shares ETF\">GLD</a>) And Silver (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLV\" title=\"iShares Silver Trust ETF\">SLV</a>) Bullion Leases: I like investing in gold and silver bullion leases because they give me full ownership of the underlying metal while also earning an attractive yield on those investments. This makes it not only an attractive source of passive income but also access to an investment that tends to do quite well when short-term interest rates fall since it makes gold a more attractive relative store of wealth when savings account and CD rates decline. Additionally, in an inflationary environment, gold also tends to do well over the long term, and silver often follows gold.</p></li> <li><p>Midstream Infrastructure (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMLP\" title=\"Alerian MLP ETF\">AMLP</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EPD\" title=\"Enterprise Products Partners L.P. Common Units\">EPD</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ET\" title=\"Energy Transfer LP Common Units\">ET</a>): I really like the midstream infrastructure space right now, as I detailed in a recent <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831472-midstream-now-my-highest-conviction-buy-after-gold-and-silver-big-run\">article</a>. This is because its balance sheets having never been stronger, which makes them resistant to higher-for-longer interest rate environments. Moreover, the inflation indexation in many of its contracts, as well as the fact that energy tends to do well in inflationary environments, positions it well for higher-for-longer inflation and long-term interest rate environments. Additionally, the highly contracted nature of the underlying assets makes it defensive, while the yields are sky-high, positioning the sector to shine even if the market sours on the major indexes due to their rich valuations. </p></li> <li><p>Quality Dividend Stocks: I like quality dividend stocks as seen in index funds and ETFs like the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHD\" title=\"Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF™\">SCHD</a>). Their strong dividend growth, fairly defensive nature, attractive yields, and significant current profits make them attractive alternatives to richly valued speculative longer-term profit propositions that many of the largest companies in the major indexes are faced with right now.</p></li> </ol> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investor Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the Fed's rate cut and end of quantitative tightening normally would be viewed as a tailwind for the market, the uncertain long-term path for rate cuts has thrown a cloud of uncertainty on the markets right now. This is because the Fed has said that inflation remains elevated, and while there are signs of cracks forming in the jobs market, balancing its dual mandate is very important. Therefore, long-term interest rates do not appear headed lower until inflation gets suppressed materially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This means that the recent bull run for the broader market may well be over, and instead, alternative places like precious metals bullion leases and other highly contracted investment-grade and dividend-paying infrastructure stocks and even a broadly diversified basket of high-quality defensive dividend growth stocks in ETFs like SCHD are looking like more attractive risk-adjusted alternatives. These are the types of opportunities, and in particular midstream and bullion leases, that we are loading up on in our portfolios right now at <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1369-high-yield-investor\" rel=\"noopener\">High Yield Investor</a>.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The same happened with silver but in reverse as the Comex came to rescue London. This data is ringing the alarm bells. Physical supplies are stretched and people are waking up to this fact. Both metals have entered a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4832059-technicals-recovering-from-2011-ptsd\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">much needed price correction</a>, but the fundamentals that drove the price spikes are very much at play.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom line, there is not enough physical silver and gold to satisfy global demand. The game of musical chairs has started and it is far from over. The silver squeeze may have been eased for now, but it’s only a matter of time before it resumes again in earnest. One day, there won’t be another vault halfway around the world that can come to the rescue for both gold and silver.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/comex-update-physical-markets-remain-under-pressure\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p>",

That matters because when we assess the relative health of the U.S. new home market, the primary data we employ is the Census Bureau's new residential sales data that tells us both the estimated number of new homes sold each month and the average price at which they sold. We multiply these figures together to produce an estimate of the total value of new homes sold within the U.S. each month. We then calculate the trailing twelve-month average to smooth out seasonal variation in the data, shifting it \"backward\" in time so it becomes more of a contemporary indicator of the trends being experienced by the new home market.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But if that government-compiled data is not available, does that mean we're dead in the water for producing that kind of analysis?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Don't be silly. As with most data the government publishes that's useful, there are alternative sources available from private sector sources that provide a similar window for looking into the state of the new home market. We're going to use one of those alternative sources to do that today, which will give us a different but still useful picture of the.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We've tapped <a href=\"https://www.zillow.com/research/data/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener\">Zillow's monthly data</a> for new construction homes, which covers single-family residences and condominiums, which is based on sales data for this class of real estate from major metropolitan areas in the U.S., to produce a national figure. That's a subset of the data that's compiled in the Census Bureau's new residential sales data but should work to give us an idea of how the market is for the new construction homes in the markets that Zillow covers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And also for which it has sales data. Because Zillow obtains its data from state and local sources that are slower to report their monthly new home sales figures, it lags a bit behind the national and regional estimates of new home sales data reported by the Census Bureau. Zillow provided its first estimate for August 2025 just two weeks ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although Zillow has data extending back to January 2018, it has greatly expanded its coverage in recent years, which makes its older data less directly comparable to its more recent data. For our analysis, we'll focus on the period from January 2024 through August 2025 because this data is most similar in its scope of coverage to the data for August 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From here, we'll treat Zillow's data for new construction sales for single-family residences and condominiums just like the Census Bureau's new residential sales data for our analysis. The following charts present the U.S. new home <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_total-valuation-of-new-construction-202401-202508.png\" rel=\"noopener\">market capitalization</a>, the <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_number-of-new-construction-sales-202401-202508.png\" rel=\"noopener\">number of new construction sales</a>, and their <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_mean-sale-price-of-new-construction-202401-202508.png\" rel=\"noopener\">average sale prices</a> as measured by their time-shifted, trailing twelve-month averages from January 2024 through August 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_total-valuation-of-new-construction-202401-202508.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trailing Twelve Month Average New Home Sales Market Capitalization in the United States, January 2024 -

36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Starting with the chart showing the total valuation of new construction from January 2024 through August 2025, we'll start by noting August 2025's total valuation of $22.26 billion from Zillow's new construction is about 73% of our <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4825812-august-2025-new-home-sales-jump-possible-statistical-fluke\" rel=\"noopener\">initial estimate of $30.53 billion</a> for the total value of all new homes sold based on the U.S. Census Bureau's data in August 2025. That's large enough for Zillow's data to provide a good indication of the overall state of the U.S. new home market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The trend data, indicated by the time-shifted trailing twelve-month average (orange) in the chart, shows the new home market was largely flat from January 2024 through August 2024 but has been slowly falling off in the year since.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That mirrors similar trends for the number of new construction sales over the same period of time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The trend for the mean sale price of new construction shows a different pattern. Here, average sale prices rose from May 2024 through December 2024 but have fallen off in the months since. First slowly from December 2024 through May 2025, then more steeply.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That pattern indicates 2025 has been a difficult market for the builders of single-family homes and condominiums. Although they've been lowering prices since the end of 2024, it hasn't been enough to reverse the downtrend in the number of sales. A good portion of that problem has been tied up with elevated mortgage rates, which have made new homes less affordable than they would otherwise be had these interest rates been lower. The problem of unaffordability is harming the market for new homes. And by extension, Americans seeking to become new homeowners.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The analysis that falls out from using Zillow's data on new construction homes largely squares with the analysis we've been doing for years with the Census Bureau's new home sales figures. The government shutdown isn't an obstacle for reading the state of the U.S. new home market.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">References</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zillow.

This is a problem for an Income Investor.</p> <p>NEOS Gold High Income ETF (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IAUI\" title=\"NEOS Gold High Income ETF\">IAUI</a></span>) tries to solve this problem and transforms gold into a cash-generating instrument with<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> an options strategy. And it is interesting because it still follows the trend of gold which is an asset uncorrelated with other income assets such as bonds, securitizations and dividend-oriented stocks or Reits. This benefit costs in terms of a cap on the upside. I therefore wonder, will this weight have a strong impact on future performance? To tell the truth it might not be so impactful in my opinion, but allow me to explain better.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The characteristics to know</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund was created with the goal of generating high monthly income with <a href=\"https://neosfunds.com/iaui/\" rel=\"nofollow\">potential appreciation linked to the performance of gold</a> through active management (run by Garrett Paolella and Troy Cates). In return, the fund offers an expense ratio of 0.78%, not negligible at all and higher than other traditional investment solutions such as GLD and IAU. To this is added an equally significant bid/ask spread of 0.21%, which makes entering (and exiting) the fund quite expensive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"942\" data-height=\"245\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IAUI - expense grade\" width=\"640\" height=\"166\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617325709111636_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IAUI - expense grade <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But as my kind colleagues from the financial advising section always remind me, if you look at the price you lose the quality (even if I think it’s a good slogan for sales, in the markets it’s not exactly always the case).

The sale of calls transforms part of gold’s potential upside into a monthly coupon flow. IAUI in fact has a distribution rate of 12.63% and a 30-day SEC yield of 2.13%. The distributed yield (12.63%) does not represent actual income but is largely a return of capital (90%). It does this to reduce the investor’s average tax cost, defer taxation, and maintain RIC status. This means that the final performance will depend heavily on the level of implied volatility on gold: the higher it is, the richer the premiums; the lower it is, the lower the returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike GLD/IAU, which instead will not always have a return positively correlated to volatility. In fact, in most cases there is an inverse correlation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1554\" data-height=\"509\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IAUI - GLD - IAU: total return\" width=\"640\" height=\"210\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761732930317145_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IAUI - GLD - IAU: total return <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Allow me to explain why.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I expect</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To answer, I switch for a moment from IAUI to the options market on GLD.

At the same time, if the IV were reduced, the size of the premium collected would also contract, therefore the distribution.</p></li> <li><p>If the underlying collapses, IAUI would record the contraction on the price without limitations, as much as IAU. What would, however, (significantly) mitigate the fall would be the distribution, because presumably the volatility of the underlying would increase, and the covered call strategy would probably collect higher premiums.</p></li> </ol> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are some evident cons. IAUI is very expensive, and it presents a clear and transparent cap on the upside, on one of the most bought assets of the last years. At the same time, what is happening on the options market stimulates my appetite for this instrument: potentially, the explosion of volatility would accentuate the premiums collected by the management, which would imply competitive distributions. If at the same time, this generated a contraction in the exponential growth rate of the underlying, IAUI would become more competitive compared to the last quarter. An income investor could find in IAUI a cash flow alternative decorrelated from the classic coupon solutions (bond and securitizations) or equity (dividends and REITs), with a total return similar to that of gold.</p>",

When German Chancellor Friedrich Merz took office in May, he promised that all Germans would feel change and improvement by the summer. This morning’s first estimate of<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> German third-quarter GDP shows that this promise has not been fulfilled. In fact, the German economy just narrowly avoided a technical recession, as it stagnated in the third quarter, following a slightly upwardly revised contraction of -0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter (was -0.3% QoQ). On the year, the economy grew by 0.3%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">GDP details will only be released at the end of November, but available monthly data, as well as the statistical office’s press release, suggest that investments were a small growth driver, while exports and private consumption weighed on economic activity.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2025 is yet another year of stagnation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With today's GDP data and assuming no future revisions, the German economy is clearly headed towards another year of de facto stagnation. In fact, another quarter of stagnation would bring annual growth in 2025 to some 0.2%, keeping the size of the economy still below its late-2019 level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the excitement and enthusiasm sparked by Germany’s fiscal policy U-turn and its decision to invest significantly in infrastructure and defence this spring, the summer brought a rude awakening. The mood in Germany soured and optimism ground to a halt – and not just because of US tariffs or a stronger euro, both of which complicate matters for the export industry. In fact, German policymakers are apparently just now waking up to the painful reality that readers of our research have heard endlessly over the last five years. A reality in which Germany has lost international competitiveness as a result of long-term underinvestment, a portion of naivety and arrogance, and China's rise from export destination to system rival. Current fears of production stops in the German (automotive) industry as a result of Chinese export controls on microchips are one of too many reminders that German industry is no longer dictating the rules of the game and, instead, merely lies at the receiving end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another reason for the worsening mood in Germany is domestic politics. The hope that a new government and fiscal stimulus would finally lift the economy out of its prolonged stagnation seems to have faded. Why? The discussion around possible austerity measures undermines the psychological impact of the announced fiscal stimulus. The government’s decision to shift previously planned investments from the annual budget to special investment funds has also brought a whiff of creative accounting in German fiscal policy. These developments not only revive unpleasant memories of coalition infighting from the previous government but also risk dampening household and corporate spending and investment decisions.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">All hopes are still on fiscal stimulus</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s be clear: the scale of Germany’s announced fiscal stimulus – €500bn for infrastructure and a 'whatever it takes' stance on defence – remains significant. This money will eventually reach the economy. However, recent fiscal manoeuvres have increased the risk that the stimulus will be less impactful and slower to materialise than initially hoped. Add to this the well-known supply-side constraints, from a shortage of skilled labour and high material costs to bureaucratic hurdles, and it seems likely that infrastructure investments will boost the economy more in 2027 than in 2026. Defence spending, on the other hand, could still deliver a positive growth surprise. Beyond the diluted impact of fiscal stimulus, the government is still struggling to agree on the far-reaching reforms needed to structurally enhance Germany’s competitiveness. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has promised a 'Fall of Reforms.' So far, the government has not only failed to deliver but also appears stuck in a macroeconomic model rooted in the 20th century, lacking a clear plan to propel the German economy into the 21st century.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, autumn isn’t over yet, and recent weeks have seen new initiatives aimed at reducing bureaucracy and boosting digitalisation. And yes, it takes time for investments and reforms to translate into growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Europe's growth laggard</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, while other eurozone countries showed surprisingly strong growth, the German economy continues to lag behind. The country remains stuck in stagnation and only banking on fiscal stimulus to come to the rescue gets increasingly risky. The longer this stagnation lasts, the easier it is to surprise to the upside. However, to return as a real powerhouse, Germany quickly needs a coherent, longer-term strategy and less wishful thinking with full pockets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

The fund is<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> recent and started trading in December 2024 with the goal of investing in companies that saw buy orders from \"knowledgeable insiders\". The fund is actively managed and now holds 188 companies from all over the world.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The idea behind the strategy is that if insiders are buying shares of the company, it is because they know best about their companies, and tracking their transactions is a smart way to invest: we will get back to that because this is true, but with some additional precautions to take, that the fund is not taking.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will rate COPY a hold, because academic research highlights that some key features need to be validated for such a strategy to work, and COPY is only partially fitting them.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Academic Case for Following Insiders</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As COPY lacks a proper track record, the analysis will hinge on two research papers highlighting the rationale behind the \"insider trading strategy.” This is a well researched topic, and the relevance of the buy signals given by the insiders has been properly analyzed already.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The first research paper I will refer to is the “Are CEOs’ purchases more profitable than they appear?” paper by Christopher Armstrong, Terrence Blackburne, and Phillip Quinn, published in November 2020 and accessible <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016541012030080X?via%3Dihub\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. This paper is interesting as it highlights that the primary goal of CEOs when they invest in the stocks of their companies is not to get excess returns. In reality, they do get some excess returns with them, but only 3%. Of course, beating the market by 3% is already an appealing thing, but the reality is that the true source of profit for them can be found elsewhere. The act of buying shares is a signal aimed at the board for the CEO, often when the stocks are performing badly (note that this is very relevant here because COPY’s management also seeks to buy “companies that we believe are undervalued”), to gain their confidence. In reality, this is less about the long-term convictions of the company and more about securing the CEO position and additional compensation for several years, and this paper proves that in reality, over the long term, CEOs get an effective return of 58% thanks to the advantages they get from their take in the company (compensation + longer tenure).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This leads us to want to ask why a CEO is buying shares of their company, and how to identify when stocks are being bought for a good reason. The second research paper I identified precisely answers this question. The paper is called “CEO ownership, stock market performance, and managerial discretion,” published by Ulf von Lilienfeld-Toal and Stefan Ruenzi in The Journal of Finance, accessible <a href=\"https://www.hhs.se/contentassets/7adb009f30e54518837ea48df0efd6a3/ceo-ownership.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. This paper shows a significant and robust statistical correlation between the level of excess returns of stocks being bought by CEOs and two factors easy to track: the level of CEO ownership and the degree of managerial discretion. Basically, if the CEO owns 10% or more of the company and has a high degree of liberty in his actions, you can expect excess returns (defined by a Fama-French-Carhart 4-factor model using “market portfolio, a small minus large portfolio, a high minus low book-to-market portfolio, and a momentum based portfolio” as parameters) of between 3.5% and 6.2% excess returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the following part, I will take a look at the fund’s key holdings to determine if the fund’s active management is following these results, as they are significant and robust, or if they don’t.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Testing COPY Against the Research</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The following table is a summary of the top 10 holdings of the fund, where I will look at the level of CEO ownership and managerial discretion level to assess if the key holdings (which we will assess to be representative of the rest of the portfolio), have the potential for alpha generation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CEO ownership is sourced from the website <a href=\"https://simplywall.st/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Free Portfolio Tracker, Stock Insights, and Community - Simply Wall St</a> unless indicated otherwise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Managerial discretion is estimated from my view on the activity.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p><strong>Equity</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Weight</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>CEO Ownership</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Managerial Discretion</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Alpha Potential According to Academic Research</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Deposit Account</p></td> <td><p>1.59%</p></td> <td><p>N/A</p></td> <td><p>N/A</p></td> <td><p>N/A</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>DPM Metals Inc</p></td> <td><p>1.42%</p></td> <td><p>0.1%</p></td> <td><p>High (Mining operations)</p></td> <td><p>Low</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>BAWAG Group AG</p></td> <td><p>1.33%</p></td> <td><p><a href=\"https://www.bawaggroup.com/en/investor-relations/share-information/shareholder-structure\" rel=\"nofollow\">1.6%</a></p></td> <td><p>High (Banking sector)</p></td> <td><p>Low-Medium - Below 10% but noticeable</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Erste Group Bank AG</p></td> <td><p>1.22%</p></td> <td><p>Low</p></td> <td><p>High (Banking operations)</p></td> <td><p>Low</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>StoneX Group Inc</p></td> <td><p>1.16%</p></td> <td><p>0.6%</p></td> <td><p>High (Capital markets)</p></td> <td><p>Low</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>HCI Group Inc</p></td> <td><p>1.13%</p></td> <td><p>8.1%</p></td> <td><p>Very High (Insurance) &amp; Founder-CEO</p></td> <td><p>High - Near 10%, founder-CEO</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Burberry Group PLC</p></td> <td><p>1.12%</p></td> <td><p>0.01%</p></td> <td><p>High (Luxury strategy)</p></td> <td><p>Low</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Resideo Technologies Inc</p></td> <td><p>1.09%</p></td> <td><p>0.3%</p></td> <td><p>High (Tech products)</p></td> <td><p>Low</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Banco Santander SA</p></td> <td><p>1.08%</p></td> <td><p>0.02%</p></td> <td><p>Medium (Large bank, regulated)</p></td> <td><p>Low</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>General Motors Co</p></td> <td><p>0.96%</p></td> <td><p>0.05%</p></td> <td><p>Medium (Large, regulated)</p></td> <td><p>Low</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the top 10 holdings, there is only one company that is close to fitting the definition of a good insider company: HCI Group Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HCI\" title=\"HCI Group, Inc.\">HCI</a>), presenting characteristics highlighted in the research paper #2. Paresh Patel is the CEO and founder of the company and has an 8.1% stake in the company. This is not the 10% threshold identified by the research paper but is really close, and because of his status as a founder, he has a very significant degree of managerial discretion within his company. Rather than buying COPY, if you like the investment philosophy of the fund, I would rather advise you to buy shares of HCI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the other holdings, the degree of ownership of the CEO is simply too low to be even considered. I will give an honorable mention to BAWAG Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BWAGF\" title=\"BAWAG Group AG\">OTCPK:BWAGF</a>) as it beats the 1% mark, but remains 5x too small. Of course, with large cap companies, it can be rare to find features such as the one highlighted in the paper, but as the fund’s scope is global, it is still very possible to find companies that fit the criteria.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With regard to academic research, the strategy of COPY is not as good as it could be. Of course, other definitions of \"insider activity\" can be found, and COPY claims to be using an opaque proprietary model that we won’t be able to analyze, so we are only left with the methodology I applied above. Maybe time will tell that we can trust the fund’s proprietary model, but for now, the only thing relevant to assess is if the strategy with regard to what we know works, and this doesn’t give me any optimistic views on the fund.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Structure, Risks, and Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund is new, and looking at the track record is not going to be very interesting. For now, the fund delivered returns above the MSCI World, as you can see from the screenshot below, but looking at the difference between 1M, QTD, and YTD returns also suggests a high volatility and an above-market risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/62027828-17617575152050736_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1222\" data-height=\"390\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/62027828-17617575152050736_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"COPY's performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"204\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/62027828-17617575152050736_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/62027828-17617575152050736_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/62027828-17617575152050736_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/62027828-17617575152050736_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/62027828-17617575152050736_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/62027828-17617575152050736_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/62027828-17617575152050736_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/62027828-17617575152050736_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">COPY's performance <span>(Tweedy, Browne Company LLC)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In any case, the goal of the fund is long term capital appreciation, so short-term returns are not a good indicator.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund’s expense ratio is 0.80%, which puts the fund on the more expensive side of active funds, but this could also be explained by the global mandate of the fund. While new, with an inception date of December 2024, the fund already has AUM of $169.1 million, enough to provide investors with a median bid/ask spread of 0.08%. Of course, this is not enough to be fully comfortable, and you will have to monitor the spread before making a transaction, but considering the young nature of the fund, this might be something that will change.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we think about risks, the main one of the fund is strategic. Everything relies on the success of Tweedy Browne's proprietary multi-factor model, and while we wait for a track record, we can only observe that the portfolio is not following the academic research. I worry that the fund is focusing on weaker insider signals rather than proven ones.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, the Tweedy Browne Insider + Value ETF is a hold. I have not found anything that convinces me to consider investing in the fund, and the idea that insiders know best, as highlighted in the research paper #1, only provides investors with a limited upside, which might be an opportunity cost.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the mid- to long-term horizon, if the management proves that their different approach actually translates to excess returns, my rating could evolve to a buy, but for now, while the approach is interesting, I don’t see COPY as a way to capture insider-driven alpha.</p>",

The details are solid. Domestic demand improved thanks to<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a rebound in investment, particularly from businesses. Household consumption stayed positive (+0.1%), and government spending increased by 0.5%. Overall, final domestic demand contributed +0.3 percentage points to growth.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">External trade delivered an exceptional boost (+0.9ppt); exports surged by 2.2%, while imports edged lower. Inventories, however, dragged growth down by -0.6ppt, reversing previous trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Production strengthened across most industrial sectors and services. Carry-over growth for this year now stands at 0.8%, making the government’s 0.7% target for the year highly achievable.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Uncertain outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The outlook for the future is rather uncertain. Political and budgetary uncertainty is likely to weigh on growth momentum. Still, improving business sentiment and consumer confidence in October suggest the impact could be smaller or delayed. INSEE data shows that household consumption rose 0.3% in September, despite intense political headlines. So far, macroeconomic fallout from the crisis looks limited.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, several warning signs persist. Global demand is slowing. Household savings intentions have hit record highs, making a drop in the savings rate unlikely. Business confidence gains are concentrated in a few sectors, notably aerospace. And with budget talks dragging on in parliament, there’s no clarity on next year’s tax treatment for firms and households.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These factors point to a slowdown in the fourth quarter and a weak start to 2026. Forecast uncertainty is unusually high, but for now, we expect GDP growth of 0.8% in 2025 and 0.9% in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

The real problem we have to discuss here is how safe the bonds are. The company has been a terrible investment, but it has still delivered a positive return, and it can sustain its capital structure. The bonds might be mistreated based on the company's common stock performance, even though the performance itself is not the main criterion for determining the company's credibility. We need to examine the safety of the bonds, and as usual, we will be guided by the methodology Moody's uses to assess the credit score for BDCs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Strengths And Weaknesses</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As mentioned earlier, the company operates with a leverage of around 41.46%. This provides it with a buffer in its asset coverage ratio cushion of around 60.8%, and its total asset coverage ratio is around 241%. This is one of the best results in the sector. Over the past three years, the company has achieved a return on assets of around 1.8%. Around 2.76% of its loan portfolio is in the \"non-accrual\" category. Around 59% of its assets are secured by senior assets, while there is no secured debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we use the Moody's approach, the ratings of these metrics would look like this:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/30934865-1761740552018732.png?io=w640\" alt=\"OXSQ's credit rating - Moody's approach\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"347\" height=\"178\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/30934865-1761740552018732.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/30934865-1761740552018732.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/30934865-1761740552018732.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/30934865-1761740552018732.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/30934865-1761740552018732.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/30934865-1761740552018732.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/30934865-1761740552018732.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/30934865-1761740552018732.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">OXSQ's credit rating - Moody's approach <span></span>(Author's Database)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But this rating may be misleading, and keep one thing in mind, as OXSQ is a young, small company that does not have secured debt.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OXSQ has been our number one short candidate in the BDC sector for quite some time, but we still think that the bonds are safer than they appear based on the regulatory leverage restrictions and their low duration.</p>",

In spring 2023, Ukraine was firing roughly 6,000–8,000 155mm shells per day—enough to match the entire U.S. pre-war monthly output (~14,000) in about two days—exposing a peacetime planning gap that can only be closed by new lines and plants, not just bigger budgets.<sup>2</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. <strong>Allied rearmament.</strong> Europe's shift from severe underinvestment to credible deterrence is real, and IndoPacific democracies are standing up capacity—South Korea exports, Japan remilitarizes, Australia invests and India accelerates domestic production. As one example, Germany's Bundestag passed a constitutional amendment allowing defense and security spending exceeding 1% of GDP to be exempt from the \"debt brake\" (Schuldenbremse), the fiscal rule that typically limits structural deficit to 0.35% of GDP. The package also establishes a €500 billion special fund for infrastructure and climate investments.<sup>3</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">3.<strong> Technology turnover.</strong> Drones, sensors, counter sensors, software and space have changed the cost curve. In Ukraine, 117 commercial drones—each costing around $2,000—destroyed over $1 billion in Russian aircraft in a single operation.<sup>4</sup> This illustrates how cheap, scalable payloads outperform legacy platforms. Old platform-centric procurement is giving ground to payloads, networks and software. That mix benefits companies that can iterate quickly and scale manufacturing—they are often companies with specialist moats or primes that control critical bottlenecks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>This is not a short-term, one-off</em>. This investment cycle is years of investment to compensate for decades of under-investment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">From Promises to Profits</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sometimes the boring parts of the supply chains are the most important. Propellants, rocket motors, fuses and warheads have proved to be the gating items for modern arsenals. When nations buy interceptors, cruise missiles and artillery shells, they are buying energy and guidance. That favors suppliers scaling capacity under multiyear, take-or-pay agreements.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Rheinmetall (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RNMBF\" title=\"Rheinmetall AG\">OTCPK:RNMBF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RNMBY\" title=\"Rheinmetall AG\">OTCPK:RNMBY</a>) has expanded its ammunition production capacity tenfold in just three years and now expects \"thousands and thousands\" of tank and vehicle orders over the next 12 months—scale that should push unit costs down despite surging demand. The company forecasts €80 billion in new orders by mid-2026, up from a €55 billion backlog the prior year, underscoring how automation and volume can reverse the usual defense-inflation story.<sup>5</sup> </li></ul> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>BAE Systems (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAESF\" title=\"BAE Systems plc\">OTCPK:BAESF</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAESY\" title=\"BAE Systems plc\">OTCPK:BAESY</a>) and RTX (Raytheon) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTX\" title=\"RTX Corporation\">RTX</a>) are central to resupplying guided and unguided munitions. RTX's missile franchises sit at the heart of layered air and missile defense; when interceptors are expended, orders follow.</li></ul> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>L3Harris (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LHX\" title=\"L3Harris Technologies, Inc.\">LHX</a>) absorbed Aerojet Rocketdyne—the U.S. solid rocket motor crown jewel—consolidating a critical chokepoint. Owning the motors means owning the pace of the missile supply chain.</li></ul> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>On the allied periphery, Poongsan (ammunition, South Korea) and Chemring (energetics and countermeasures, U.K.) represent the off U.S. capacity that NATO customers are increasingly reliant on.</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">You cannot rebuild a credible deterrent and reliable defense without investing in the fundamentals. When governments prioritize establishing and rebuilding stockpiles, the bottlenecks begin to emerge—propellants, motors, fuses—leading to potential pricing power and visibility. These dull parts of defense cannot be ignored.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The \"Invisible Arsenal\" and Backlog</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lethality is shifting from the platform you see to the sensors and waveforms you don't. Air defense is a radar and software problem; finding drones is a passive-sensing problem; surviving is an electronic warfare problem. These are not one-off upgrades. As adversaries jam and spoof, software, firmware and electronics need constant refresh. That points to recurring revenue and margin durability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is not meant to imply that the large platforms are obsolete. They remain the anchor of allied combat power, and their production rhythms are finally adjusting to geopolitics. Many of these platform providers represent a stable of programs where backlog visibility can be measured in years, not quarters. And the visibility is important. The platforms are slow to certify, but once certified, they throw off decades of production, retrofit and sustainment to the bottom line. Backlog is safety; upgradeability is upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While NATO rearmament creates a credible deterrence to military action from primarily Russia, the buildout of capabilities by Asian countries is about deterring China. When it comes to the newly emergent great power competition, it is a race between China and the U.S. It is largely played out in three ways:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">1.<strong> Sanctions and export control risk.</strong> The odds of value-destructive policy shocks for Chinese defense-adjacent equities are nontrivial. And the ability of the People's Republic of China should not be underestimated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2.<strong> Capital markets frictions.</strong> Index removals, audit standards and investment restrictions can prove difficult to anticipate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">3.<strong> Where capacity is actually growing for investors.</strong> The investable buildout is happening inside the U.S. alliance system and its close partners. South Korea is exporting at scale. India is ramping domestic champions. Europe is moving from intent to orders. Australia is embedding supply chains. That is likely to continue and should not be shrugged off.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Risk of Peace</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Defense stocks have rallied during periods in 2025, particularly when geopolitics turned for the worse. Peace, while the preferred state of the world, does not end the case for the long-term defense spending we are indicating. It refocuses it on earnings power and duration. Policy risk cuts both ways. Budget noise is perennial, but multiyear contracts for munitions and air defense are harder to reverse. The politics of stockpiles are different from traditional politics. Peace risk is the right kind of risk to own. If deterrence holds, arsenals still need to be rebuilt and rotated. If deterrence fails, demand accelerates. Either way, stockpiles do not build themselves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Which brings us to the flywheel that is often missed:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. Threat perception rises →</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. Allies raise budgets, place multiyear orders →</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. Industry invests in capacity (often with government support) →</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">4. Unit costs fall and delivery confidence rises →</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">5. More allies buy because supply is credible →</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">6. Backlogs extend and cash flows stabilize →</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">7. More capacity is justified.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For context, Europe is moving from \"pledges\" to orders. Germany's turning point (\"Zeitenwende\") started the psychological shift; Russia's sustained aggression locked it in. The NATO members that lagged are catching up, and the ones that led are rearming again. South Korea is an exporter with credibility on price and delivery. India is accelerating domestic programs and coproduction. Australia is reshaping its industrial base. Japan is breaking longstanding taboos and increasing spend. None of this requires guessing who wins the next election. It requires recognizing that allied democracies are rebuilding arsenals to buy time and stability and that rebuilding is measured in years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Deterrence as a Service</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is the focus of the <a href=\"https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/etfs/equity/wdgf\" rel=\"nofollow\">WisdomTree Global Defense Fund</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WDGF\" title=\"WisdomTree Global Defense Fund\">WDGF</a>): deterrence as a service. Missiles that hit, sensors that see, software that decides, satellites that connect, and the components and services that keep it all running. It spans the alliance system but excludes China to reduce political tail risk and stay aligned with where capital and technology sharing are deepening.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As with any thematic strategy, it is critical to look under the hood and understand that the businesses in the strategy have the desired exposure. In figure 1, we see that the <a href=\"https://www.wisdomtree.com/investments/index/wtgdef\" rel=\"nofollow\">WisdomTree Global Defense Index</a> (which the WisdomTree Global Defense Fund is designed to track<sup>6</sup>) has more than 80% exposure to companies that derive more than 50% of their revenues from defense activities. The <a href=\"https://www.wisdomtree.com/blog/glossary#MSCI%20World%20Aerospace%20and%20Defense%20Index\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSCI ACWI Aerospace and Defense Index</a> only has 51.4% exposure to such companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To put an even starker point on it, the WisdomTree strategy does not include companies with less than 25% of their revenues from defense activities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Figure 1: </strong><strong>Invest Where the Defense Revenues Really Are</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_figure-1-2.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 1: Invest Where the Defense Revenues Really Are\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"763\" height=\"384\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_figure-1-2.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_figure-1-2.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_figure-1-2.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_figure-1-2.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_figure-1-2.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_figure-1-2.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_figure-1-2.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_figure-1-2.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Sources: WisdomTree, FactSet.

There is no question that Palantir has built an incredible business, but the company's valuation as of October 2025 is polarizing. Palantir's blistering growth—revenue up 48% year over year in Q2 2025 and quadruple its 2020 level—has investors valuing it at roughly $415 billion,<sup>7</sup> a market cap that hearkens back to the peak multiples of the dotcom bubble's most extreme cases. Bulls argue that its unique moat—classified data access, high-level security clearances and AI-enabled analytics—positions it to dominate sensitive intelligence and defense software markets. Skeptics counter that at current valuations, Palantir would need to multiply revenue by 5.6 times while sustaining annual growth above 40% just to justify today's price, a bar even tech's most celebrated giants have rarely cleared.<sup>8</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That is the essence of the investment case. The world has moved from a theoretical need for defense to a practical one. The practical world pays invoices. And the companies positioned at the bottlenecks, at the refresh points, and at the nexus of software and steel are set to turn that reality into durable cash flows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For investors, this is a rare combination. Secular growth with government-level credit risk, global diversification within an alliance system and technology curves that are just starting to bend. The WisdomTree Global Defense Fund is built to track that bend—across bullets, bandwidth and the backlogs that make deterrence credible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><sup>1 </sup>\"Peace dividend,\" Fortune, 1968.

Foreign investing involves specific risks, such as risk of loss from currency fluctuation or political or economic uncertainty. Funds focusing their investments on certain sectors increase their vulnerability to any single economic or regulatory development. This may result in greater share price volatility. To the extent the Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in securities of companies of a single country or region, it is more likely to be impacted by events or conditions affecting that country or region. Investments in non-U.S. securities involve political, regulatory and economic risks that may not be present in investments in U.S. securities. Investments in non-U.S. securities may be subject to risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations, political or economic instability, or geographic events that adversely impact issuers of foreign securities. Investments in non-U.S. securities also may be subject to withholding or other taxes and may be subject to additional trading, settlement, custodial and operational risks. These and other factors can make investments in the Fund more volatile and potentially less liquid than other types of investments. These risks may be heightened to the extent the Fund invests in companies domiciled in or otherwise tied to developing or emerging market countries. The Fund invests in the securities included in, or representative of, its Index. The Index may not perform as intended. Please read the Fund’s prospectus for specific details regarding the Fund’s risk profile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618148757083876.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Christopher Gannatti, CFA, Global Head of Research\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"174\" height=\"174\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618148757083876.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618148757083876.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618148757083876.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618148757083876.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618148757083876.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618148757083876.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618148757083876.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618148757083876.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Christopher Gannatti, CFA, Global Head of Research</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Christopher Gannatti began at WisdomTree as a Research Analyst in December 2010, working directly with Jeremy Schwartz, CFA®, Director of Research.
