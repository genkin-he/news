Revenues are projected to rise another 3 to 4<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> percent in 2025, showing the continued strength of a sector that grows even as broader media habits shift. What drives this momentum is accessibility, digital connectivity, and cultural ubiquity. Gaming today spans generations, with nearly half of players identifying as female and a rising share of older adults now playing weekly. It is no longer just a pastime; it has become a primary channel for entertainment, creativity, and social interaction.</span></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s Not Just Kids Playing Video Games</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/fe641a483cde4f03942461c0dc5a758c/6350_espo-blog-charts_chart-1_2025-10_v1_blog.svg\" alt=\"It's Not Just Kids Playing Video Games\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: theesa.com as of 02.2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, the gaming business model has matured. Mobile now accounts for about half of global industry revenues, and in-game spending has become the dominant source of monetization. The shift from one-time purchases to ongoing digital transactions has created more predictable revenue streams and stronger engagement cycles. As studios continue to extend the lifespan of popular titles through updates, expansions, and live events, gaming has become a recurring digital economy rather than a series of standalone releases.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">In-App Purchases Are a Material Driver of Revenues</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/32286833de3e4a9b9d4246baabc0a431/6350_espo-blog-charts_chart-2_2025-10_v1.svg\" alt=\"In-App Purchases Are a Material Driver of Revenues\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Statista, as of 06.2025.

Over the past year, strong results from Nintendo, Roblox, and NetEase show how publishers are finding new ways to expand engagement and monetize their audiences. AppLovin was a standout contributor, as its AI-driven ad platform helped developers optimize user acquisition and improve profitability. Tencent also added to returns through steady performance across its global gaming operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some of these names, including AppLovin, Tencent, and AMD, are no longer part of the index due to ESPO’s strict requirement that at least half of company revenue come from gaming and esports. This approach ensures exposure stays pure and aligns with the industry’s long-term growth drivers, not broader tech trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key themes behind performance include:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Expansion of mobile and in-game revenue models supporting recurring growth.</li> <li>Strong content pipelines from global publishers extending franchise longevity.</li> <li>Increased use of AI tools in development, marketing, and player engagement.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AI Acceleration Moment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Artificial intelligence is emerging as the next major catalyst for gaming. In his recent appearance on the Thoughtful Money podcast, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck discussed how <a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/blogs/investment-outlook/jan-van-eck-q4-2025-outlook-escaping-the-reckoning/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\" title=\"Q4 2025 Outlook: Escaping the Reckoning?\">AI may be undervalued</a> by markets when it comes to creative industries. He noted that the leveraged buyout of Electronic Arts highlights how investors may be missing the intersection between AI and gaming’s potential for innovation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gaming companies are poised to embrace AI faster than many other industries because experimentation and rapid iteration are already central to their culture. AI streamlines every layer of the value chain, from how games are made, to how they are played, to how they are marketed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Developers are using AI to build and test new worlds in days instead of months. Gameplay is becoming more adaptive, with storylines and NPCs that respond to player behavior. Studios are marketing smarter, using data to target players and personalize content. Together, these advances are reshaping production cycles, improving engagement, and expanding profitability potential across the ecosystem.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI Game Developers are Adopting AI Tools in All Aspects of Development</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/7ea254e910a340fa9a339851ce013e5b/6350_espo-blog-charts_chart-3_2025-10_v1_blog.svg\" alt=\"AI Game Developers are Adopting AI Tools in All Aspects of Development\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Konvoy, as of 2025. For illustrative purposes only.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gaming’s New Playbook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The intersection of gaming and AI represents one of the most compelling growth frontiers in digital media. As AI tools lower production costs, enhance storytelling, and deepen engagement, gaming is positioned to remain one of the most globally connected and innovative industries. Leadership within the space will evolve, but the underlying growth drivers, including scalable intellectual property, recurring digital revenues, and expanding player engagement, remain firmly intact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The VanEck ESPO ETF captures this evolution through a focused portfolio of companies at the heart of the video gaming and esports ecosystem. By maintaining strict inclusion criteria and global diversification, it offers exposure to a sector that is not only growing but redefining how entertainment, technology, and digital identity intersect.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Approaching the Video Gaming and eSports Opportunity</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For investors, gaining exposure to this fast-changing sector requires focus. The video gaming and esports industry spans publishers, hardware manufacturers, and software platforms that directly generate revenue from interactive entertainment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The VanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF tracks the MVIS Global Video Gaming and eSports Index, which includes companies deriving at least 50 percent of revenue from gaming and esports-related activities. This rule ensures that the portfolio remains centered on companies truly driving industry growth rather than broader tech conglomerates with peripheral exposure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By combining exposure across publishers, developers, and hardware makers, the <a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/video-gaming-esports-etf-espo\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener\" title=\"ESPO - VanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF - Overview\">VanEck ESPO ETF</a> provides a comprehensive view into one of the most creative, innovative, and high-growth corners of global media. As AI accelerates how games are developed and experienced, ESPO offers a way to access that transformation through a disciplined, research-driven lens. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Important Disclosure</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is not an offer to buy or sell, or a recommendation to buy or sell any of the securities, financial instruments or digital assets mentioned herein.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAT\" title=\"Caterpillar Inc.\">CAT</a></span>) this year. By now, it appears that I've likely missed something as the stock has rallied ~40% since <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4820597-caterpillar-tariffs-continue-to-wreak-havoc-on-profitability\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">my latest article.</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> In that analysis I found signs that tariffs were wreaking havoc on the company's profitability and with the valuation being elevated I thought the risk/reward was unattractive. Caterpillar seems to have found a new catalyst: AI.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the analysis <span>below</span>, it is shown that AI is powering strong results in their Energy &amp; Transportation segment. While that's great news, tariff headwinds are alive and well. Profitability was significantly eroded with operating profit and EPS both declining YoY despite good demand. While there should be some optimism as a result of AI tailwinds, I believe the forward P/E's rapid expansion since the middle of the year shows that there has been too much exuberance with no easy fix for the company's profitability woes. The stock trades at a hefty premium and since there seems to be overvaluation, I have decided to stick with my sell rating for now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"649\" data-height=\"233\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Rating History\" width=\"640\" height=\"230\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"230\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand Is Picking Up</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"670\" data-height=\"421\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Sales\" width=\"640\" height=\"402\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"402\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Caterpillar Q3 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Caterpillar reported <a href=\"https://www.caterpillar.com/content/dam/caterpillarDotCom/releases/3q25/3q25-caterpillar-inc-financial-results.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2025 Q3 earnings</a> just very recently on October 29th and top-line results show signs that demand is starting to pick up. We'll go into more depth regarding where this strength is coming from a bit later but for Q3, the company as a whole reported sales and revenues of $17.638 billion. This is a fresh all-time record for Caterpillar and it represents growth of 10% YoY. That is a major bounce back after <a href=\"https://www.caterpillar.com/content/dam/caterpillarDotCom/releases/2q25/2q25-caterpillar-inc-financial-results.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">a 1% decline in sales and revenues</a> in their Q2 and so business activity has taken a major turn for the better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, they smashed <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAT/earnings\">consensus expectations</a> as they beat them by a whopping $864.15 million. Even for a company of their size, that is a substantial beat and so their top line was a pleasant surprise for sure. <a href=\"https://s25.q4cdn.com/358376879/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/3Q-2025-Analyst-Slide-Deck-vFinal.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">In the above chart</a> you can see that sales volume was the major driver for growth, again indicating that business activity has improved significantly. There was some minor weakness in price realization that may be an indication of an unfavorable mix but the effects are really negligible when compared to the considerable increase in volume. Lastly, as another sign that demand is becoming robust, Caterpillar reported that their backlog has hit $39.8 billion, a fresh all-time record. Of course, this is welcome news for investors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Energy &amp; Transportation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"719\" data-height=\"405\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Energy\" width=\"640\" height=\"361\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"361\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Caterpillar Q3 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As promised, let's see where all the top-line strength is coming from. Their Energy &amp; Transportation segment is currently their largest segment both by sales and profit and in Q3, it saw by far the strongest results. This is the segment that's directly involved with AI since <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510198-caterpillar-stock-jumps-as-ai-fueled-energy-demand-lifts-earnings\">AI data centers use</a> Caterpillar's battery storage systems and backup generators. I, for one, did not foresee AI providing significant tailwinds to their business but here we are and it really acts as a saviour to the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see above, total sales jumped by 17% YoY as they reported strong sales volume. Their Construction segment saw growth of just 7% while their Resource segment had just 2% growth. The importance of their Energy &amp; Transport segment doesn't end there, however. While profit margin expanded by 10 basis points in this segment, the other two segments saw considerable margin contraction and so in addition to driving top-line growth, AI tailwinds seem to be doing the heavy lifting in terms of the company's profitability. Overall, with AI data center construction showing no signs of slowing down, Caterpillar seems well-positioned to continue benefitting.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tariffs Still A Headwind</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1215\" data-height=\"531\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Tariffs\" width=\"640\" height=\"280\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"280\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Caterpillar Q3 Earnings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the above chart, the factors affecting operating profit are shown. Despite a healthy growth rate for the top line, operating profit actually fell 3% YoY to $3.052 billion. As you can see, the sales volume strength and price realization weakness carried over from their sales and revenues figures but the main cause of profitability weakness was due to manufacturing costs. In their earnings release, Caterpillar stated that \"unfavorable manufacturing costs largely reflected the impact of higher tariffs.\" This shows that despite the AI tailwinds they are benefitting from, the tariff headwinds that I highlighted in my previous article are still alive and well. If it weren't for the margin strength in their Energy &amp; Transportation segment, things could have been much worse for their profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of profits, Caterpillar reported an adjusted EPS of $4.95 for Q3, representing a 4.26% decline YoY. While that's still undesirable, do note that in Q2, they experienced a 21.2% decline for EPS and so there has been notable improvement. In addition, they managed to beat expectations by $0.43 to show outperformance and so despite the YoY decline, results were still better than feared.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash Flows &amp; Capital Returns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the profitability weakness, Caterpillar managed a nice improvement in cash flows. The company reported ME&amp;T free cash flows of $3.2 billion, representing an ~$500 million increase over the prior year period. While this is, of course, good news, shareholders may not be too thrilled that capital returns actually dropped YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q3, Caterpillar distributed a total of $1.1 billion, ~$700 million in the form of dividends and ~$400 million in the form of share repurchases. While total dividend payout remained relatively stable <a href=\"https://www.caterpillar.com/content/dam/caterpillarDotCom/releases/3q24/3q24-caterpillar-inc-financial-results.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">from the year-ago quarter,</a> stock buybacks dropped significantly YoY from ~$800 million. Therefore, while FCFs improved, the company doesn't seem too eager to share the cash with shareholders. That could be a sign of cautiousness from management.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Caterpillar provided limited numeric financial guidance but still gave some broad ideas of how the outlook is shaping up. For full year 2025, they now expect sales and revenues to be modestly higher than in 2024. This is a change in language from \"slightly higher\" and so in essence, they have raised their guidance. For Q4 in particular, they are expecting \"strong\" sales and revenue growth and so it appears that the AI tailwinds are indeed going to continue for their Energy &amp; Transportation business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With or without tariff effects included, Caterpillar expects the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to be in their annual target range. However, without tariffs, the figure would be in the top half of the range while with tariffs, the figure would be in the bottom half. Therefore, for 2025 as a whole, tariffs will be a significant drag on the company's profitability. Overall, I would say there are not many surprises in their outlook as the AI boost to sales and profitability weakness were already seen in their Q3.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors May Be Overoptimistic</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see in the chart above, Caterpillar's forward P/E ratio has been in a quite steady uptrend over the past few years. Since the middle of this year, it seems the expansion has picked up speed, and I believe the current reading of 31.45 shows excessive optimism.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Firstly, investors should definitely cheer the arrival of AI tailwinds. I, personally, did not foresee AI data centers having such a profound impact on their Energy &amp; Transportation business and so it's a pleasant surprise. However, the company is not out of the woods. Growth in their other two segments is still relatively sluggish and more importantly tariffs are weighing heavily on profitability. It is unlikely to be an easy fix for profitability as tariffs are really beyond the control of Caterpillar and so while overall demand is back on a good trajectory, headwinds are eroding that positivity as seen by the decline in operating profit and EPS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, I believe investors who are piling into the stock due to the new association with AI have become overoptimistic regarding their outlook. Note that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAT/valuation/metrics\">Seeking Alpha shows</a> the stock is trading at a nearly 50% premium to the Industrials sector according to the non-GAAP forward P/E ratio. Therefore, I would be very cautious about the current valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Concluding Remarks</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While there are some good signs for Caterpillar, in my view investors have gotten ahead of themselves. The elephant in the room was the big boost provided by AI tailwinds but while many are focusing on the resulting improved demand, I believe overlooking the profitability woes would be a mistake. Despite all the optimism, the company's profits actually shrank YoY due to tariffs and with no easy fix to this issue, I would say the outlook is still only mixed. Meanwhile, as shown above, the forward P/E has roared to a multiyear high and is at a major premium to the sector. I believe this shows investors have become a bit too exuberant on the stock. With Caterpillar being overvalued, I have decided to maintain my sell rating at this point.</p>",

It has, for the longest time, been my choice of investment in this sector thanks to superb fundamentals and overall very solid trends. Furthermore, unlike many of its peers, it<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> has not been suffering from excessive or overly high valuation levels. This has made the company, when it's attractively valued, my #1 choice. In the past 2 years, I have added to the company, but I went neutral on Infineon after it went too high a few months ago, back in the summer. </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802961-infineon-hope-you-bought-below-27-share\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802961-infineon-hope-you-bought-below-27-share\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has, since that article that you can find here,</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> reported 3</span><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731 paywall-full-content\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"3q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">Q25</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and is within 2-4 weeks of reporting 4</span><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731 paywall-full-content\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"4q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">Q25</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because of that, this article will focus on 2 things.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, provide a look at where Infineon is today and what makes the company potentially investable, now that it's down (as I expected) from the price when I last covered it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Secondly, to provide you with a preview of <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"4q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">4Q25</em>, my forecasts, and what I expect the company to be able to manage for the full year, as well as for 2027-2028.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The valuation for this company makes sense to me, unlike many of its peers that trade at multiples twice or even thrice as high as Infineon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Generally, analysts have been positive since <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"3q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">3Q25</em>. So am I. The company has declined despite what I believe to be a significant improvement in prospects and also somewhat in fundamentals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's look at what we have here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plenty to like, even if the valuation isn't as great</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Infineon is, in large part, a play on things like automotive chip/semiconductor markets. That means if you're bearish or not excessively bullish on the EV trends currently permeating the market, you should (like me) take a somewhat more conservative stance on the company and its potential. Not that it's going to go negative or anything - just not as bullish as some perhaps tend to be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's wrong, however, to say it's <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em>just<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em> EVs. Even the new generation of ICE vehicles needs all manner of sensors - voltage chips and the like, which are supplied by a market leader like Infineon. As I've mentioned earlier, the company is a great player in power efficiency in general, and if you notice what industries across the world are doing, power conservation is definitely part of this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">High-level risks to a legacy, Europe-located company such as this are very macro-oriented. We could mention the fact that China seems very set on developing its own chip industry in the country, but this also needs consideration that Infineon is actually a business that focuses on discrete power, rather than analog power management ICs.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1912\" data-height=\"995\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Infineon 3Q25 IR Presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"333\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Infineon <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"3q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">3Q25</em> IR Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So what the heck is the difference?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, the former, which is Infineon's focus, are things like transistors and resistors - while the latter are things like so-called PMICs, that combine functions in a single <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em>die<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em>.

Also, it forces Infineon to have manufacturing capacity different from its peers, leading to higher fixed costs in a scenario where supply exceeds demand. Because much of the demand comes from the automotive industry, this means that you should be prepared for volatility. Infineon has actually, as of the last few years, focused more on its automotive and industrial sectors, essentially increasing its exposure to that volatility in turn (divesting smaller business parts).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And while arguments in its favor are healthy growth from increases in products from Infineon, both in ICE and EVs, there is a commodity characteristic to the business that is hard to get away from. Further, because of its exposure to the EU, the company doesn't have access to the advantages of low labor costs that other companies enjoy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, the company performed very well during <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"3q\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">3Q</em>.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1909\" data-height=\"997\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Infineon 3Q25 IR Presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"334\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Infineon <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"3q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">3Q25</em> IR Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And while I've harped on the company's exposure to automotive, there's exposure to things like general e-mobility, renewables, software, IoT, AI and data that isn't to be underestimated either.

That PT still holds. The company is currently trading at €34.3. I considered raising my PT and fair value targets here, but ultimately decided that they still serve. However, I will make it clear here that once things start to grow, I will be raising the fair value and PT's to better reflect what I believe Infineon in a growth environment to be capable of, which is closer to a €50/share fair value at a 20x P/E for the 2028E fiscal, which would in turn imply a PT of about €42/share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But this requires better results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, buying at this valuation comes with a significant upside both to my previous fair value target of €38-€39/share, but also to a longer-term upside. The longer-term annualized RoR here is 15-16% per year at a 5-10 year average, and over 16% at the average 20-year P/E.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1708\" data-height=\"1336\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"F.A.S.T graphs Upside Infineon\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"501\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span><span></span>F.A.S.T. Graphs <span> Upside Infineon</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, since my last article, Infineon has dropped to valuations I would consider investable here. The combination of upside from 2026-2028E from a recovering automotive market, with the relatively low valuation and the company currently being in a dip, implies this. The fundamentals are reflective of this as well, including a BBB+ credit rating, a 1% yield (low, but safe, and growing), very low debt at below 22% long-term debt/capital, and a market cap, even with the drop, of below €44B at this time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Better alternatives with a similar risk profile are very rare at this time. You could make an argument for STMicroelectronics, which I've also made in a recent article where I covered the company. The upside is 15-17% here as well. I consider Infineon better than STM because of the depth of the EPS drop in STM; however, at this time it is expected to drop by over 60%. Infineon is, simply put, safer here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Texas Instruments, meanwhile, is in a remarkably similar trend as this company, with the exception of no near-term crash (the crash for TXN was in 2024, not 2025, also at about 24%). The issue I have with TXN is the forward valuation premium. This company requires 23-25x P/E to outperform, at 20x P/E like Infineon, it's essentially 0% growth or thereabouts - negative without the impressive 3.5%+ dividend that the company pays.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1720\" data-height=\"1340\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"F.A.S.T graphs TXN Upside\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"499\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span><span></span>F.A.S.T. Graphs <span> TXN Upside</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, ON Semiconductor (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ON\" title=\"ON Semiconductor Corporation\">ON</a>) may be undervalued, but it is also incredibly volatile and currently has no yield. Its range in the last 52 weeks has been between $31 and $76, which should express the depth of that volatility. The company is also, out of these, the only one with a junk-graded investment rating, and at 15x P/E, the 20-year average, is set to give less than 15% annualized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I therefore consider ON to be uninvestable here as well, with regard to my targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That brings alternatives to either STM or Infineon - and my choice here is Infineon.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"&amp;\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">&amp;</em> Considerations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Infineon were to significantly outperform and some risk factors were not to be as severe as expected, then price targets and fair values could go up to a €38/share or above mark, an attractive price target. Furthermore, historically, we've been able to see valuation levels of over 30x P/E, and if these come back, then the current valuation of 25x P/E is only the beginning. But as things currently stand, Infineon is set to recover as the automotive sector recovers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Significant risks for the company at this valuation are more general in nature. Commoditization of its industry, lower gross margins than its peers, and cyclicality not only of semis, but of end industries can cause further volatility, and for the recovery to take longer than expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond that, I do not view there to be many significant risks to my thesis and price target at this time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Infineon is a very solid business with a good long-term upside. It has sector leadership in multiple, crucial segments in the chip industry, and despite the commoditization of some of its end markets as well as the competitive position from China, I do not view it as unlikely that the company may outperform over the long term. In fact, I view it as likely, and this makes it a <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">Buy</em><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em> at the right price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't see anything in <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"3q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">3Q25</em> or the coming <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"4q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">4Q25</em> to change my thesis or expectation for the company from my assumption of <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">buy</em>, which leads me, as of this time, to increase my rating back to <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">buy</em>, and I maintain my previous PT of €35/share and fair value of €38-€39/share.

Clearly, the price action suggests that the market is not convinced that we will lose a significant amount of Russian oil supply. Yesterday’s meeting between President Trump and President Xi only served to strengthen this conviction, with Russian oil flows to China apparently not part of broader talks between the two leaders. This is important for the market given that China imports around 2m b/d of Russian oil. It’s the only buyer that could meaningfully increase its purchases if India reduced its imports of Russian crude.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On Sunday, OPEC+ is set to meet. It appears likely that the group will agree to another 137k b/d supply increase for December. The uncertainty surrounding sanctions on Russia also supports this increase. However, the move will only reinforce the bearish outlook for the market, adding to the substantial surplus expected through 2026. Obviously, this is assuming no supply shocks from Russia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Middle distillate cracks remain well-supported, with lingering uncertainty over the impact of sanctions on Russian diesel exports. The ICE gasoil crack is holding around $30/bbl, after a strong rally since mid-October. However, the latest data from Insights Global shows that gasoil inventories in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) region increased by 109kt WoW to 2.27mt, which saw its gap to the 5-year average widen. In Singapore, meanwhile, after a significant increase in middle distillate stocks the previous week, stocks declined by 6.25m barrels over the last week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">US natural gas Dec’25 futures rallied 3.7% yesterday, and the strength has continued in early morning trading today. The move higher comes despite US natural gas inventories rising by 74 bcf over the last week, in line with expectations and above the 5-year average increase of 67 bcf. Instead, the market appears to be focused on forecasts for cooler weather, which should prove supportive of demand.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Agriculture - China to buy 25mt of US soybeans annually</span></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CBOT soybean futures extended their upward rally, with prices surging more than 1.9% at one stage yesterday. This was after President Donald Trump announced that China would immediately purchase large volumes of US soybeans. Later, the US administration said that China agreed to buy 12mt of soybeans between now and January, with a further commitment to purchase at least 25mt annually over the next three years. The announced purchases are largely in line with China's imports of US soybeans prior to the trade war. For reference, China imported around 22mt of US soybeans in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The latest fortnightly report from the Brazilian Sugarcane and Bioenergy Industry Association (UNICA) shows that sugarcane crushing in Central-South Brazil stood at 34mt over the first half of October, an increase of 0.3% year-on-year. Sugar output over this period rose 1.25% YoY to 2.48mt. Meanwhile, the sugar mix in CS Brazil over the fortnight was 48.2%, up from 47.3% a year ago. This is despite prices suggesting that mills should favour a stronger ethanol mix. The cumulative cane crush so far this season still lags last year, down 2.8% to stand at 525mt, while cumulative sugar production totals 36mt, up 0.9% YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

My own position in Xerox was, as <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4746052-can-lexmark-save-xerox-i-say-maybe\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4746052-can-lexmark-save-xerox-i-say-maybe\" target=\"_blank\">my communication suggested, a \"small starter position\".</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But there's a difference between crashing that amount and being unrecoverable. When it comes to Xerox, in my last article, I made a case for why the company might be able to save ailing Lexmark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So the question here becomes, because it's been less than 11 months since that piece, is 11 months enough to answer the question of whether the company is going bankrupt?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would argue that it isn't.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This makes today, on earnings day of the 30th of October, an excellent day for updating my thesis on Xerox. Further, after a 60% decline and more, it might be fair to say that the company has dropped enough for me to be interested in investing after all.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Or am I?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's see here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Xerox—Looking at the potential upside on a forward basis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Xerox is, and remains, the leader in print solutions. That is the company's battle cry and what the company has been focusing on for a long time. However, as mentioned above, this industry is currently declining. Will it see a revitalization? I doubt it. Can Xerox corner what there is left, and what, despite the decline, won't go away?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Printing is unlikely to disappear entirely. Certain things are likely to remain needed in printed form. I belong to the group <a href=\"https://www.liontreegroup.com/graphic-design/is-print-really-dead-why-print-marketing-is-making-a-comeback/#:~:text=Print%20isn't%20dying%2C%20it's,%E2%80%93%20The%20Business%20Research%20Company%29.\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.liontreegroup.com/graphic-design/is-print-really-dead-why-print-marketing-is-making-a-comeback/#:~:text=Print%20isn't%20dying%2C%20it's,%E2%80%93%20The%20Business%20Research%20Company%29.\" target=\"_blank\">that believes that printing will not disappear</a> (nor physical material) but exist alongside digital—the question is at what size, and what will the market look at when that transformation is done.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some arguments for printed/physical material are the physical permanence it offers, security, and in many cases, legal needs of some areas and geographies. We have several things here that can only be done with physical print and copies, and I believe that things have gone too extreme to the digital side anyway. So a drop like the one we're seeing today in 3Q25, or the company's drop since the 2024 period, doesn't really faze me, unless it's based on some very real, fundamental trends.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1866\" data-height=\"956\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Xerox Investor Presentation 2025 IR\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"328\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Xerox Investor Presentation 2025 IR</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So what are the fundamental trends?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's remarkable how similar XRX is to some companies I've invested in at extreme lows. I've invested in companies like Unum Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNM\" title=\"Unum Group\">UNM</a>), Lincoln National Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LNC\" title=\"Lincoln National Corporation\">LNC</a>), and Intrum AB (publ) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ITJTY\" title=\"Intrum AB (publ)\">OTCPK:ITJTY</a>) as well as TUI AG. The commonality for every single one of these investments was that at the time of investing, serious analysts and investors were calling for bankruptcy risks. In the case of Intrum, bonds were trading at below 75 cents on the dollar to par. It was perceived as serious in every single case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, Unum is one of my better investments, Intrum is up 380%, and LNC is up more than 100%. I say this not to toot my own horn, but to tell you that I am comfortable with the ups and downs, provided I can understand them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Xerox is risky. EPS for 2025 is definitely going negative (in my view). The company is B- B-rated (Intrum was worse, was at CCC-). The company still pays a yield, which is something, but it's reduced. Debt is actually high, especially since they bought Lexmark valued at $1.5B, which is now more than 3x the entire market capitalization of the company at a price of below $4/share.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1878\" data-height=\"1026\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Xerox Investor Presentation 2025 IR\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Xerox Investor Presentation 2025 IR</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If there is one trait I believe you need as an investor going into something like this (as of today, I'm long Xerox), it's patience.

Of course, such an argument is an easy one to make, even if things just keep declining—but in this case, I do believe there is serious reason to expect recovery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I detailed in my original article, the company is likely to be able to leverage some key strengths. One, Lexmark's A4 platform, which is market-leading in the growing core market. It's also likely to be able to capitalize on Lexmark's A3 Models and OEM business, adding Xerox's considerable R&amp;D. Expansion into APAC is likely to drive this further as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is also shifting by expanding into digital services and IT solutions, both very attractive businesses, with areas like document workflows, intelligent document processing, and the like (though Xerox is likely to encounter substantial competition here).</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1867\" data-height=\"848\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Xerox Investor Presentation 2025 IR\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"291\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Xerox Investor Presentation 2025 IR</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason, dear readers, that I am positive here is because many of the synergies mentioned above are starting to materialize. Revenue is growing, and not in small amounts. It's almost up 25% YoY, and FCF is growing (up over 20%), with debt repayment in full force. The company's adjusted earnings are still impaired, together with operating margins, but again, Xerox is in the absolute middle of a transformation that will take years. No one at the company has told us to expect this to be done at this time. The synergies, as mentioned in the 3Q25, are back-heavy, with most of them coming either in 2026 or 2027. The only thing the company is expecting to manage this year is the initial elimination of double overhead and the like—the heavy stuff comes in the next 36 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In retrospect, I did make one big mistake. I shouldn't have gone positive when I did. I should have entered at a \"Hold\" and waited for some of these issues and likely valuation trends to arrive. The fact that I did not invest a substantial amount of capital yet is no excuse at all—I gave the rating, and this gives responsibility (in my view). Timing of valuation is never easy, and I, of course (obviously), could not expect this, but given the transformations that I've been a part of as an investor, I should have drawn logical links between my tendency to enter too early at times and let this flow to ratings as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I didn't.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So let me be clearer this time. If you invest here, be ready for further declines—not guaranteed, but entirely possible. Xerox now has a load of debt that is unenviable, but most of that debt is laden toward the end of 2029-2039—by that time, we should know whether the company has succeeded or not.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current timeline we have is 2026-2028. For the remainder of the year, the two positive takeaways and expectations we do have are a significant increase in FCF and an operating margin that's likely to trend toward 4-5%. If the company manages this, it will be good. I expect the company in 2026 to manage flat revenue but to be able to go over $300M of gross cost reductions, be able to really start reshaping things here, which should enable an FCF of above $300M per year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That should start to allow for higher valuations here. My current forecast for 2026 is about a dollar's worth of EPS, compared to about the same level last fiscal, and for that to grow by 30-40% in fiscal 2027. Those improvements are likely, in my view, to come from the aforementioned synergies, growth in IT and digital (but I'm less optimistic on this than other analysts), and continued significant downpayment of debt. Since the M&amp;A, almost every cent has gone to paying that down, the best current use of cash. The entry back into the mid-market for printing<a href=\"https://www.explorexeroxproducts.com/Product/Index/IJP900_XPE?Language=en-US&amp;Region=NARS\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.explorexeroxproducts.com/Product/Index/IJP900_XPE?Language=en-US&amp;Region=NARS\" target=\"_blank\"> through the IJP900 is also something I consider to be likely to boost revenues.</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's see what we can make of valuation after 3Q25.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation for Xerox in 2025—look at 2026-2027</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you want to invest here, expect a recovery and profit period of no less than 3 years. My own forecast is this. As I said in my previous article, the market considers most of Xerox's sales to be worthless here. Why do I say this?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because it's currently trading at less than 0.2 to sales, less than 0.7x to revenues, and a book valuation of 0.55x. This is, by the way, despite the fact that analysts are in agreement that revenue is likely to recover close to 2019 levels and above, potentially.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"3026\" data-height=\"2017\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Xerox Revenues TIKR.com\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Xerox Revenues TIKR.com</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Same thing, by the way, with EBITDA.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"3026\" data-height=\"2017\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Xerox EBITDA forecasts TIKR.com\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Xerox EBITDA forecasts TIKR.com</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So if both sales and earnings are likely to increase in the future, what could the company be worth?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Depends. And this is what makes a company like this interesting. Less than 1-2 years ago, when the company made $1/share in EPS, it traded at a 12-14x P/E. It currently trades at a negative P/E due to negative earnings this year. But if earnings were to recover to even close to this, and the market saw Xerox at a similar valuation, we're talking several hundred percent in returns.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1722\" data-height=\"1486\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FAST Graphs Xerox Upside\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"552\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FAST Graphs Xerox Upside</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And remember, the forecast you see above is not based on anything outlandish. If the company manages a net savings amount of $300M over the next few years, this would obviously substantially improve the company's cash flow, which in turn would increase net income. That is what I believe the recovery will come from. The $18/share fair value suggested above isn't even unrealistic, if the company manages this, Xerox traded at $18/share less than 2 years ago, and to my mind it was riskier back then because it didn't have the turnaround plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I've made it part of my investment approach to invest in distressed value, as I call it. Xerox, as I see it, is distressed value. The company is \"down\", but it's getting back up. I don't see any clear risk for bankruptcy or issues. The credit risk is considered high when you look at some bonds out there (try USU98401AE97, for instance), but when you look at what the company manages in EBITDA, revenues, debt payments, and the like, I don't really see the company going bankrupt.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1831\" data-height=\"1001\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Xerox Investor Presentation 2025 IR\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Xerox Investor Presentation 2025 IR</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a risky business, but if you're comfortable with what I consider \"manageable risk,\" then this is for you. I'm taking and adding a long 0.25% position of my portfolio in Xerox at this time, resulting in a 0.29% position, and I expect a big payoff eventually, well over 100-200%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My price target was $14/share. I'm cutting it to fair value $12/share at a $1.2/share EPS and a 10x P/E, with an upside of over 200%. My PT is therefore $8/share, but that makes this company a discount at this price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks &amp; Considerations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market considers Xerox sales \"worthless\". It now also considers the earnings and most of the other parts of the company worthless, going by the way it's valuing the business. It's trading at less than 0.2x to sales, less than 0.7x to revenues, and less than 0.8x to book. The company's book value at this time is higher than the share price, and at almost $3-4/share, not a small amount more than the share price. With Lexmark, this is even better, and I continue to see the risks being outweighed by the positives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Print declines and the company not succeeding in the turnaround remain the core risk here. Because this is such a substantial risk at this point, I would be careful investing at all here, unless you really are comfortable with the sort of risk/reward this offers but also requires in terms of patience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a real potential, just like with Intrum, of a capital loss here, but I consider that to be very unlikely based on 3Q25 and the company seeming to move forward with its turnaround plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Count me in for now with the following thesis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Xerox offers, following the Lexmark deal and 3Q25 results, an attractive play on printing and printing services, as well as related IT. Following this, the company is becoming a vertically integrated producer and service-offering business, which is attractive, if high-risk.</li> <li>I consider Xerox to be exceedingly cheap here, but the company is a speculative investment. However, this is something I am comfortable with, and I'm increasing my position.</li> <li>I give the company an updated PT of $8/share and a fair value target of $12/share, above which I might sell, depending on how quickly it \"went there\". However, the potential for $18-20 over time is definitely there.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (<em>italicized</em>).</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em>This company is overall qualitative.</em></li> <li>This company is fundamentally safe/conservative &amp; well-run.</li> <li>This company pays a well-covered dividend.</li> <li><em>This company is currently cheap.</em></li> <li><em>This company has a realistic upside based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion.</em></li> </ul> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company fulfills 1 out of 3 quality indicators and 2 out of 2 valuation indicators. That means 3/5 \"stars\" here, which is enough for an attractive thesis for the company. Based on this and a price target of $8/share share, I see a risk/reward-adjusted upside that's attractive enough for me. I give the company a \"Buy\" rating as of October 2025.</p>",

Market concentration and style factors continued to be headwinds for the portfolio as returns have been dominated by AI stocks, cyclical<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> companies and interest rate-sensitive financials, which are expected to benefit from deregulation.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Health Care holdings were the largest detractor. The sector has been under pressure due to US policy announcements aimed at lowering the price of healthcare. It has also proven a source of funds for investors looking to allocate into the AI theme. However, the announcement of a deal to provide lower prescription prices for government-funded Medicaid patients, but not the larger Medicare channel, may be a turning point for the sector as this lifts some of the regulatory overhang and provides greater clarity for research and development spending. This would be positive for the portfolio’s exposure to the drug discovery value chain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dynamics in the Financials sector have also worked against the portfolio, as easing of regulation favoured large-cap banks which benefit from an increase in capital market related activity. European regional bank KBC (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KBCSY\" title=\"KBC Group NV\">OTCPK:KBCSY</a>) rallied, but companies that typically deliver more consistent earnings through economic cycles, such as consultant Marsh &amp; McLennan (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MMC\" title=\"Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc.\">MMC</a>), have traded lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The lack of exposure to commodities within the Materials sector created a relative headwind, whilst sustainable construction materials maker Sika (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SXYAY\" title=\"Sika AG\">OTCPK:SXYAY</a>) came under pressure as the European construction market remains sluggish. Within Industrials, concerns over AI potentially disrupting business models were negative for data service providers, though better performance came from companies improving resource efficiency or benefiting from energy management and electricity grid investment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consumer Discretionary holdings have been a bright spot with eBay (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EBAY\" title=\"eBay Inc.\">EBAY</a>), which delivered strong results after management refocussed the business on core platforms, rallying. The portfolio’s auto component company Aptiv (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APTV\" title=\"Aptiv PLC\">APTV</a>) rebounded from its lows and gained momentum after it announced a divestment that allows it to focus on higher-margin advanced driving applications, Within Information Technology, companies with exposure to AI infrastructure also performed well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Market overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global equities posted strong gains in Q3 2025, supported by resilient macroeconomic conditions, improving corporate earnings, fiscal stimulus and deregulation in the banking sector. However, market dynamics favouring hypergrowth, cyclical and value stocks have created headwinds for investors focused on quality, and market concentration increased over the period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) in the US was a key catalyst early in the quarter, providing short-term stimulus through extended tax cuts and incentives for domestic reshoring. While concerns linger over its longer-term impact on the US fiscal deficit and inflation, the OBBB helped lift investor sentiment, particularly in large-cap and technology stocks. The US Federal Reserve’s September interest rate cut also helped to support share prices and extend the risk-on rally in equities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emerging markets also performed well, buoyed by a weaker US dollar and supportive policy measures in China, which included new renewable energy standards targeting high-emission industries and support for the technology sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we end Q3, US regulatory uncertainty has eased for Health Care stocks with the announcement of a deal between President Trump and drug company Pfizer to lower prescription drug prices for the government-funded Medicaid programme. In the short term, the US government shutdown may weigh on investor sentiment but historically these shutdowns have been resolved with little impact on equity markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite elevated valuations and increased market concentration, the investment team believe opportunities exist in stocks that have been de-rated despite strong earnings momentum and among companies demonstrating strong secular growth. The investment team remains focused on identifying businesses with durable growth drivers, sound management and attractive relative valuations.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p>Performance (%)</p></td> <td colspan=\"2\"><p>Total return</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td colspan=\"2\"><p>Average annual return</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>1M</p></td> <td><p>3M</p></td> <td><p>YTD</p></td> <td><p>1Y</p></td> <td><p>3Y</p></td> <td><p>5Y</p></td> <td><p>10Y</p></td> <td><p>SI 1</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Institutional Class</p></td> <td><p>1.12</p></td> <td><p>1.75</p></td> <td><p>10.42</p></td> <td><p>1.63</p></td> <td><p>15.87</p></td> <td><p>8.59</p></td> <td><p>-</p></td> <td><p>9.99</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Investor Class</p></td> <td><p>1.07</p></td> <td><p>1.71</p></td> <td><p>10.25</p></td> <td><p>1.41</p></td> <td><p>15.59</p></td> <td><p>8.31</p></td> <td><p>-</p></td> <td><p>9.75</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>MSCI ACWI</p></td> <td><p>3.62</p></td> <td><p>7.62</p></td> <td><p>18.44</p></td> <td><p>17.27</p></td> <td><p>23.12</p></td> <td><p>13.54</p></td> <td><p>-</p></td> <td><p>11.51</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Performance data quoted represent past performance, which does not guarantee future results.

The company is benefitting from sustained demand for its cloud infrastructure platform and AI-powered applications. During the period, a US$500bn project was announced with OpenAI and Softbank to build five new AI data centres in the US.</li> <li>Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>)(Semiconductors, US) outperformed during the period as investors rewarded the chip maker’s robust demand outlook driven by surging capital expenditures from ‘hyperscale’ data centre operators.</li> <li>TE Connectivity (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TEL\" title=\"TE Connectivity plc\">TEL</a>)(Electronic Manufacturing Services, US) generated strong performance in Q3, as faster-than-expected data centre revenue and margin expansion from their Industrial Solutions segment facilitated very strong quarterly results.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Detractors (absolute basis)</strong> </p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>London Stock Exchange (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LDNXF\" title=\"London Stock Exchange Group plc\">OTCPK:LDNXF</a>)(Financial Exchanges &amp; Data, UK) has been impacted by concerns that AI may disrupt its Data &amp; Analytics business model which provides investment solutions, risk tools and wealth &amp; enterprise tools. London Stock Exchange is integrating AI into its own business model and believes that the business is defendable as it is based on real-time data, which is hard to replicated with AI, and customers operate within a regulated framework and need to rely on a trusted, verifiable source.</li> <li>Alcon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALC\" title=\"Alcon Inc.\">ALC</a>)(Health Care Supplies, Switzerland) traded lower after Q2 equipment sales for eye surgery were softer than expected. Management indicated orders for its new system ‘Unity’ remain robust, but its launch is being deliberately phased to allow time to train eye surgeons. It will take time to convert these orders to installations and sales, however there should be an acceleration in the second half of the year.</li> <li>Intuitive Surgical (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ISRG\" title=\"Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\">ISRG</a>)(Health Care Equipment, US) has been weak due to news that a competitor is providing refurbished and repurposed instruments at lower prices. However, Intuitive believes price is only one component customers consider, with reliability, security of supply, accuracy and innovation also factors in decision making. Meanwhile, the market for surgical robotics continues to expand with new applications in areas such as cardiac surgery.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market has gone through another period of extreme concentration, with investors’ focus returning heavily to the AI theme and more cyclical or ‘hypergrowth’ stocks. This has resulted in a de-rating of many companies that the investment team believes continue to deliver strong fundamental performance and offer compelling structural growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, within Health Care, the portfolio is focussed on companies providing solutions which reduce the time or cost of drug development or improve patient outcomes through innovative products and services. The headwinds which have impacted the sector may now have reached a peak, leading investors to re-examine their appetite for these companies given the clear strength of sector tailwinds such as innovation of treatments and ageing populations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Within Financials, the portfolio holds companies that are improving access to finance, and businesses which offer greater operational consistency such as data analytics, payment processors and financials consultancy businesses, rather than cyclical, leveraged 'balance sheet' financials. While these stocks are currently out of favour, we believe they remain well placed to benefit from structural growth and deliver superior long-term returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the portfolio retains holdings in a range of companies that the team sees as able to capture either revenue or cost opportunities through implementing AI innovation into their operations. Some of these stocks have been under pressure as investors anticipate disruption to their business models, while our investment team expects these companies, which include recruitment platforms, semiconductor chip designers and stock exchange operators, to benefit from their investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The investment team’s focus remains on finding companies with compelling structural growth, with quality characteristics at reasonable valuations. The team believes that the portfolio offers truly diversified exposure to multiple powerful trends across both environmental and social sustainability opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Fund overview</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Impax Global Opportunities Fund is a long-only all-cap global equities strategy that invests in high quality companies with sustainability tailwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio managers</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Kirsteen Morrison, David Winborne</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CFA® is a trademark owned by CFA Institute.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Performance attribution as of 09/30/2025</p></td></tr> <tr> <td><p>Sector: Average active weights (%)</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Communication Services</p></td> <td><p>-7.28</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Consumer Discretionary</p></td> <td><p>-6.28</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Consumer Staples</p></td> <td><p>-1.84</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Energy</p></td> <td><p>-3.54</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Financials</p></td> <td><p>1.82</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Health Care</p></td> <td><p>8.24</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Industrials</p></td> <td><p>5.32</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Information Technology</p></td> <td><p>3.81</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Materials</p></td> <td><p>2.30</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Real Estate</p></td> <td><p>-1.93</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Utilities</p></td> <td><p>-2.58</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Cash</p></td> <td><p>1.94</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p>Portfolio characteristics</p></td> <td><p>As of 09/30/2025</p></td> </tr> <tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Market cap (weighted average) ƒ</p></td></tr> <tr> <td> <p>Fund</p> <p>US$564BN</p> </td> <td> <p>Benchmark</p> <p>US$907BN</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Forward price earnings~</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Fund</p> <p>21.2x</p> </td> <td> <p>Benchmark</p> <p>19.1x</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>ROE ο</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Fund</p> <p>22.1%</p> </td> <td> <p>Benchmark</p> <p>21.7%</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Beta∞</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Fund</p> <p>0.95</p> </td> <td> <p>Benchmark</p> <p>-</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Number of securities</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Fund</p> <p>38</p> </td> <td> <p>Benchmark</p> <p>2,509</p> </td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Total relative contribution (%)</p></td></tr> <tr> <td><p>Communication Services</p></td> <td><p>-0.50</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Consumer Discretionary</p></td> <td><p>0.44</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Consumer Staples</p></td> <td><p>-0.22</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Energy</p></td> <td><p>0.09</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Financials</p></td> <td><p>-1.42</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Health Care</p></td> <td><p>-2.13</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Industrials</p></td> <td><p>-0.71</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Information Technology</p></td> <td><p>-0.26</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Materials</p></td> <td><p>-0.92</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Real Estate</p></td> <td><p>0.10</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Utilities</p></td> <td><p>0.08</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Cash</p></td> <td><p>-0.16</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total</p></td> <td><p>-5.62</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Definitions</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><em>ƒ</em></p></td> <td><p>Weighted Average is an average in which each quantity to be averaged is assigned a weight.

Over the last decade, private equity and credit strategies have surged in popularity due to their unique return and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> yield potential. However, these typically come with the trade-off of reduced liquidity due to lockup periods. Recently, though, the importance of liquidity, especially in a market rife with uncertainties, is becoming more pronounced. In today's market, where liquidity is highly prized, public Business Development Companies (BDCs) present a compelling, liquid alternative to traditional private credit strategies.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand for Private Credit (and Liquidity) is Growing</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Private credit strategies have soared in popularity, offering attractive return and diversification opportunities. They have granted investors access to niche markets and to distinct return profiles, which has fueled asset growth in the space, with market estimates predicting this growth to continue as assets under management are expected to eclipse $3 trillion by 2028.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand for Private Credit Expected to Continue | 2014-2024</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/0e6ce7bf5d4148ebb1a7e937edc159c5/6303_bdcs-la-pc_chart-1_2025-10_v3_blog.svg\" alt=\"Demand for Private Credit Expected to Continue | 2014-2024\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Preqin, Moody’s Ratings.

Investors, now more than ever, are prioritizing the ability to access and redeploy capital swiftly. This heightened emphasis on liquidity is leading many to reconsider the long lockup periods associated with traditional private market strategies, resulting in a pivot towards more liquid investment vehicles, like public BDCs, that can offer a similar exposure without liquidity constraints.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">BDCs: The Liquid Alternative to Private Credit</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business Development Companies are publicly traded entities focused on lending to and investing in private businesses. Established to promote investment in small- and mid-sized firms, BDCs open doors to private credit markets. A standout advantage of public BDCs is their inherent liquidity. Unlike traditional private credit funds, which often have multi-year lockup periods, public BDCs are listed on major stock exchanges and can be traded daily. This grants investors the ability to modify their positions in response to market changes, personal financial needs or altered investment tactics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although there is no true index for the entire private credit market, the PitchBook Private Debt All US Index, which represents the performance of all closed-end private debt funds in the United States within PitchBook’s universe, can be used as a general proxy to understand how the performance of public BDCs compares to the broad private credit market. Looking at the below performance chart, BDCs have largely performed in line with private credit over the last 10 years. During this period, public BDCs have exhibited a high correlation to the private credit market, with the most visible difference between the two return streams being the apparent lack of volatility in the private market. However, this is more a result of lower liquidity and lack of price discovery in traditional private markets.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Long-Term BDC Performance in Line with Private Credit Market | 2014-2024</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/0e6ce7bf5d4148ebb1a7e937edc159c5/6303_bdcs-la-pc_chart-2_2025-10_v1_blog.svg\" alt=\"Long Term BDC Performance in Line with Private Credit Market | 2014-2024\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Morningstar Direct.

Private debt or credit fund lockup periods can be both an asset and a liability. While they can insulate investors from short-term market fluctuations, they can also hinder capital access during extended downturns or unexpected liquidity requirements. Thus, an increasing number of investors are opting for BDCs as a more liquid alternative.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Merits of a Diverse BDC Investment Strategy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are many publicly traded BDCs available in the market today, each with distinct risk profiles based on their asset structures, sector and credit exposures, financing terms and management quality. Investing in individual BDCs demands rigorous research to fully understand each entity. A holistic market approach to BDC investment can offer industry-wide diversification, negating the need for granular BDC assessments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/bdc-income-etf-bizd\" title=\"BIZD - VanEck BDC Income ETF | Overview\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>VanEck BDC Income ETF</strong></a> <strong>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIZD\" title=\"VanEck BDC Income ETF\">BIZD</a>)</strong> offers broad market exposure to publicly traded U.S. business development companies and may be appealing for those looking for a liquid alternative to private credit funds.

Returns reflect past performance and do not guarantee future results. Results reflect the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Certain indices may take into account withholding taxes. Index returns do not represent Fund returns. The Index does not charge management fees or brokerage expenses, nor does the Index lend securities, and no revenues from securities lending were added to the performance shown.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business Development Companies (BDC<span>s</span>) generally invest in less mature U.S. private companies or thinly traded U.S. public companies which involve greater risk than well-established publicly-traded companies. While the BDCs that comprise the Index are expected to generate income in the form of dividends, certain BDCs during certain periods of time may not generate such income. The Fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any management fees and other operating expenses incurred by the BDCs and of any performance-based or incentive fees payable by the BDCs in which it invests, in addition to the expenses paid by the Fund. A BDC’s incentive fee may be very high, vary from year to year and be payable even if the value of the BDC’s portfolio declines in a given time period. Incentive fees may create an incentive for a BDC’s manager to make investments that are risky or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of such compensation arrangements, and may also encourage the BDC’s manager to use leverage to increase the return on the BDC’s investments. The use of leverage by BDCs magnifies gains and losses on amounts invested and increases the risks associated with investing in BDCs. A BDC may make investments with a larger amount of risk of volatility and loss of principal than other investment options and may also be highly speculative and aggressive. The Fund and its affiliates may not own in excess of 25% of a BDC's outstanding voting securities which may limit the Fund's ability to fully replicate its index. An investment in the Fund may be subject to risks which include, among others, investing in BDCs, investment restrictions, financial sector, small- and medium-capitalization companies, equity securities, market, operational, index tracking, authorized participant concentration, no guarantee of active trading market, trading issues, passive management, fund shares trading, premium/discount and liquidity of fund shares, issuer-specific changes, and index-related concentration risks, all of which may adversely affect the fund.

(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCZMF\" title=\"Santacruz Silver Mining Ltd.\">OTCPK:SCZMF</a>) is a mining company, operating mines across Mexico and Bolivia. My investment thesis for the company is premised on SCZMF capitalizing on rising silver prices by increasing production. A rise in silver prices would have a<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> disproportionate effect on the earnings of SCZMF, which has been substantiated below. Hence, SCZMF is an opportunity to leverage an ongoing silver upcycle. I anticipate an increase in production in 2026 from the Bolivar mine's production normalizing from Q4 2025 onwards and an increase in the proportion of ore processed from Level 960 of the Zimapan mine. These would decrease AISC and increase the silver equivalents produced by SCZMF. Due to these factors, I am initiating coverage on SCZMF with a Buy rating and a target price of $2.77 (equivalent to ~$11.08 on 4:1 consolidation due to NASDAQ listing).</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">About The Company</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SCZMF works in the operation, acquisition, development, and exploration of mines across the Americas. The company primarily focuses on silver and zinc and secondarily on lead and copper. SCZMF owns mines across Bolivia and Mexico.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Bolivia, the company has 100% ownership of the Tres Amigos and the Colquechita mines (the Caballo Blanco Group) and the Don Diego Processing Plant. The San Lucas Group is a unit of SCZMF and is involved in the ore feed sourcing and trading business and includes the Reserva mine. SCZMF also owns the Soracaya Exploration Asset in Bolivia. In 2022, <a href=\"https://santacruzsilver.com/santacruz-silver-announces-the-closing-of-its-acquisition-of-glencores-producing-bolivian-silver-zinc-assets/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://santacruzsilver.com/santacruz-silver-announces-the-closing-of-its-acquisition-of-glencores-producing-bolivian-silver-zinc-assets/\" target=\"_blank\">SCZMF acquired</a> the operational and profit-sharing rights of Glencore to the Bolivar and Porco mines. SCZMF is entitled to 45% of the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses from these two mines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Mexico, the company owns the Zimapan mine and processing plant in Hidalgo.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-17616353540394807_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2452\" data-height=\"1182\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-17616353540394807_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Santacruz Silver Mining's Asset Structure\" width=\"640\" height=\"309\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"309\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-17616353540394807_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-17616353540394807_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-17616353540394807_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-17616353540394807_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-17616353540394807_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-17616353540394807_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-17616353540394807_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-17616353540394807_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">SCZMF's Asset Structure <span>(Company Website)</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reduced AISC and Paid Off Glencore Consideration</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SCZMF has <a href=\"https://wp-santacruzsilver-2023.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/2025/08/2025_Q2_MDA_Santacruz_Silver_Mining.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://wp-santacruzsilver-2023.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/2025/08/2025_Q2_MDA_Santacruz_Silver_Mining.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">successfully reduced</a> its All-in Sustaining Cost (AISC) per Silver Equivalent Ounce (AgEq), particularly from its Bolivian mines due to the devaluation of BOB and the company shifting to using the real market rate as compared to the artificially fixed rate. This made BOB significantly cheaper for the company, enabling them to reduce the AISC in dollar terms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Higher recoveries, especially in the Caballo Blanco Group, have also been a factor in favor of reducing AISC.

Overall, AISC reduced 8% YoY due to these factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The acquisition of the mining rights of Bolivar and Porco from Glencore in Q1 2022 came at a significant cost to SCZMF.

The interest expense from the deferred portion significantly weighed down earnings. The debt obligation also led the management to restructure the business since the high consideration payable led to total equity being negative for 2022 and 2023.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-1761650689223644_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2172\" data-height=\"632\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-1761650689223644_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Santcruz Silver Mining's Financial Strength Following Acquisition of Bolivar and Porco Mines\" width=\"640\" height=\"186\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"186\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-1761650689223644_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-1761650689223644_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-1761650689223644_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-1761650689223644_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-1761650689223644_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-1761650689223644_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-1761650689223644_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/61356945-1761650689223644_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Effective Restructuring to meet Glencore Obligation <span>(Company Website)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following the <a href=\"https://www.bullionbypost.com/silver-price/10-year-silver-price/\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.bullionbypost.com/silver-price/10-year-silver-price/\" target=\"_blank\">silver bull run</a> since the end of Q1 2024, SCZMF's cash position increasingly strengthened due to operating leverage playing out.

The positive effect of the restructured payments is that the company can move faster towards the production of its mines, strengthening its cash position.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Production to Increase, with Marginal Rise in Head Grade</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect SCZMF to see dampened production for Q3, mainly due to the Bolivar mine getting flooded in mid-May. This flood <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SCZMF/earnings/SCZMF-Q2-2025-earnings_call-386192.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SCZMF/earnings/SCZMF-Q2-2025-earnings_call-386192.html\" target=\"_blank\">mainly affected</a> the Pomabamba South and Tanane Reyes areas, both of which are high silver head grade veins. The Bolivar mine's ore is relatively rich in silver and has the highest head grade of silver among all mines operated by SCZMF, 237 g/ton (<a href=\"https://wp-santacruzsilver-2023.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/2025/06/2025-Q1-MDA-Santacruz-Silver-Mining.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://wp-santacruzsilver-2023.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/2025/06/2025-Q1-MDA-Santacruz-Silver-Mining.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Q1 2025</a>). Hence, the company gets more silver for a relatively lower AISC from this mine in particular. Following the flood, head grades for silver reduced by 20% and zinc by 7% QoQ for the Bolivar mine.

This is most prominent in the photovoltaic demand for silver due to the solar energy boom, which accounts for over <a href=\"https://silverinstitute.org/silver-supply-demand/#silver_demand\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://silverinstitute.org/silver-supply-demand/#silver_demand\" target=\"_blank\">17%</a> of total silver demand. I expect this proportion to rise by 2030, as solar PV manufacturer demand increases, especially in China, where solar capacity is <a href=\"https://www.energetica-india.net/news/chinas-solar-energy-capacity-set-to-double-by-2030-driven-by-pv-tech-and-policy-push\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.energetica-india.net/news/chinas-solar-energy-capacity-set-to-double-by-2030-driven-by-pv-tech-and-policy-push\" target=\"_blank\">set</a> to double by 2030. Silver is also a critical component of the digital world due to its role in semiconductor chips and PCBs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Silver has another type of demand that is pushing its price: investment demand. With the Fed predicted, by the <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" target=\"_blank\">CME FedWatch tool,</a> to ease rates, silver demand in the short term will go higher due to its use as an inflation hedge. The <a href=\"https://www.gainesvillecoins.com/blog/central-bank-silver-purchases-russia-smart-money-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.gainesvillecoins.com/blog/central-bank-silver-purchases-russia-smart-money-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Central Bank of Russia plans</a> to invest $535 million in precious metals, with an explicit mention of silver, from 2025 to 2027. This marks a landmark shift from decades of central banks' avoidance of maintaining meaningful silver reserves. In the short term, silver may be highly volatile due to the currently uncertain nature of global trade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Approximately <a href=\"https://www.sfa-oxford.com/rare-earths-and-minor-metals/minor-metals-and-minerals/silver-47-ag/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.sfa-oxford.com/rare-earths-and-minor-metals/minor-metals-and-minerals/silver-47-ag/\" target=\"_blank\">70%</a> of silver produced is as a by-product of mining other minerals such as lead, copper, and zinc. Due to the low proportion of primarily silver-producing mines, supply is largely inelastic since it would be uneconomical for miners to expand operations if silver is just a by-product. At the same time, SCZMF operates primarily silver mines and may be able to capitalize on the ongoing cycle of silver demand by ramping up ore extraction and processing capacity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zinc prices are <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/zinc\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/zinc\" target=\"_blank\">currently increasing</a> due to supply constraints that are being outpaced by demand. I expect this supply issue to be temporary and zinc prices to normalize.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market currently faces a constrained supply of zinc. Mine depletion and closures, with ore smelting and treatment becoming uneconomical, are the major reasons for tightening supply. The current shortage seems evident if we look at the current global zinc inventory crisis. The <a href=\"https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/zinc-market-tightness-2025-inventory-depletion/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/zinc-market-tightness-2025-inventory-depletion/\" target=\"_blank\">London Metal Exchange currently holds inventory</a> enough to satisfy ~3 days of global consumption, which is uncharacteristically low.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These factors have led to the present rise in zinc prices, but it is important to note that the current inventory crisis and supply squeeze due to low zinc ore concentrate availability causing uneconomical smelting may be temporary. I believe that the current price increase is simply a result of inventory positioning, and supply will soon return to meet the demand.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings Projections And Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before proceeding with earnings projections and valuation of SCZMF, it is important to clarify that all numbers of EPS and price targets are calculated on a total of 365,384,489 common shares issued and outstanding. This clarification is necessary since the company <a href=\"https://santacruzsilver.com/santacruz-silver-announces-intention-to-list-on-the-nasdaq-and-provides-details-for-upcoming-annual-general-special-meeting/#:~:text=In%20connection%20with%20the%20proposed,%28the%20%E2%80%9CConsolidation%E2%80%9D%29.\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://santacruzsilver.com/santacruz-silver-announces-intention-to-list-on-the-nasdaq-and-provides-details-for-upcoming-annual-general-special-meeting/#:~:text=In%20connection%20with%20the%20proposed,%28the%20%E2%80%9CConsolidation%E2%80%9D%29.\" target=\"_blank\">recently announced</a> its intent to get listed on the NASDAQ, which would involve either a consolidation of shares up to 10:1, with 4:1 being the more probable figure according to management.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To project earnings, I have to assume certain commodity prices, which are notoriously unpredictable. Due to the above factors, I anticipate silver to average $52 USD/oz in 2026, in line with <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/gold-price-prediction-silver-rate-outlook-for-2026-will-gold-rate-fall-next-year-experts-predict-here/articleshow/124849391.cms?from=mdr\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/gold-price-prediction-silver-rate-outlook-for-2026-will-gold-rate-fall-next-year-experts-predict-here/articleshow/124849391.cms?from=mdr\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a>.

EBITDA for the period was calculated by marginally lowering AISC due to the high CapEx sustained in Zimapan in the first half of the year, which I expect to normalize in the second half. In Q4, however, I expect a significant improvement with the increase in commodity prices, ore from Level 960 comprising an increase in the proportion of Zimapan's ore milled, and production from Bolivar coming back on track, which will be of a higher silver head grade and slightly reduced AISC. Due to these considerations, I estimate EBITDA/net income/EPS for Q4 2025 to be $61.14 million/$42.6 million/$0.12. I have assumed silver prices to average $52/oz in 2026, which is relatively modest compared to some bullish forecasts. This 47% increase in the price of silver from 2025 will have an immense effect on profitability, with projected EBITDA and net income for 2026 growing by 113% and 177%, respectively.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617734878107522_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"856\" data-height=\"562\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617734878107522_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Projections for Q3, Q4, 2025 and 2026 Earnings of SCZMF\" width=\"640\" height=\"420\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"420\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617734878107522_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617734878107522_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617734878107522_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617734878107522_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617734878107522_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617734878107522_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617734878107522_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617734878107522_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Projections for Q3, Q4, 2025 and 2026 Earnings <span>(Projections; Data for Head Grades and Recoveries taken from Company Interim Reports)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conducting a sensitivity analysis for bull, bear, and base case scenarios, here are the projected EPS figures for 2026:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-1761732595986264_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1182\" data-height=\"202\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-1761732595986264_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SCZMF EBITDA, Net Income and EPS in Bull, Bear and Base case scenarios for the spread of Silver Prices and AISC\" width=\"640\" height=\"109\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-1761732595986264_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-1761732595986264_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-1761732595986264_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-1761732595986264_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-1761732595986264_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-1761732595986264_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-1761732595986264_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-1761732595986264_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EBITDA, Net Income and EPS in Bull, Bear and Base case scenarios for the spread of Silver Prices and AISC <span>(AgEq Projections and 2026 Estimates)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Coming to the valuation of SCZMF, it is currently undervalued from the perspective of TTM EV/EBITDA, and 1-year forward EV/EBITDA; the company is currently valued at 3.16 and 1.48, respectively. It is evident that the market is pricing in a major discount due to the risk associated with the business. However, I expect this to adjust slightly upwards once strong earnings are released for Q4 2025, as anticipated by me. My target for EV/EBITDA for the year-end of 2026 is 3.3. This is extremely conservative but takes into account risks associated with currency, silver as a commodity, and assumptions of the mines' operations running smoothly. Along with this, peers sharing similar jurisdiction risk, such as Fortuna Mining Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FSM\" title=\"Fortuna Mining Corp.\">FSM</a>) and Hochschild Mining plc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HCHDF\" title=\"Hochschild Mining plc\">OTCQX:HCHDF</a>) have higher TTM EV/EBITDA multiples of 4.2 and 6, respectively (sourced from Seeking Alpha). The discount as compared to HCHDF seems justified due to shorter mine lives of SCZMF. Another peer SCZMF can be compared to is Silvercorp Metals Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SVM\" title=\"Silvercorp Metals Inc.\">SVM</a>), which trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 9. This can be justified due to SVM operating in China, causing a difference in jurisdiction risk and shorter mine lives of SCZMF. With these assumptions, the target price from an EV/EBITDA multiple of 3.3 comes out to $3.36.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I also evaluated SCZMF on the basis of the NAV by calculating the NAV of each operational mining project on the basis of proven and probable mineral reserves of currently operational mines. The current value of market cap/NAV is 0.43. The NAV calculation excludes the Soracaya Project and the cash generated by the non-SCZMF ore processed by the San Lucas Group from independent miners. This includes a major assumption that the Zimapan mine would have reserves to last 8 years of mining, as its mineral reserves are not supported currently by any viability study.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617722783694348_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1708\" data-height=\"936\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617722783694348_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NAV Calculation to find current NAV/Market Cap of SCZMF\" width=\"640\" height=\"351\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"351\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617722783694348_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617722783694348_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617722783694348_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617722783694348_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617722783694348_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617722783694348_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617722783694348_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/61356945-17617722783694348_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">NAV Calculation to find current NAV/Market Cap <span>(Personal Analysis; Data for Probable and Proven Mining Reserves taken from Company Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A market cap/NAV of 0.43 cannot be justified, even accounting for the usual discount on smaller mining companies in geographies like Latin America. Including the Soracaya Project, this number would be even lower. The current obligations of all mining resources would be paid off by November, ensuring more of the mines' earnings go towards increasing cash, which can then be used to acquire more mines to further increase the scale of operations of SCZMF. Due to this, I feel that a 0.75 market cap/NAV ratio is justified to value the company, which would put its immediate share price at $2.48/share. The huge gap between both valuation methods can be explained by the fact that the Caballo Blanco Group, Bolivar, and Porco mines' proven and probable reserves are quite low and would only last the company a few more years. However, the cash generated from these mines can be put to use in acquiring mines with a higher NAV, which can replace these mines once their reserves are exhausted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using equal weights for both valuation methods, I have come up with a target share price of $2.77 for the end of 2026 (~$11.08 considering a 4:1 consolidation). This implies an upside of 92%, due to which I give SCZMF a buy rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Risks To The Thesis</span></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The entire case for being long SCZMF is heavily reliant on silver prices, and any major drop in these prices that is sustained for a long period would mean that SCZMF would not benefit from the disproportionate effects of a rise in silver prices. However, short-term volatility is inevitable considering the uncertain state of global trade currently due to tariffs levied by the US. This risk can be quantified by a scenario in which silver averages only $35 for 2026, in which case EPS projections would drop from $0.73 to $0.34, a 53% drop.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The management of SCZMF has <a href=\"https://wp-santacruzsilver-2023.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/2025/08/2025_Q2_MDA_Santacruz_Silver_Mining.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://wp-santacruzsilver-2023.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/2025/08/2025_Q2_MDA_Santacruz_Silver_Mining.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">disclosed</a>,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>Production at the Zimapan Mine is not supported by a feasibility study on mineral reserves demonstrating economic or technical viability or any other independent economic study under NI 43-101. Accordingly, there is increased uncertainty and higher economic and technical risks of failure associated with production operations at the Zimapan Mine.</p> <p>Source: Q2 2025 MD&amp;A Interim Report (Page 18)</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Accordingly, it is highly critical for the company that Zimapan stays operational, as any operational or technical failure would have a significantly negative impact on SCZMF's revenue. Beyond just Zimapan, it is important for operations to go smoothly for the valuations and earnings projections to be met. Any disruption, such as the Bolivar mine flooding this year, would have a negative impact on the ore processed by SCZMF. The thesis playing out is highly reliant on smooth operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another major risk to the thesis is any currency headwinds, for example, the recent appreciation of the MXN with respect to the USD. Any such significant appreciation of MXN or BOB would increase AISC, decreasing margins and adversely affecting profitability for SCZMF.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is also important to keep track of zinc, as a significant proportion of SCZMF's revenue comes from it. Any drop in zinc prices would have a negative impact on zinc's contribution to AgEq/oz sold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since SCZMF has a small market cap, investors may face issues of illiquidity at times, which is a major risk to consider.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To conclude, SCZMF currently seems to be an attractive investment option, with 92% upside. The company is positioned well to capitalize on the ongoing silver upcycle by increasing production. Though there are significant risks associated with the company, strong projected earnings growth and undervaluation make it a Buy.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Despite the common stock trading at a premium for many years, and now at a discount, and all the risks, we assume that the bond's yield is enough to compensate for them, because overall we will earn a return.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Company Overview</strong></h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Total assets: around $1.52 billion</li> <li>Current market capitalization: close to $867 million</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615726575312223_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1481\" data-height=\"940\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615726575312223_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ECC's overview\" width=\"640\" height=\"406\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615726575312223_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615726575312223_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615726575312223_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615726575312223_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615726575312223_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615726575312223_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615726575312223_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615726575312223_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ECC's overview <span>(eaglepointcreditcompany.com)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Nominal value of exchange-traded bonds: $285.5 million</li> <li>Nominal value of preferred shares: $116.45 million</li> <li>Credit quality:</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The credit quality of ECC's underlying CLO debt is around a B score:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615731184471865_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"688\" data-height=\"639\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615731184471865_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ECC's credit quality\" width=\"640\" height=\"594\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615731184471865_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615731184471865_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615731184471865_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615731184471865_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615731184471865_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615731184471865_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615731184471865_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/30934865-17615731184471865_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ECC's credit quality <span>(cefdata.com)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This might be quite misleading to some readers, as it suggests that ECC's underlying holdings are B-rated, which is not the case.

Here is a quote from the prospectus of ECCV:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>\"We are required under current law to have an asset coverage of at least 300%, as measured at the time of borrowing and calculated as the ratio of our total assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) over the aggregate amount of our outstanding senior securities representing indebtedness. With respect to senior securities that are stocks (i.e., shares of our Preferred Stock), we are required under current law to have an asset coverage of at least 200%, as measured at the time of the issuance of any such shares of preferred stock and calculated as the ratio of our total assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) over the aggregate amount of our outstanding senior securities representing indebtedness plus the aggregate liquidation preference of any outstanding shares of preferred stock.\"</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We are facing a lot of questions about yield calculations, and we calculate them using the XIRR function in Google Sheets, which is supposed to be the most precise way when dealing with ex-dividend dates. It is a bit more work than just finding a random bond yield calculator, but at least we try to ensure the data is accurate.

Since then, Shake Shack has seen a ~20% correction, while its metrics have only improved: showcasing accelerating comp sales and superb cost management when most of the rest of the industry has faced declining comp sales and a surge in pressure from labor costs and food inflation. I'm biting the bullet here and upgrading Shake Shack to a <strong>buy </strong>rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, there are now many reasons to be positive on Shake Shack. The core tenets of the bull case for this company are:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Category leader with a reputation for quality. </strong>Shake Shack's roots trace back to Michelin-starred chef Danny Meyer, and the company has since earned a reputation as a gourmet burger at a fast-casual price. The company has a massive white space for expansion in the U.S. I also think that while rivals like McDonald's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD\" title=\"McDonald's Corporation\">MCD</a>) are trying to win back traffic by focusing on price, Shake Shack has an opportunity to distinguish itself for quality.</li> <li> <strong>Licensing deals and overseas growth position Shake Shack for tremendous expansion beyond the core domestic market. </strong>The Shake Shack brand is beloved in the U.S., and the company is beginning to capitalize on this by expanding into franchise deals overseas. Licensing revenue is growing at a &gt;20% y/y clip, nearly double the company average and providing a high-margin revenue stream for the company.</li> <li> <strong>Substantial progress in bringing down labor costs. </strong>Shake Shack is achieving substantial operating margin improvement despite a tough and inflationary economy, in which most of its peers are facing deleverage on labor costs. The company's new labor staffing model has allowed it to shave down significant costs on store labor, padding its earnings growth despite more tepid same-store sales performance. We think more machine-based automation (such as Chipotle's Autocado) could be a further catalyst down the line for the company's back-kitchen processes.</li> <li> <strong>Managing inflating costs well. </strong>Though the price of beef has increased in the double digits, the company notes that it has achieved deflation on other costs, helping the company to reduce the bite of inflation by Q4 of this year.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And while I think it still may be a stretch to call Shake Shack a value stock, I do think that its \"port in the storm\" performance amid a tougher quarter for the rest of the industry, plus its recent downside from August peaks, have positioned the stock well for gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At current share prices near $91, Shake Shack trades at a market cap of $3.90 billion. After we net off the $357.8 million of cash and $247.5 million of debt on Shake Shack's latest balance sheet, the company's resulting <strong>enterprise value is $3.79 billion.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For next year, FY26, Wall Street analysts are expecting Shake Shack to hit $1.65 billion in revenue, or 13% y/y growth. The company notes it is planning to open 55-60 new Shacks next year (15-16% unit growth versus the ~375 stores it will end FY25 with, based on a range of 15-20 openings in Q4). If we conservatively assume the company achieves ~100 bps of y/y adjusted EBITDA margin expansion next year to a 15.7% margin (the company has been improving restaurant-level margins at close to a ~2 point pace in recent quarters), adjusted EBITDA in FY26 would be $259.1 million, or ~21% y/y growth. This positions Shake Shack at a <strong>14.6x EV/FY26 adjusted EBITDA multiple. </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, with proven strong execution amid a tough macro climate, Shake Shack fares quite well from a value/growth perspective against other restaurant peers. Shake Shack is trading in line/below Chipotle, despite the latter's growth challenges and its nearly nonexistent comp sales growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_54184e38844e81806b24fc14fafcb616.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_54184e38844e81806b24fc14fafcb616.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_54184e38844e81806b24fc14fafcb616.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_54184e38844e81806b24fc14fafcb616.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_54184e38844e81806b24fc14fafcb616.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_54184e38844e81806b24fc14fafcb616.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_54184e38844e81806b24fc14fafcb616.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_54184e38844e81806b24fc14fafcb616.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_54184e38844e81806b24fc14fafcb616.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To me, it's time to pick up shares of Shake Shack while it's strengthening its hand against a flailing restaurant industry.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 recap</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's now go through Shake Shack's latest quarterly results in greater detail.

Of course, all eyes are fixed on Shake Shack's comp sales trends. In Q3, Shake Shack surprised industry watchers by achieving a 3-point reaccelerating to 5% comp sales growth. Even more surprising is that traffic rebounded to 1% expansion, after three quarters of negative traffic. We note that comp sales accelerated in all of Shake Shack's domestic markets, while also hitting positive growth in all markets except its home base of New York City.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2026\" data-height=\"760\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shake Shack SSS trends\" width=\"640\" height=\"240\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"240\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shake Shack SSS trends <span>(Shake Shack Q3 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a reminder, comp sales represents sales growth in existing store locations, excluding newly opened or newly closed stores. It decomposes into price growth (from price increases as well as customers' menu mix choices) and traffic (the number of transactions that Shake Shack sells). We note that Shake Shack's core rival in the fast-casual space, Chipotle, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835599-chipotle-challenges-are-ahead-but-the-beatdown-prices-a-lot-in\">also just reported earnings with a much more deflating result of 0.3% comp sales</a> (with traffic still negative, and pricing providing all the uplift).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the company also continues to pull in more revenue from its franchise partners: licensing revenue grew 21% y/y to $14.6 million, or 4% of total sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also applaud Shake Shack for its efficient cost management. The company notes that its standardized labor model has allowed the company to reduce labor costs to 24.9% of revenue, down 310bps y/y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1930\" data-height=\"652\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shake Shack labor costs\" width=\"640\" height=\"216\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"216\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shake Shack labor costs <span>(Shake Shack Q3 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, we have to draw out the comparison to Chipotle here, which saw labor <strong>increase </strong>30 bps y/y to 25.2% of revenue. Shake Shack is getting ahead of rising labor costs by taking every opportunity to slice waste out of its labor model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This efficiency mindset carries over into the company's management of commodities as well. While higher beef costs did contribute to a 110 bps rise in food and paper costs as a percentage of revenue, we are heartened by the fact that Shake Shack's Q4 outlook implies blended food and paper cost inflation to moderate down to low single-digit inflation, from mid single digit inflation in Q3. The company says that it has achieved deflation in many items in its food costs that have helped to take away the sting from mid-teens beef price inflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1810\" data-height=\"610\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shake Shack inflation forecast\" width=\"640\" height=\"216\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"216\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shake Shack inflation forecast <span>(Shake Shack Q3 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shake Shack's restaurant-level profit margins, which is a measure of profitability excluding corporate overhead, rose 26% yen to/y to $81 million, with restaurant margins improving 180 bps y/y to 22.8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1892\" data-height=\"636\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shake Shack restaurant margins\" width=\"640\" height=\"215\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"215\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shake Shack restaurant margins <span>(Shake Shack Q3 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shake Shack's adjusted EBITDA of $54 million also grew 18% y/y, consistent with the company's 3-year financial targets of growing adjusted EBITDA at a ~teens pace.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key takeaways</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I've been on the sidelines and skeptical about Shake Shack since the start of 2025.
