The US, the European Union and Japan eventually forced Beijing to overturn the measures via the World Trade Organisation. The incident spurred Japan’s efforts to reduce its reliance on China. Japan’s dependence on China’s rare earths dropped from around 90% at the time of the incident to around 60% today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This year saw a significant escalation of China’s rare earth restrictions as Beijing used its dominance over the critical materials to pressure the US administration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In April, in response to escalating trade tensions, including US tariffs, Beijing imposed export restrictions on seven rare earths and permanent magnets, with companies needing to secure special licenses to send these materials overseas. The curbs included some heavy rare earths, which are almost exclusively produced by China. This was the first time China has placed rare earth magnets on the export control list.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The global automotive industry was among the sectors <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793763-china-export-restrictions-rare-earths-causes-alarm-automotive-industry\" rel=\"noopener\">significantly affected</a> by China’s export controls on rare earth magnets. Ford Motor temporarily shut a Chicago factory in May after running short of rare earth components. In the European Union, companies also reported several production stoppages.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then, October saw sweeping new restrictions with Beijing outlining plans to expand curbs, including requiring overseas exporters of items that contain even small amounts of certain rare earths sourced from China to have an export license. It also subjected technology and equipment related to rare earths processing and magnets to export controls. These measures will now be suspended for a year. The original restrictions announced in April, targeting seven heavy rare earths, weren’t addressed in the statement following this week's meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The US accounted for 10% of China’s total rare earth exports in 2024, but restrictions have led to a 12% drop in shipments to the US from the first to the third quarter of 2025.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">China total rare earth’s exports volume by region</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"744\" data-height=\"343\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png?io=w640\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"295\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: China General Customs Administration, BNEF, ING Research</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Magnets drive China’s rare earths exports</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"744\" data-height=\"343\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"rare earths china\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"295\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: China’s General Administration of Customs, ING Research</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How will the US boost production of rare earths?</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MP Materials operates the only American rare earths mine – Mountain Pass in California’s Mojave Desert, reopened in 2018, and once the world’s top supplier before production shifted to China. It received a $400 million investment from the Pentagon in July, which helped the company fund a new magnets plant in a deal that came with guaranteed purchases at minimum prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trump is also looking beyond the US for rare earths supplies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earlier this month, the US and Australia agreed to jointly invest in Australian mines and processing projects. Both countries also pledged to protect their domestic markets from “unfair trade practices”, using trade measures like floor prices. Australia ranks fourth in rare earth reserves. Still, most projects are several years away from becoming operational.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The US President has also sealed a series of deals on his Asia trip to secure rare earth supplies, including deals with Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The deal with Japan involves the two sides agreeing to boost the supply and production of rare earths, including plans for coordinated investment and stockpiling of rare earths. Meanwhile, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia all agreed to increase US access to rare earths and export rules that would favour American buyers over Chinese companies. These include promises that they will not block shipments to the US. They would also encourage local processing and investment by non-Chinese firms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These deals mark progress towards more diversified supply chains of rare earths, marking a shift in approach, increasing support and involvement from the state.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rising demand adds urgency</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The rise in demand from EVs, renewable energy, and defence adds urgency to the market. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects strong growth in rare earth demand driven by clean energy technologies. EVs are expected to lead, with a compound annual growth rate of 17.2% from 2024 to 2030, followed by wind turbines at 7.5%. Overall, rare earth demand is forecast to grow at 5.1% annually during this period. Other end uses include defence, mobile phones, displays, medical imaging, speakers, headphones, control rods in nuclear reactors and catalysts.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rare earth demand is rising</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"744\" data-height=\"343\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"rare earth demand\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"295\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: IEA, ING Research</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Loosening China’s grip on rare earths won’t be easy</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The deal between Trump and Xi should not give policymakers a false sense of security. Instead, it must serve as a reminder that the United States urgently needs to accelerate efforts to build a supply chain for critical minerals and magnets that does not depend on China. Beijing’s dominance means it can tighten export restrictions at any time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the near term, China will likely maintain its edge, thanks to technical expertise, low costs, and an extensive supply network. But rare earth supply chains must diversify. International cooperation and investment are essential first steps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Breaking Beijing’s grip on rare earths will be slow and expensive, but the payoff is strategic independence. Export controls that give China leverage today will ultimately spur global efforts to develop non-Chinese supply chains. The more the world invests in onshoring and alternative suppliers, the less control China will wield in the long run.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

After an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833039-molina-healthcare-looks-like-a-sick-puppy\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833039-molina-healthcare-looks-like-a-sick-puppy\" target=\"_blank\">increase in the MCR from competitor Molina Healthcare</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MOH\" title=\"Molina Healthcare, Inc.\">MOH</a>), this was encouraging.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, guidance was raised, with adjusted EPS guidance increased from $16 to $16.25, up about 1.5% from the Q2 guidance. Again, it's important to remember that UNH first withdrew guidance, then dramatically reduced their 2025 guidance. A nominal raise like this seems to me to be more of a sweetener for investors than a material upgrade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The earnings have been well covered by S.A. authors, with an overwhelming 'Buy' bias.

The assumption is that rates can be increased enough to restore historical margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I was hoping that United, as the market leader, would provide details of the pricing adjustments for 2026 that they have been able to achieve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There was a fair amount of discussion on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834045-unitedhealth-group-incorporated-unh-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834045-unitedhealth-group-incorporated-unh-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">the earnings call</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management discussed the process of rate increases segment by segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Medicare Advantage - cost inflation is trending at 7.5%, and is expected to trend to 10% in 2026. Other Medicare segments are viewed consistently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Commercial Insurance repricing is around 60% complete for 2026. Margins are expected to recover through 2026 with a return to historical margins only in 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ACA markets are more challenging. Rate re-filings are reported to exceed 25%, however these seem not to be broadly accepted by the states. In response, the company expects to reduce ACA membership by 2/3 of current levels, a massive market share reduction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Medicaid was left until last. Here only half of the rates to be effective January 1st have been agreed. Half remain open. United expects 2025 to be broadly breakeven for Medicaid, and 2026 to be negative by around 1.5%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of margin outlook, for the risk business, the target remains a return to 7-9% margins. However, expectations are that 2026 will miss the bottom end of that range by 1.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, a rational approach to setting medical cost inflation trends. The expectation however is for cost trends to increase up to 10% year on year, up from around 7.5%. That's a rapid pace of change with increasing momentum. I see a material risk that the trend could continue to accelerate, and the 10% undershoots. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Secondly, a big driver has been benefit utilisation levels. Management provided little insight into expectations here. My concern is that significant increases in pricing will drive away healthier members, who submit fewer claims, leaving the residual risk pool overweighted to the 'frequent flyers' who use benefits more. An increase in net utilisation levels could result in further pressure on the MCR even if rates can rise faster than medical inflation trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thirdly, pricing. Other than quoting a big number of 25% increases in rate <strong>re-filings </strong>there was little data available of the actual level of rate increases being achieved in the segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see a material risk to the margin expectations for 2026. The outlook for 2027 and beyond indicated reversion to historical margins, but any margin under-performance in 2026 is likely to flow into the outer years.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Optum</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Optum Health is undergoing a massive turnaround in the Value Based Care segment. Optum Rx CEO Patrick Conway was pretty straightforward in outlining the mistakes made here, which are all related to growing too aggressively. This stretched across the provider network and the product range offered, and the rapid growth created operational and integration issues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conway described a significant repositioning here, with a reduction of the partnership footprint to seek restored profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The application of a new risk scoring and payment regulatory mechanism called v28 caused significant margin erosion, and Optum is having to renegotiate partner contracts to mitigate this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The targets for margin improvement are significant. Current margins are expected to be under 3%, pulled down by value based care margins of less than 1%. Medicare funding cuts are identified as a headwind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The long term margin targets for the business are for margins to improve to 6-8%</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similarly, the fee based Optum business has been underperforming, and significant work is being done here to turn the business around.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A bright spot is in Optum Insights, where AI applications are hoped to generate significant future revenue streams and profitable growth. The company continues to invest here, but there were few concrete details of progress.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, Optum Rx, the PBM, has been performing well, with solid margins and growth. No mention was made of the<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doj-expands-probe-into-unitedhealths-prescription-management-services-bloomberg-2025-08-26/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doj-expands-probe-into-unitedhealths-prescription-management-services-bloomberg-2025-08-26/\" target=\"_blank\"> DOJ probe into Optum Rx billing</a> practices, which I found disappointing. This could have the potential to create headwinds for Optum Rx if the findings are negative, or create the need for changes in the operating model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The PBM sector has been the subject of criticism from the current administration, with President Trump referring to the sector as, \"The horrible middleman that makes more money, frankly, than the drug companies, and they don't do anything except they're a middleman,\" <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/insurer-stocks-fall-after-trump-says-were-going-knock-out-middleman-2024-12-16/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/insurer-stocks-fall-after-trump-says-were-going-knock-out-middleman-2024-12-16/\" target=\"_blank\">as reported by Reuters</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As <a href=\"https://pharmaphorum.com/news/pbm-reform-looms-end-year-us-legislation-package\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://pharmaphorum.com/news/pbm-reform-looms-end-year-us-legislation-package\" target=\"_blank\">this article from 'pharmaforum' discusses</a>, legislation targeting PBM margins is included in the upcoming legislative docket, drawing strong lobbying efforts from the PBM industry. The legislation seeks to squeeze margins by changing the rules on 'spread pricing' whereby PBMs add margins on drug costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are just a couple of examples of the pressure currently facing PBMs. However, there seems to be little discussion or awareness of the risk to growth and margins in the PBM sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, in one way or another, most of the segments of Optum are either managing turnarounds, or facing risks.

I rate UNH as a Hold.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my own portfolio, I took a long position around $300, hedging by selling OTM calls. My shares were called away for $330, for a total return of around 25% including call premiums. I am now short Nov 11th $320 puts. </p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a></span>) shares fell nearly 4% in extended trading after the company disclosed record capital expenditure of $35 billion in its fiscal first quarter, well above Wall Street expectations. Management warned that spending<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> would stay elevated through the year as it expands AI and cloud infrastructure.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the move underscores Microsoft’s long-term ambition to dominate artificial intelligence, investors reacted cautiously to the near-term cost pressure, highlighting the delicate balance between growth and profitability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Technical setup signals pause after major rally</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The daily chart shows Microsoft consolidating after a sharp rally earlier this year that pushed shares to $554.83. The stock has now retraced toward the $541 zone, coinciding with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement and immediate resistance-turned-support. The 20-day EMA at $522.57 and 50-day EMA at $515.12 sit just below current levels, forming critical near-term floors. A decisive break under this cluster could expose the 100-day EMA at $500.47, while the 200-day EMA at $475.20 anchors the broader uptrend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1386\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"866\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Microsoft stock price dynamics (Source: TradingView)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Price action remains within a rising channel structure, signaling that the long-term bullish pattern of higher highs and higher lows is intact. However, momentum indicators show early signs of fatigue. The RSI is hovering at 72, suggesting overbought conditions that often precede consolidation phases. Unless the stock reclaims $555 resistance and sustains above it, the probability of further sideways action or a mild pullback remains high.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Azure strength steadies investor confidence</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the headline spending shock, Azure cloud performance delivered an upside surprise. The division grew 40% year-over-year in the July–September quarter, beating estimates of 38.4%. The company guided for 37% growth in the current quarter, signaling sustained demand. CFO Amy Hood emphasized that capacity limitations had capped stronger growth, implying the elevated capital expenditure is aimed at eliminating those bottlenecks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The spending surge mirrors a broader pattern across Big Tech as firms race to expand AI infrastructure. Alphabet and Meta also warned of rising costs tied to data center buildouts and AI deployment. While these investments strengthen long-term competitive positions, they are likely to pressure margins through the near term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue guidance between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion for the current quarter met expectations, maintaining confidence in Microsoft’s ability to generate consistent top-line growth. Analysts note that the company’s diverse business lines — spanning Azure, Office 365, and gaming — continue to provide stability despite increased capital intensity.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook: Balancing cost and cloud growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For investors, the trade-off is clear: accept near-term margin compression in exchange for leadership in AI infrastructure. The chart structure suggests consolidation, with $515–$522 as the zone to watch for trend confirmation. Holding above this range keeps bullish bias intact, while a slip toward $500 could shift momentum defensively. On the upside, reclaiming $555 opens the door to a retest of the 1.618 Fibonacci extension near $593.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As previously discussed, Microsoft’s long-term thesis remains tied to its cloud and AI dominance. The short-term pressure on margins may weigh on sentiment, but as Azure growth accelerates and new AI tools gain traction, the <a href=\"https://tradersunion.com/news/financial-news/show/752700-microsoft-climbs-to-542/\" rel=\"nofollow\">company’s ability to balance cost discipline with innovation</a> will determine whether the recent pullback evolves into a buying opportunity or signals a deeper correction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>This material may contain third-party opinions; none of the data and information on this webpage constitutes investment advice according to our <a href=\"https://tradersunion.com/terms-of-use/#p10\" rel=\"nofollow\">Disclaimer</a>.

It’s major subsidiary, Lollicup USA Inc is a specialty distributor and manufacturer of single use disposable products mainly for the restaurant and foodservices industry. There are<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> several ‘sub-categories’ which encompass a wide range of products and services.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Karat is the major brand, and it provides high quality disposable food packaging, containers, tableware, cups, lids, cutlery, and straws.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Karat Earth takes Karat to the next level by focusing on eco-friendly products, allowing customers who are environmentally conscious to buy and use sustainable and recyclable or compostable products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tea Zone delivers premium tea and syrup solutions to the bubble tea industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Total Clean offers a full range of janitorial products as well as general and warehouse supplies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Why now</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A couple of years ago the company pivoted to a more asset light model which saw the majority of revenue shift from manufacturing to distribution. Low freight costs and competitively priced products were a great offset against high local costs (particularly labor).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Local Manufacturing then dropped from roughly 20% of sales to 11% currently, however they have maintained select US manufacturing capability to enable agility &amp; flexibility and to help with short lead times and urgent orders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As per a recent <a href=\"https://irkarat.com/download/krt-ir-presentation-september-2025/?wpdmdl=8935&amp;refresh=68ed11983b8851760367000\" rel=\"nofollow\">presentation in September 2025</a> ecofriendly products have risen to 33.6% of sales in 2024. This is the niche which the company is choosing to focus on, and I’d expect a lot of effort to be directed to these lines of business going forward. Tariffs have had a relatively benign impact on the business as their products are sourced from lower Tariff countries like <a href=\"https://www.theglobalstatistics.com/taiwan-tariffs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Taiwan</a> (tariff 10%) and <a href=\"https://www.theglobalstatistics.com/vietnam-tariffs-on-us-goods/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vietnam</a> (tariff 20%) with ‘just’ 10% of sourcing from China at the time of writing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616717275138972.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" width=\"576\" height=\"291\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"576\" data-height=\"291\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616717275138972.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616717275138972.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616717275138972.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616717275138972.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616717275138972.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616717275138972.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616717275138972.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616717275138972.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Global sourcing concentration <span>(Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This niche has some major tailwinds going for it, firstly Government is proposing via the <a href=\"https://www.recyclingtoday.com/news/senators-introduce-farewell-to-foam-act-expanded-polystyrene/\" rel=\"nofollow\">‘farewell to foam act’</a> to ban the use of Styrofoam on a phase out basis by 2028. (<a href=\"https://www.packagingdive.com/news/tracker-packaging-state-policy-epr-pcr-pfas-recyclability/647362/?policy-area=foam\" rel=\"nofollow\">11 states have pre-empted this by already issuing bans</a>). Another tailwind is the ongoing ESG drive by both corporates and consumers as ‘doing the right thing’ and a drive to a better, healthier more sustainable ‘lifestyle’ becomes more common place globally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.towardspackaging.com/insights/us-sustainable-packaging-market-sizing\" rel=\"nofollow\">According to ‘Towards Packaging’</a> the size of the sustainable packaging market is set to reach $73.81bn by 2034 in the USA, growing at a rate of 4.15% per annum with food and beverage expected to consume the largest share of the spend (41.4%). <a href=\"https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/press-releases/food-service-disposable-market\" rel=\"nofollow\">Polaris research</a> see the global food service disposables market growing at 4.6% annually to reach a value of $98.5bn by 2034.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Eco conscious consumers are choosing to support companies and brands which focus on this and its creating customer loyalty. A brand's product packaging is a competitive advantage too, it’s functional, key to maintaining freshness and appearance &amp; it’s a potential differentiator in a competitive market. The packaging itself can of course also be used for advertising and promotion. Some great companies are already using their products in the US FMCG space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616719722360666.png?io=w640\" alt=\"picture\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"521\" height=\"320\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616719722360666.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616719722360666.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616719722360666.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616719722360666.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616719722360666.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616719722360666.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616719722360666.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616719722360666.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Current FMCG clients <span>(Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Current FMCG clients <span>(Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The customer base has broadened too. ‘Pure’ distribution allows the company to serve national and regional peers.

These now account for 17% of Net Sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Flavors and syrups for the bubble tea market make up the balance at 4.9% of Net Sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This broad and diverse cohort of customers in varying industries has helped reduce concentration risk and now no single client accounts for more than 10% of revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Covid provided a boom for the industry with growth of around 40% in sales over the 2020-2022 period. Since then, however, it’s been fairly stagnant as pull forward demand has been absorbed by a normalized market, however I think we’re poised to see growth start picking up again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Being ‘on trend’ with the shift to clean and green, a new opportunity has opened up for the company and they have developed an important niche as a scaled leading player in the eco-friendly foodservice packaging space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By avoiding mass commodity supply and focusing on high mix, fast turnaround, branded and specialty packaging instead the company has managed to grind out ever better margins and earnings and even better they have gone from being cash flow negative as recently as 2021 to generating around $50m in free cash flow over the last 12 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another compelling point in my view is the fact that <a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/KRT/holders/\" rel=\"nofollow\">insiders own a massive amount of stock,</a> in fact over 57% of the company sits with the founders and other staff. This is true alignment in my book. There is an incentive to grow the business over time, to keep paying a hefty dividend and to ensure that wealth is protected. As shareholders, I’d like to think that our interests would be aligned with those of the founders who in turn would manage their (and our wealth) with care and integrity. On top of this both founders earn very modest salaries and no additional stock options as part of their compensation structure. This probably explains why such a large dividend is paid and is certainly further incentive to increase profits to increase the company’s value and future dividend pay outs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Packaging has always been fiercely competitive with a slew of companies fighting for share in what is generally a slow-growing low-margin market. This is why it’s important to try and disrupt or shake the market up if you’re small and up and coming. By using new technologies and being nimble smaller players can pivot quickly to changing circumstances and market dynamics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is where the eco-friendly, higher margin, niche stands to shine. These products made up about a third of net sales last year and the company sees further room for expansion and growth. This is primarily because of two levers, firstly a small starting base and secondly as alluded to above, government mandates that propose to ban certain materials that have been commonly used in the past. The company aims to fill gaps in product lines to get restaurant and food service customers what they need, quickly and efficiently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">No matter who you consider as a competitor KRT is small. With Revenue of $ 422.6m in 2024 and a market cap of $ 500m this is not a large company. However, therein lies the opportunity in my view. Karat is still ‘young’ with a lot of growth potential ahead of it, here’s my thinking:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consensus forecasts through 2027 are calling for Revenue growth of roughly 8% per annum with EPS growth of 12%. Against market growth of 4% this is telling me they’re slowly gaining share and with sales of $422m (in a market forecast to be worth around $74bn in 2034) there is a lot of share to be had. Just a 1% market share implies sales of $740m and 75% growth from here for example.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>VALUATION</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at it from a DCF perspective. Extrapolating 12% earnings growth over the next three years (these are consensus numbers) and then dropping them down to 4% after that to line the company up with market growth of 4.15% (the Towards Packaging figure above) would imply that they gain a small amount of market share up until 2027 and then stagnate after that. Using the average return of the S&amp;P500 over the long term (10%) as the discount rate, we get a fair value of $31.90.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616724946007597.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" width=\"559\" height=\"229\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"559\" data-height=\"229\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616724946007597.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616724946007597.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616724946007597.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616724946007597.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616724946007597.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616724946007597.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616724946007597.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616724946007597.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

Compared to a current share price of $24.59 this would imply upside up to $31.00 or 26%. With a current dividend yield of 7.3% your total return potential could be in the 30's.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>RISKS</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As with any investment there are always risks to consider. Over and above the normal market and economic risk that any company faces daily, one also needs to consider the fact that this is a small company, it competes in a low moat, low cost and very competitive industry. The restaurant industry in particular is cut throat and cost conscious. Packaging is a commodity and unless you can demonstrate real value add, lowest price wins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Large founder skin in the game is always a big positive in my world, however in this instance the ownership structure is arguably more complex than it needs to be. There are also several related party transactions that could make some potential investors uncomfortable. For example, the CEO’s brother owns one of the companies’ overseas suppliers and roughly 13% of products sold came from this company. <a href=\"https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=103398&amp;ref=318164706&amp;type=HTML&amp;symbol=KRT&amp;cdn=404900988e3420650206b3ad201fbbcb&amp;companyName=Karat+Packaging+Inc.&amp;formType=10-K&amp;formDescription=Annual+report+pursuant+to+Section+13+or+15%28d%29&amp;dateFiled=2024-03-15#i5c1df8fc06cf4cb8bdaa9b0ee5d4e94b_181\" rel=\"nofollow\">(page 68, point 17 of the 10-k</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the dividend, last year they paid more than they earned with the difference supported by free cash flow. This is unsustainable and not what I like to see. Slow or no dividend growth is therefore possible going forward as they grow into the dividend. I see a lower dividend as unlikely unless forced as founder compensation is closely tied to it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sometimes solid investment opportunities come in different guises. Most of us look for glamourous industries and companies where most of the buzz is. Today for example its things like AI, reshoring and energy transition with others like obesity drugs and crypto still up there and top of mind for many.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But what if you took a few steps to the left or right of these themes and looked for companies that help facilitate these trends and provide solutions for customers at the same time? Oftentimes those sweet spots are ignored or not even considered because they’re so ‘unromantic’ or not in vogue. Rarely for example will you see a social media influencer touting the need for a good plumber or high-quality toilet paper. Nobody cares until you need it right!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion Karat packaging fits into this mold. It provides essential and needed products to its customers and its customers’ customers, helping them meet their needs in a green and eco friendly manner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I bet you’ve never really thought about how your takeaway meal is packaged or presented to you. As long as it arrives on time and looks appealing you’re happy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We all (myself included) take for granted the ‘other’ things that restaurants of all sizes provide whether you eat in or take out. Napkins, straws, take out containers, cups and even cutlery are items that are just ‘there’ yet without them our meal experience would just not be the same.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Being ‘on trend’ with the shift to clean and green, a new opportunity has opened up for the company and they have developed an important niche as a leading player in the eco-friendly foodservice packaging space which I think deserves an investment.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With potential returns in the 30% range, this stock is finding a place in my growth portfolio with a modest allocation to begin with. I rate Karat Packaging (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KRT\" title=\"Karat Packaging Inc.\">KRT</a>) as a Buy for more risk tolerant investors.</p>",

What is more, while the ETF invests in some 653 individual companies, exposure to the top two holdings alone accounts for 21.16% of ETF assets:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1282\" data-height=\"628\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Ten largest individual holdings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"314\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Ten largest individual holdings <span>(iShares website (accessed October 2025))</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, investors looking to save on fees may consider the rationale of investing directly in the two largest holdings - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>) and Samsung Electronics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\" target=\"_blank\">OTCPK:SSNLF</a>).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I estimate EMXC holdings currently trade at 18.45x their trailing P/E multiple, or an earnings yield of about 5.42%. Given the elevated information technology allocation, I view EMXC as quite comparable to the S&amp;P 500, notwithstanding a smaller financial sector allocation in the leading U.S. benchmark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I calculate that the S&amp;P 500 currently trades at <a href=\"https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy\" target=\"_blank\">29.1x its trailing earnings</a>, or an earnings yield of 3.44%. Hence we can say that the current valuation suggests that S&amp;P 500 earnings would have to grow almost 2% faster in perpetuity just to make up for higher starting valuations relative to EMXC, something I see as unsustainable over the long term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">GDP Growth Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While GDP growth is an imperfect proxy for earnings growth, for ETFs with a diverse country allocation I find GDP growth to be a good starting point when evaluating future earnings growth prospects. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the table below, I have estimated the country-weighted EMXC GDP growth outlook for 2026 using the IMF's <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/10/14/world-economic-outlook-october-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/10/14/world-economic-outlook-october-2025\" target=\"_blank\">October 2025 World Economic Outlook</a>:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td>Country</td> <td>Weight</td> <td>GDP growth 2026</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Taiwan</td> <td>28.76%</td> <td>2.1%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>India</td> <td>21.77%</td> <td>6.2%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>South Korea</td> <td>17.32%</td> <td>1.8%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Brazil</td> <td>5.84%</td> <td>1.9%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>South Africa</td> <td>4.83%</td> <td>1.2%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Saudi Arabia</td> <td>4.50%</td> <td>4%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mexico</td> <td>2.70%</td> <td>1.5%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>United Arab Emirates</td> <td>2.07%</td> <td>5%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Malaysia</td> <td>1.61%</td> <td>4%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Indonesia</td> <td>1.57%</td> <td>4.9%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Poland</td> <td>1.48%</td> <td>3.1%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Thailand</td> <td>1.44%</td> <td>1.6%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Other/cash</td> <td>6.13%</td> <td>Not relevant</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Total</strong></td> <td><strong>100%</strong></td> <td><strong>3.16%</strong></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: Author calculations</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My calculations show that country-weighted GDP growth for EMXC should amount to about 3.16% in 2026, with the ETF benefiting from its large allocation to India which is forecast to deliver GDP growth of 6.2% next year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The IMF projects U.S. GDP growth at 2.1% next year, roughly 1% below my weighted average estimate for EMXC. As such, while it is always possible that earnings growth deviates somewhat from GDP growth, I think that EMXC will deliver earnings growth at least on par, if not better, than the S&amp;P 500.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Appeal</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EMXC offers a current dividend yield of 2.36%, indicating a payout ratio of about 0.48 when we factor in the ETF's expense ratio of 0.25%. As such, I view the current dividend as sustainable, with my estimates showing that dividends should increase by 7-8% in 2026, marginally below the 9.88% annual increase over the past three years:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618172524630544.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EMXC dividend grade\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"475\" height=\"256\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618172524630544.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618172524630544.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618172524630544.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618172524630544.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618172524630544.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618172524630544.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618172524630544.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618172524630544.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EMXC dividend grade <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My dividend growth outlook is driven by retained earnings, solid GDP growth, and inflation somewhat above 2% in emerging markets. Amid ongoing Fed rate cuts, I view EMXC as an ideal ETF for investors focused on dividend growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">EMXC Rating</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even after the strong year-to-date outperformance, EMXC holdings offer a trailing earnings yield some 2% higher than the S&amp;P 500. GDP growth projections for 2026 remain favorable, with EMXC countries likely to deliver GDP growth roughly 1% stronger than the United States.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As discussed in the <em>Dividend Appeal</em> section, the ETF also offers a dividend yield that is double that of the cheapest S&amp;P 500-tracking options such as the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VOO\" title=\"Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF\">VOO</a>), with VOO currently offering a paltry 1.11% dividend yield. I also believe that EMXC dividend growth will exceed that of the S&amp;P 500 going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, I think that EMXC will continue to outperform the S&amp;P 500 in 2026, ranking the ETF with a Buy rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investing in emerging markets comes with elevated risks compared to the more established U.S. capital market. Firstly, while EMXC is traded in USD, it represents an implicit short USD bet since the ETF invests in companies traded in local currencies such as the Taiwan dollar and Indian rupee. As such, investors not comfortable with currency risk should avoid emerging market ETFs such as EMXC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Secondly, there is no guarantee that strong GDP growth will translate into robust earnings growth for EMXC holdings. For emerging markets, the link between GDP growth and corporate earnings growth may not be as strong, since capital markets are not as developed as those in the United States.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last but certainly not least in terms of importance, with 35.12% of ETF assets allocated to the information technology sector, EMXC is particularly exposed to the risk of AI/automation growth falling short of expectations. Likewise the ETF's 45.11% allocation to cyclical sectors exposes EMXC to losses should GDP growth fall short of expectations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China tariff tensions have been a key point of contention so far in 2025, culminating in the April 2025 market selloff. While recent headlines suggest the risk of a full-blown trade war is receding, the rivalry between the United States and China will likely be a defining feature this century as the two super powers battle for influence in economic affairs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Against this backdrop, investors can mitigate China-related risks and at the same time benefit from superb emerging markets growth by investing in EMXC. The ETF's holdings currently offer an earnings yield some 2% higher than the S&amp;P 500, while GDP growth is likely to be roughly 1% higher than that of the United States.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Coupled with a higher dividend yield and better dividend growth prospects, I believe this should result in continued outperformance of EMXC relative to the S&amp;P 500 in 2026, ranking EMXC a Buy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key risks in the investment case include currency risk, the imperfect link between GDP expansion and earnings growth, and the ETF's outsized exposure to cyclical sectors and the AI/automation growth theme.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thank you for reading.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The RSI remains elevated but not extreme, suggesting momentum is intact though vulnerable to fatigue if fresh catalysts fail to emerge.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings volatility and Fed tone shape sentiment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market’s tone was dominated by post-earnings swings in mega-cap stocks. Microsoft slipped 2% after disclosing a $3.1 billion charge linked to its OpenAI investment, while Meta plunged nearly 9% due to a $15.93 billion expense tied to President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act. In contrast, Alphabet rallied 8% on strong cloud and ad revenue growth, helping offset weakness in other sectors. Eli Lilly added 3.5% after raising full-year guidance, underscoring the continued rotation between growth and defensive names.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks at the post-meeting conference added a layer of caution. While the Fed delivered a 25-basis-point rate cut earlier this week, Powell emphasized that another cut in December was “not a foregone conclusion,” a statement that tempered risk appetite and nudged Treasury yields slightly higher. For equities already priced near record valuations, Powell’s language reinforced that monetary policy may not remain as supportive as markets anticipate.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Macro backdrop offers mild relief</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Geopolitical developments provided a modest tailwind. The Trump–Xi summit concluded with a partial trade truce that included a 10% reduction in U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, bringing the overall rate to 47%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In return, China agreed to curb fentanyl exports and expand purchases of American agricultural goods. While the deal lacked major breakthroughs, it helped ease global risk sentiment by lowering trade-related uncertainty at the margins.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook: Bulls hold control but watch key levels</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The S&amp;P 500 continues to trade within a well-defined bullish structure, though near-term gains may be harder to sustain as earnings and Fed policy expectations collide. Immediate resistance sits at 6,920, followed by the 7,000 level, while key supports remain at 6,740 and 6,620.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As previously discussed, the index’s broader trend remains upward, supported by robust earnings in parts of the tech and healthcare sectors. However, with monetary policy tightening expectations in flux and investor positioning stretched, traders should brace for volatility around upcoming earnings reports and macro data releases. The next few sessions will determine whether the <a href=\"https://tradersunion.com/news/financial-news/show/753432-sp-500-extends-record-run/\" rel=\"nofollow\">S&amp;P 500 can push through to new highs</a> or settle into consolidation before year-end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>This material may contain third-party opinions; none of the data and information on this webpage constitutes investment advice according to our <a href=\"https://tradersunion.com/terms-of-use/#p10\" rel=\"nofollow\">Disclaimer</a>.

Last year, revenues improved by 13%, so this means that Alphabet not only is growing, but it is doing so even faster. This is impressive since this company has a market cap over $3 trillion and it grows like a small-medium cap company. At this point, I really don’t know what the limit is, it might even reach $10-20 trillion over the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Google Search &amp; Other, which was supposed to be obsolete a couple of quarters ago, continue to grow by double digits (+15%) and reached $56.56 billions of revenues. In hindsight, we can definitely affirm that ChatGPT hasn't even scratched the Mountain View giant. Actually, Google Search is growing faster and Gemini reached 650 million monthly active users. The market is gradually understanding that AI is not a threat, but an opportunity to get the best out of every business segment of this company, including Google Search:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p><em>AI is driving an expansionary moment and transforming how people use Google Search. Our investments in new AI experiences, such as AI Overviews and AI Mode, continued to drive growth in overall queries, including commercial queries, creating more opportunities for monetization. These AI experiences are enhancing how people connect with businesses and shop on Search. We recently added shopping capabilities in AI Mode, which now help people shop conversationally in Search, and we expanded try-on capabilities to more clothing items, now available to anyone in the U.S.</em></p> <p><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835072-alphabet-inc-googl-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\"> <em>Philipp Schindler, Senior Vice President &amp; Chief Business Officer of Google</em></a>.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Philipp Schindler described is basically the reason why Alphabet is among the best companies in the world: it constantly evolves to meet the changing needs of its users and it never gets stuck on what worked in the past. Successful long-term investments require a forward-looking approach, something that is embedded in the Google’s vision.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now let’s talk about YouTube, of which revenues reached $10.26 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year. In this case as well, the growth rate accelerated, and during the conference call, Philipp Schindler provided interesting insights about the future of this platform.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>So in other words, on average, a YouTube Music and Premium subscriber generates a meaningful higher gross profit than they were simply an ad-supported users. Fans come from all over the world. You know this and this engagement through ads and subscription generates YouTube's revenues and funds what I started with, these creators here and this then drives more viewership and engagement and so on. And that's the flywheel.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">YouTube initially started with an ad-based business model, but the main goal is making it a subscription-based model. The latter guarantees recurring revenues, regardless the business cycle, and these kinds of businesses tend to be trading at high price multiples. Furthermore, the gross profit on Premium subscribers is way higher than ad-supported users, and this means high profitability. Current paid subscriptions are over 300 million, mainly driven by Google One and YouTube Premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The improvement in profitability is already visible in the operating margin, 42.53% (excluding the $3.50 billion EC fine) compared to 40.30% of Q3 2024. Clearly, besides YouTube Premium, much of this margin expansion has been led by the Google Cloud.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"936\" data-height=\"451\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Alphabet Q3 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"308\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318320974789_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Alphabet Q3 2025</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenues grew by 34%, but operating income has shot up by 85% since it is a highly scalable business. Alphabet will greatly benefit from the operating leverage of this business, and we are still in an early phase. Consider that a mature cloud like AWS can deliver an operating margin of about 40%, almost double than Google Cloud. Currently, Google Cloud makes up less than 10% of total operating income, but its share is bound to get much wider.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p><em>Our complete enterprise AI product portfolio is accelerating growth in revenue, operating margins and backlog. In Q3, customer demand strengthened in 3 ways. One, we are signing new customers faster. The number of new GCP customers increased by nearly 34% year-over-year. Two, we are signing larger deals. We have signed more deals over $1 billion through Q3 this year than we did in the previous 2 years combined. Third, we are deepening our relationships. Over 70% of existing Google Cloud customers use our AI products, including Banco BV, Best Buy and FairPrice Group.</em></p> <p><em>Sundar Pichai, CEO &amp; Director.</em></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When you have a business with such a high growth potential and it might reach an operating income of 40-50% over the long term, no wonder why the company increased CapEx once again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-1761831833063738_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"801\" data-height=\"476\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-1761831833063738_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Alphabet Q3 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"380\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-1761831833063738_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-1761831833063738_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-1761831833063738_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-1761831833063738_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-1761831833063738_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-1761831833063738_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-1761831833063738_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-1761831833063738_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Alphabet Q3 2025</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I am fully satisfied by these Q3 2025 results as Alphabet is becoming a diversified giant. Initially, the whole business relied on Google Search &amp; Other, now we have YouTube Premium and Google Cloud that provide recurring revenues with a high profitability. Plus, they are both growing faster than Google Search.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A matter of valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As previously stated, Alphabet remains my #1 position in my portfolio, but its valuation is getting a bit overextended, that’s the reason behind the hold rating. I wouldn’t sell a single share since I plan to hold this great company for the long term (at least 10 years), but at the same time I wouldn’t buy at the current levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think investors had a pretty long-time span (multiple occasions over the last 3 years) to buy some shares, and now it might be too late to jump on the bandwagon. I understand that fundamentals are improving faster than expected, but at this point I think FOMO is starting to set in. Alphabet was traded at $200 just 2 months ago, most of the year even below that threshold. Now everyone wants Alphabet and it seems cheap at $300 per share. But what kind of growth rate the current valuation is pricing in?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"951\" data-height=\"313\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DCF made by the author\" width=\"640\" height=\"211\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56207090-17618318345899863_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DCF made by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Starting from the TTM free cash flow and considering a RRR of 12%, to justify the $300 per share, the company should deliver a 10Y CAGR of 23.50%. So, this means a $607 billion free cash flow by 2035, and a market cap of $12 trillion if we assume a 20x price multiple. Is it possible? Yes. Is it likely? It might be.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would never bet against Alphabet, but at the same time I would wait a drop before jumping in once again. The expectations are getting pretty high and we know how unpredictable the future is: the current valuation is not pricing in any unexpected event. Of course, I hope I am wrong and my unrealized profits keep spiking up.</p>",

Still, this was not enough to send shares higher. There was a -$0.05 impact from its annual review of actuarial performance in its insurance business, which I would not adjust out, meaning earnings were $9.87 per share, in my view. Still, this was up 22% from last year, when its actuarial review was a $0.73 headwind. Excluding this, operating earnings were up a solid 12%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aided by a stronger market, assets under management (“AUM”) grew by 8% to $1.7 trillion. Additionally, G&amp;A expenses were down 3% from last year, given ongoing efficiency efforts. Ameriprise also has a strong balance sheet. The company maintains $2.2 billion of excess capital, and it has $2.5 billion of holding company liquidity. As a reminder, it is the holding company that repurchases stock and pays the common dividend. As a result, AMP did $687 million of buybacks in the quarter, and it returned 87% of earnings to shareholders. Thanks to buybacks, its share count is down about 4.3% over the past year. AMP also pays a 1.3% dividend yield.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash pressures are manageable</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking deeper into segment results, wealth management is the core of the business, and revenue grew 9% to $3 billion. Earnings were up a more modest 7% to $881 million, weighed down by lower cash earnings. The company is seeing strong AUM growth, primarily thanks to a rising market, as well as due to organic wins. With higher markets and strong sales activity, revenue per advisor rose 10% to $1.09 million. Advisor compensation was up 11%, maintaining advisory fee and commission growth (advisors are paid a share of their production). G&amp;A was up a comparatively modest 5% to $439 million, as the company generates solid operating leverage.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618396287233398.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph of money and a number AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"353\" height=\"462\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618396287233398.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618396287233398.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618396287233398.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618396287233398.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618396287233398.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618396287233398.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618396287233398.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13071522-17618396287233398.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ameriprise</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A key source of profitability for Ameriprise is its cash sweep. Essentially, on cash it custodies in client accounts, it earns net interest revenue, and these earnings are closely tied to the Federal Reserve funds rate. With the Fed having cut interest rates 50bps since September, that will likely pressure cash yields. Still, cash yields are elevated, and with Chairman Jay Powell saying a December rate cut is not a foregone conclusion, I do expect only a moderate cutting cycle. I have been assuming 4-5 cuts over 2025-2026, and this remains my base case. I view this as a manageable headwind, especially given how strong the S&amp;P 500 has been.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net investment income (net of interest expense) was $383 million, down from $391 million last year. AMP has been able to offset much of the headwind from Fed rate cuts by cutting the amount of interest it pays clients. However, because it shares less than 25% of its interest income, cash sweep balances have faced sustained pressure as investors move into higher-yielding products, like money market funds. This pressure has existed for three years, and while I believe we are approaching the end, balances do not appear to have bottomed out just yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash sweep balances were down $400 million from last year at $27.1 billion. This was also down by about $300 million sequentially, a slightly disappointing performance, as Q2 balances are often depressed by tax payments. As such, I was hoping to see stabilization this quarter. I do believe we are nearing a bottom here, and going forward, any pressure on cash sweep revenue is more likely to be tied to further Fed rate cuts than balances.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is also important to note that the wealth management unit is likely to see further benefits from the higher S&amp;P 500. Advisory fees are typically billed in arrears, so Q3 revenue was largely based on where asset levels were on June 30. With the S&amp;P up ~10% over the past few months, that will mechanistically boost revenue in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While fears around the cash sweep have clearly weighed on the stock, it is important to note that this headwind has been less than 1% of EPS. No doubt, lower balances and lower rates reduce AMP’s earnings, all else equal. Ultimately, though, this pressure is one that is likely to slow earnings growth rather than actually cause a decline in earnings power. With further market tailwinds that have not hit results, this cash headwind is entirely manageable.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other units are broadly stable</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Elsewhere, asset management earnings rose 6% to $260 million, and operating margins were a strong 42%. Revenue was up 3% to $906 million, as fees were stable at 46bps. While a rising market lifts AUM, the company (like many traditional asset managers) has struggled with outflows as investors structurally shift towards lower-fee passive products. Outflows were $3.4 billion, with outflows from both retail and institutional clients. Still, this was a dramatic improvement from the $9 billion seen last quarter. Outflows largely offset market appreciation over the past year, with AUM up just 1% to $714 billion. I expect low-to-mid single-digit AUM growth over the medium term, as market appreciation is partially offset by structural outflows, given the ongoing shift to passive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ameriprise also has a comparatively small insurance unit. More than anything, this unit supports its wealth management business, giving its advisors proprietary annuities and insurance products to offer their clients. During the quarter, it earned $200 million; earnings were down about 4% from last year. Sales were strong at $1.4 billion, given ongoing demand for variable annuities in the fairly elevated rate environment. AMP’s insurance unit is extremely well capitalized with a risk-based capital (“RBC”) ratio of 533%, well above the 400+% level I like to see, enabling ongoing capital releases.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares are attractive at 11x earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, AMP continues to perform well, and while shares are being weighed down by softness in cash revenue, I see this headwind as manageable and factored into valuation. Back in July, I saw the company earning at least $38. I also saw earnings rising to at least $41 next year, while its $2.2 billion of excess capital was worth $25—these factors drove my $600 price target.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I now see EPS of at least $38.25 this year, and I expect EPS of at least $41.50, assuming the S&amp;P remains at or above 6,700. Shares are trading at just 11x forward earnings, without even giving credit for its meaningful excess capital position. As time goes on, and AMP continues to grow EPS, I believe investors will appreciate that cash headwinds are not thesis-undermining, and valuation pressure will dissipate. I view 11x for a fee-based business with a solid balance sheet and strong buybacks as attractive. I would use weakness to <span>\"B</span>uy\" AMP.</p>",

The company's gross margin expansion is in a large part related to passing price increases but still recording \"cheaper\" inventory because of FIFO accounting. This will revert heavily in Q4 '25.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the name is performing well, but I do not believe it is attractively priced at about 10x earnings, given the outlook for U.S. macro and how growth is related to pricing. I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806130-rocky-brands-q2-probably-saw-the-benefits-but-not-the-costs-of-the-tariffs\">maintain</a> a Hold rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Very positive quarter</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rocky's quarter showed positive developments across all brands and across all lines of the income statement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of revenues, the company continues to post MSD growth, particularly in wholesale at 6% (3/4 of revenues). Revenues were up 7.5% in Q2, and also in Q1, so it has been a very good year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806130-rocky-brands-q2-probably-saw-the-benefits-but-not-the-costs-of-the-tariffs\">Last quarter</a>, I was worried this quarter might be worse because of earlier orders from wholesale due to tariffs, but so far, that has not happened.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of brands, the breadth is also improving. For the past year or so, the big performers have been Muck (muck boots) and XTRATUF (neoprene boots), two farming. In this quarter, these brands also performed very well, up double digits in wholesale, mainly from door expansion (they can be sold in farm &amp; ranch, fishing, hardware stores, regular sports shoe stores for XTRATUF, etc.). The company's more classical work boot brands, Rocky and Georgia, were in a worse position, but they are now both growing. The only name to call out is Durango, down, but in this case is where the earlier ordering from Q2 (+10% then) generated an effect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of gross profits, the company is pulling incredible numbers the whole year, with +390bps in Q1, 300bps in Q2, and now 200bps, all in wholesale. The reason for the gross margin improvement is a better mix (XTRATUF, Muck are better brands in terms of pricing power), lower promos from the recurrent challenges in wholesale post-2022, and, definitely, price increases from the tariffs that are not fully hitting the brands. In this case, the company said the tariff impact on COGS was already a 160bps headwind, meaning prices went up sensibly more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating expenses were probably the area where the company did worse, with OpEx as a percentage of sales growing between 100bps and 150bps (depending on the use of adjusted or not). Still, operating income grew almost 17%, and operating margins grew 70bps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With lower debt, as the company has been consistently using free cash flow to repay debt, interest also fell by 25% YoY.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tariffs ahead</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the results were good, especially surrounding brand development, breadth, and pricing power, I continue to worry about the potential impact of tariffs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are some factors to consider.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, although the company posted 200bps+ gain in gross margins every quarter of 9M25, management reiterated during <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834387-rocky-brands-inc-rcky-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">the call</a> that they expect the company to post 70bps lower gross margins for FY25 than for FY24. Although the aggregate difference is not substantial for the year, the fact that it will be all concentrated in Q4 is relevant. Management also said that the gross margin impact will last at least into 1H25, although sequentially improving. Operating margins will also be lower for the year, despite gains of almost 1pp in 9M25.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, if the company's cost headwind is 160bps in this quarter, and has also gained about 200bps of gross margins, then that adds for at least half, if not more, of the growth. It indicates volumes are not growing that much. The company said that its order books look well into Spring 2026 (H1 '26), with no challenges for price, and that sell-through is good, but in these businesses, the channel can easily glut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the company's inventory rotation is not that fast, barely above 1x, meaning it takes almost a year to go through inventory. With FIFO accounting (see <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/9687851\">10-K</a> under Inventories), that means the company gets to expense the cheapest inventory (from maybe three/four quarters ago) first.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_78f6ee4d34b533221cb4c9213bd9b56b.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_78f6ee4d34b533221cb4c9213bd9b56b.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_78f6ee4d34b533221cb4c9213bd9b56b.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_78f6ee4d34b533221cb4c9213bd9b56b.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_78f6ee4d34b533221cb4c9213bd9b56b.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_78f6ee4d34b533221cb4c9213bd9b56b.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_78f6ee4d34b533221cb4c9213bd9b56b.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_78f6ee4d34b533221cb4c9213bd9b56b.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_78f6ee4d34b533221cb4c9213bd9b56b.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that the company has been raising prices to offset higher-priced tariffed inventories, this shows up as a gain in gross margins, even when the business does not have structurally higher gross margins. Part of it also shows up as higher sales, even when no more shoes have been sold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rocky is very affected by tariffs, as it has a facility in Suzhou, China, that produces up to 50% of its products in FY24 (see <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4762015-rocky-brands-inc-rcky-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 '24 call</a>). Some brands, like Durango (leather boots), probably have even more exposure (comments in the latest call).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is without considering the impact on sell-through when consumers face higher prices for many goods in general.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation is still unattractive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is expecting to generate about $2.8 in profits per share this year, 10% more than last year (see latest call for guidance). This comes with a decrease in operating margins, but higher sales and, mainly, lower interest expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Compared to this, a current share price of around $29 does not look particularly high. It can be considered fair or even potentially attractive in a more neutral context, especially with many brands growing, the company delevering, and gross margins growing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, at least one of those factors (gross margins) is going to revert by year-end. Growth will also be impacted next year as price surcharges are nonrecurring. It is probable that FY26 comes with lower gross margins in aggregate (working through this year's tariffed inventories), with slower growth (LSD maybe). In a more negative consumer-environment scenario, gross and operating margins could decrease significantly.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For this reason, I cannot consider Rocky as attractively priced. It could be considered fair, but not more than that. Therefore, I maintain a Hold rating on the name.</p>",

Sam Chai, Vice President, Active Fixed Income Portfolio Management at TD Asset Management, speaks with MoneyTalk’s Greg Bonnell about the unique challenges facing the Fed and the road ahead for rates.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-embed paywall-full-content\" data-id=\"30221\" data-category=\"video\" data-provider=\"Brightcove\"><iframe src=\"https://seekingalpha.com/embed/30221\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" class=\"sa-embed-iframe embed-responsive-item\" data-original-width=\"640\" data-original-height=\"360\" data-id=\"30221\" data-category=\"video\" data-provider=\"Brightcove\"></iframe></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Transcript</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> US Federal Reserve lowered its overnight borrowing rate to a range of 3 and 3/4 to 4%, its second straight interest rate cut. Sam Chai of TD Asset Management here to talk us through the implications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sam, great to have you here today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sam Chai:</strong> Pleasure to be here, Greg.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> That first cut, it was called a risk management cut by the Fed. Are they starting to see where this cut in US economy that needs support from lower rates, or are they still just trying to head off any problems?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sam Chai:</strong> I would agree. I think this is a risk management cut by the Fed. And by that I mean the Fed more trying to mitigate potential downside risk, and in particular, trying to risk manage and balance the risks on both sides of the mandate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So just talk a little bit in more details, on the labor market side, core inflation in recent months haven't been picking up, and cumulative inflation passthrough from the tariff side have actually been slightly lower than the Fed expected. So I would say that while upside inflation risk still remains, it is actually less than feared.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, for labor market, while we didn't get the September non-farm payrolls, private sector job data signals that the September labor data likely to be slightly, slightly, continue to be sluggish. And so that downside risk in labor market remains present. So when thinking about that, the upside inflation risk has receded somewhat, while downside labor market risk remains, and that the Fed current policy rate remains restrictive, I think there's a good base for the Fed to make risk management cut today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> When you think about risk management and them not being overly worried about the path forward, I think there was a moment when you and I were watching the press conference with Jerome Powell where he talked about the fact that they're not on a preset course. December is not a done deal. So seems like they're still willing to take it meeting by meeting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sam Chai:</strong> Mm-hmm. And I don't find it to be particularly surprising because given that we're in this blackout period right now, it's tough for the Fed to pre-commit to a particular path. As we talked about earlier, this is a risk management cut, right? The Fed is not on a preset course to going back to neutral, to cut every meeting to 3%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And so I still think that the base case or the path of least resistance is for December cut to happen. But of course, that is not a done deal, like Chair Powell himself has said.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> So without that official government data going forward, and we don't seem to have a timeline for when they're going to start getting in, how is the Fed navigating? How is the Fed assessing the economy right now?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sam Chai:</strong> So, admittedly, we are in this data fog right now, right? And it's definitely making the Fed's job more challenging. The Fed could be relying on more other type of data, that includes the regional Fed collected data, private sector data, or just their business contacts for qualitative information.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But aside from the federal government data, we still get a variety of other data. For instance, for job market side, we get the JOLTS data. We get state level initial jobless claims data, which, although not published at the federal level, still gives us timely insights into the labor market conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On inflation, we got the latest CPI data for September, but we still receive survey of inflation expectation data, too. And there's also no shortage of GDP nowcast models, which, for instance, the Atlanta Fed publishes. So all this information help to guide our understanding on the macro factor side. But of course, it's making the Fed's job somewhat more challenging.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> Now, they also told us today that, as was expected by the market, they will be ending quantitative tightening. I think it was the beginning of December is what they're aiming for there. In the run-up to that, people started talking about quantitative easing. Is it too quick just to go from the end of QT to start talking about QE?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sam Chai:</strong> I think so. I think it is indeed too soon to talk about quantitative easing. I like to think about the Fed changing their policy direction like steering a ship. It's gradual and it's measured.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But taking a step back as to why the Fed is announcing the end of quantitative tightening today, so looking at indicator from money market, from funding market, we have seen that there's a signal that the US economy possibly has transitioned from the abundant reserve regime, which is how the Fed likes to term it, to now an ample reserve regime. So, less abundant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And the Fed likes to still have ample reserves in the economy to ensure liquidity in the financial market, and also the effective transmission mechanism remain in place for policy rates. So the Fed is not looking to shrink their balance sheet further and reduce the reserve level, and hence why they're looking to end the QT program, as you mentioned, at the beginning of December.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I do think that for us to see quantitative easing, we need to really be in a place where it's very clear the economy needs more support from the policy in a very timely fashion, and that policy rate is likely not having more room to provide that accommodation. Obviously, that's not the case right now because policy rate remains relatively elevated. And so I think we're still quite some distance away from that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> Now one more decision before the end of this year. As we head into 2026, we know that Fed Chair Jerome Powell's term is coming to an end. How much should we be concerned about Fed independence?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sam Chai:</strong> I think that will very much still be a theme going into next year. So Chair Powell's term will be ending next May. Months before that, Trump will be appointing the new Fed Chair. And needless to say, the White House prefers a new Fed Chair who possibly have a much more dovish take on where the monetary policy should be heading versus the current chair.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But to the extent that the market can see that the new Fed Chair decision may have been more politically motivated rather than purely on economic rationales, this could be eroding the market's confidence in the Fed independence, and more importantly, the Fed's ability to anchor inflation over the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other thing is that earlier next year, we'll have the Supreme Court ruling on Governor Lisa Cook's case. And to the extent that that ruling could be favorable for the White House, that could exacerbate this concern reduced Fed independence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And just to try to tie it back to the market somewhat, a common way for the market to express this loss of Fed independence theme is by placing a curve steepener bet on the market. In particular, it means that expecting the short end of the interest rate curve to move down on a very dovish Fed. At the same time, the longer end of the interest rate curve could move higher relative to the front end because of the investor being more concerned about long-term inflation and demanding higher term premium. So that will continue to be a theme I think is very interesting to watch next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> There's a lot there. You broke it down beautifully. How does it all play out for the fixed income markets?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sam Chai:</strong> As we discussed earlier, I do still think that the path of least resistance remains to be a cut in December. Of course, that is not a guarantee. That's not a preset course. But I think the burden of the proof is really on the data to prove that another risk management cut is not warranted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think it's also interesting to talk about alternative scenario two, right? I think for the Fed to essentially skip a December cut, what they need to see is two things. One, a refirming of labor market, possibly an increase in pace of monthly job gains, and also a receleration of inflation as well, because the downside risk to labor market is unlikely to dissipate that quickly in a few months of time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, what would be needed for the Fed to deliver a 50 bps cut? Unlikely, but for that, I think the Fed really needs to see a major deterioration in labor market data. And in that scenario, inflation may actually come into second place in considerations. So while I think overall the risk/reward for fixed income security right now is quite balanced, I think it's important to pay attention to that skew in tail scenarios. In particular, pay more attention to labor market data.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.moneytalkgo.com/video/u-s-fed-cuts-rates-amid-economic-and-data-uncertainty/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p>",
