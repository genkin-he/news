As generative AI models grow more capable and associated hardware becomes cheaper and more versatile, we’re rapidly advancing into the era of physical AI, where networks of machines can think, see, move, and act in real time to augment human workflows.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This shift carries profound implications. Human labor productivity could be supercharged as people increasingly deploy robots for physical tasks. Entirely new use cases will emerge across sectors such as last-mile logistics, self-driving, and robotic manufacturing. Ultimately, this could culminate in Humanoid systems advancing, as general-purpose physical AI brings intelligent automation to everyday businesses and households. In our view, Robotics &amp; Physical AI form a defining theme of the intelligence age. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Manufacturing’s Automation Shift Is Now an Economic Imperative</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Manufacturing has long been central to robotics adoption. Global stock of industrial robots already totals roughly 4.7 million, offering automation a healthy installed base into a core sector of the economy.<sup>1</sup> That adoption is expected to further accelerate as new priorities such as reshoring and reindustrialization take shape in strategic industries such as semiconductors and electric vehicle (EV) components.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2024, new global industrial robot installations reached 542,000 units, more than doubling over the past decade and marking the second-highest annual installation count of industrial robots in history.<sup>2</sup> Asia accounted for 74% of new deployments, compared with 16% in Europe and 9% in the Americas. Annual installations are projected to rise another 6% in 2025 and surpass 700,000 units by 2028, underscoring automation’s steady advance.<sup> 3</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Falling automation costs and rising labor expenses further reinforce the structural global reshoring shift. Average U.S. hourly manufacturing wages reached $34 in 2025, and are expected to rise to $39 by decades end.<sup>4</sup> Meanwhile, the average cost of an industrial robot is expected to continue to compress, while functionalities improve.<sup>5</sup> These dynamics enable a greater quantity and flexibility of robotic systems to operate in a wider range of settings, shifting the economic advantage in favor of automation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Robots are also getting smarter and more flexible due to AI. Rather than the rigid, fixed setups of the past, software-defined robot platforms with standardized interfaces enable plug-and-play adaptation. This modularization reduces downtime, supports reconfiguration, and lowers integration risk. In effect, companies get the economics of mass customization. Continuous improvements in algorithms, semiconductor efficiency, and power systems are accelerating this shift.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Collaborative robots, or cobots, are also expanding the frontier of industrial automation. Designed to work safely alongside humans, they take on hazardous, repetitive, or precision tasks at a fraction of the cost, allowing workers to focus on higher-value activities such as design, supervision, and decision-making.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"3651\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251010 - Charting Disruption_01-0.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"701\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Robotics Is Advancing Rapidly Across Services</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Improving intelligence is helping Robotics move rapidly beyond factory floors into the everyday economy, such as warehouses, hospitals, delivery networks, and retail spaces. These segments face chronic labor shortages, high turnover, and rising expectations for speed and precision, creating ideal conditions for automation to thrive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In logistics, autonomous mobile robots now manage everything from pallet movement to last-mile sorting. Amazon alone operates over one million warehouse robots worldwide by using fleets like Proteus and Sparrow to transport and identify packages with minimal human input.<sup>6</sup> Walmart, FedEx, and DHL are also integrating robotics to stabilize throughput and protect against labor volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In healthcare, surgical robots are transforming the operating room by enhancing precision, reducing recovery times, and expanding access to complex procedures. In 2025, it’s estimated that roughly 50% of surgeons perform some type of general robotics surgery, up from just 9% in 2012.<sup>7</sup> Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci installed robot base has nearly doubled in the last five years, reaching 10,488 installed units in June 2025.<sup>8</sup> Beyond the operating room, hospitals use autonomous systems for medication delivery, sanitation, and patient mobility support, freeing up nurses and technicians to focus on direct care.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In retail, robots increasingly monitor shelf inventory, restocking items, and cleaning aisles. In hospitality, autonomous butlers and delivery bots are increasingly common in hotels across Asia and the U.S., handling room service and concierge logistics. The food industry has begun to implement automated kitchen arms that assemble burgers, brew coffee, and mix drinks with precision and consistency. And in transportation, autonomous robotaxis and delivery pods travel city streets, building toward a future where goods and people move seamlessly through networks of intelligent machines. Since launching its commercial service in 2018, Waymo now handles over 250,000 driverless trips across five major U.S. cities.<sup>9</sup></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Evolution of Physical AI Culminates in Humanoid Development</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.globalxetfs.com/articles/the-rise-of-humanoids-explained\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer noopener\">Humanoid robots</a> are emerging as the next major frontier in physical automation, bridging the gap between industrial machinery and intelligent, adaptive assistants designed for human environments. Unlike traditional factory robots, which are fixed and specialized, humanoids walk, see, manipulate objects, and communicate naturally. They’re designed for the spaces people already inhabit, such as warehouses, hospitals, offices, and eventually homes, giving them enormous potential to address global labor shortages, support aging populations, and unlock new forms of productivity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market opportunity is vast. Humanoid adoption could touch roughly one-third of industrial labor roles and up to 15% of global households by the mid-2030s, translating to nearly $5 trillion in total economic potential.<sup>10</sup> Pilots for early prototypes, such as Agility Robotics’ Digit and Figure’s humanoid models, are already underway in logistics and manufacturing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By 2030, it’s estimated that global annual humanoid sales could reach 1 million, just 17 years after commercial humanoid sales began. By 2040, cumulative humanoid unit sales could potentially reach 400 million.<sup>11</sup> Such a trajectory would closely parallel the early expansion of the automobile industry, which similarly took about 17 years to progress from initial commercialization to 1 million units sold.<sup>12</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"4584\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251010 - Charting Disruption_02-1.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"880\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Physical Intelligence Starts to Make Its Mark</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The rise of Robotics and Physical AI marks a structural transformation in the global economy, as intelligence extends from the digital realm into the physical world. Automation that once centered on manufacturing is now advancing across a wide range of industries, improving productivity, precision, and scalability. As humanoid and autonomous systems evolve, they will increasingly bridge the gap between industrial capability and human adaptability. Collectively, these developments position Robotics and Physical AI as a defining investment theme of the intelligence age – one with the potential to reshape productivity, open new markets, and drive long-term economic growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>IFR.

For those not familiar with the enterprise, it operates as a ‘daytime dining’ a company that serves<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> customers made-to-order breakfasts, brunches, and lunches. The reason why the company jumped out was because one of its locations is actually quite close to my house and because I have eaten from it on multiple occasions. So naturally, as a foodie and an investor, I would want to dig in more. What I found is a vibrant company that's growing at a rapid pace. Often, these types of firms have a tendency to be expensive. But not this one. In fact, based on my own estimates that I believe to be relatively conservative, I would argue that it offers market beating potential moving forward. As such, I have no problem rating it a ‘buy’ at this time.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I do think that one thing that investors should be mindful of is that earnings are coming up soon. Before the market opens on November 4th, management should be serving up financial results covering the third quarter of the company's 2025 fiscal year. Leading up to that point, revenue and profits are both forecasted to rise nicely. But in this uncertain economic climate, investors would be wise to keep a close eye on matters.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Digging Into First Watch Restaurant Group</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I mentioned already, First Watch Restaurant Group is a daytime dining firm <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1789940/000178994025000010/fwrg-20241229.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">that is focused</a> on preparing for its customers made-to-order breakfasts, brunches, and lunches. In my head, I fit it into the same category as a Bob Evans or <strong>Denny's</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DENN\" title=\"Denny's Corporation\">DENN</a>). However, this firm is unique in that its <a href=\"https://investors.firstwatch.com/static-files/192042db-bbf5-48d1-85a4-25c643c17cc4\" rel=\"nofollow\">locations</a> are typically only open for 7.5 hours a day. You would think that such restrictive hours would make it hard for the locations that it has to perform well. But even with this, the average restaurant generates around $2.2 million worth of revenue each year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company makes itself stand out in a couple of ways. For starters, management makes sure to keep their menu fresh. In the second quarter of this year, for instance, some of the items that it had on its menu included bacon cheddar cornbread, wild berry lavender French toast, a bacon, egg, and cheddar sandwich, and pineapple beverages. Other examples would be its blueberry lemon cornbread, shrimp and grits, and more. This menu is then supercharged through the use of fresh and quality ingredients. I don't know about you, but the number of times I have been to a restaurant that did not take that simple and obvious principle to heart, has been astronomical.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2238\" data-height=\"876\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"251\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"251\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In recent years, management has achieved remarkable growth. Back in 2022, revenue stood at $730.2 million. Last year, sales had grown to $1.02 billion. This growth was driven largely by an increase in the number of locations that the firm has in operation. They grew from 474 to 572 over this window of time. However, this growth is a bit deceptive. During that three-year window, the number of franchised locations actually contracted from 108 to 83. And the number of company-owned restaurants jumped from 366 to 489. By shifting away from franchised locations and toward company-owned ones, management is able to capture more revenue and to better control the quality of the experience for customers. The downside to this, however, is that there is a risk of lower margins. But by prioritizing scaling at the rest strong level, management likely hopes to offset this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2018\" data-height=\"888\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"282\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"282\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Same restaurant sales have also increased, but this picture is more nuanced. 2022 saw an increase of 14.5% on a same restaurant basis. This is almost certainly because of the economy recovering after the COVID-19 pandemic. There was another 7.6% increase in 2023, though in 2024 there was a decline of 0.5% as traffic fell 4%. I do know that consumers are becoming increasingly constrained from a financial standpoint. And the fact of the matter is that eating out is practically always more expensive than eating at home. The good news is that this year, things are looking up. But before we touch on that, I do think touching on bottom line performance for the company is appropriate also.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1812\" data-height=\"904\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"319\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"319\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The first chart in this article shows that, as revenue for the institution grew, so too did profitability. This included net income, operating cash flow, adjusted operating cash flow that essentially just strips out changes in working capital, and EBITDA. In the chart above, you can see that, while this year the firm is seeing some downside from a margin perspective, the restaurant level total profit margin that the company has exhibited has increased as it has grown. This further validates my previous statement regarding the firm's motivation to shift more and more toward an ownership approach to its expansion as opposed to a franchise-based one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2220\" data-height=\"874\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"252\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"252\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For this year, revenue for the company continues to expand. Sales during the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1789940/000178994025000072/fwrg-20250629.htm#i7db0b3c4416f43dab44d60642fe1b548_85\" rel=\"nofollow\">first half of 2025</a> amounted to $590.1 million. That's up 17.8% compared to the $501 million the company reported last year. Some of this was because of a 2.1% increase in same restaurant sales. But the vast majority came from a jump in the number of restaurants from 538 to 600. This came at a time when the number of franchised locations declined from 79 to 69, and was driven by a surge in the number of company-owned locations from 459 to 531.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to this year, management expects the total number of net new restaurants to increase by between 59 and 64. Between 7 and 9 of these will be franchised locations. But mostly, the company is adding between 55 and 58 company owned restaurants. This should help to propel EBITDA to between $119 million and $123 million. But as I mentioned already, this year the firm has suffered from some margin contraction. While some of this is because of higher labor and other related expenses, a lot of it seems to come from a rise in food and beverage costs. Management blamed this on new restaurants that it acquired, and the lower margins they typically result in, as well as commodity inflation and the firm's decision to shift toward a meat heavy menu. So we are going to see some profit increase, but as the chart that shows financial results for the first half of this year demonstrates, profitability as a percentage of revenue is certainly going to decline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1830\" data-height=\"884\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trading Multiples\" width=\"640\" height=\"309\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"309\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the chart above, you can see how shares of the company are currently priced using estimates for 2025 and historical results for 2024.

This is because the economics of growth makes sense here. According to management, the typical build-out cost of a single location is $1.75 million. But over the ensuing three years, the average revenue achieved by these locations is around $2.7 million. And given the 18% to 20% restaurant level operating margin, we get an internal rate of return of around 18% or greater for each store. That's why management is dedicated this year to spending $148 million to $152 million on capital projects, with most of that focused on growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Projecting into the future is always fraught with uncertainty. But by using some reasonable assumptions, such as the firm's target of a 3.5% same store sales increase each year, the same margins that the company exhibited last year since I suspect it will be able to eventually return to those levels thanks to scalability and raising its prices to offset higher costs, and by using some other reasonable estimates, I was able to create the table below. In it, you can see how much the company could expand if it decides not to take on any additional debt and uses all excess capital toward growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1604\" data-height=\"1268\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Projections\" width=\"640\" height=\"506\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"506\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming this ends up being the case, we can see how, by the year 2030, the company could grow to generate $2.16 billion in revenue, with system wide sales of about $2.47 billion. If we use these as base level estimates for the future, we can then see in the chart below how much annual upside the company should exhibit if it trades at the same multiples that it's trading for today. Considering that the S&amp;P 500 typically averages between 10% and 11% annually, I would consider these potential returns to justify a bullish outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1808\" data-height=\"886\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Upside\" width=\"640\" height=\"314\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"314\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, anything can change as new data comes in. It just so happens that, before the market opens on November 4th, management will be announcing financial results for the third quarter of the 2025 fiscal year. Analysts currently <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FWRG/earnings\">expect</a> revenue to come in at $309.3 million, which would be up 22.9% compared to the $251.6 million the company reported a year earlier. They also expect earnings per share to grow from $0.03 to $0.07, which would take net profits up from $2.1 million to $4.4 million. As the table below illustrates, the firm did generate positive cash flow in the third quarter of last year. And I would venture to say that if revenue and profits do increase this year, these cash flow metrics will grow also.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1364\" data-height=\"410\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Estimates\" width=\"640\" height=\"192\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"192\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on all the data currently available, I would say that First Watch Restaurant Group justifies a bullish outlook. Management is actively working to grow the business, and the overall trajectory that it has been on is impressive. My own analysis, which assumes management does not lever up in order to grow more rapidly, seems to show conservatively that upside is likely to exceed what the broader market would enjoy. And with analysts optimistic as well, I have no reason not to be myself. Because of this, I believe that assigning it a 'buy' rating is the right choice.</p>",

This suggests that in the YTD, industrial occupancy is a little under 100%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The firm’s Mining Royalty Lands Segment owns around 16,648 acres of properties that are leased for rents and royalties purposes, and 4,280 acres as part of a Brooksville joint venture with Vulcan Materials Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VMC\" title=\"Vulcan Materials Company\">VMC</a>). Of these assets, only one is in Virginia, and the rest are in Florida and Georgia. In Q2 2025, the segment’s NOI increased by 21% to $3.67 million as royalty payments and unrealized revenues recovered from the year prior. In the YTD, NOI increased by 20% to $6.95 million due to a recovery in royalty payments and unrealized revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FRP’s Development Segment owns and monitors its development land and seeks to convert it from non-income-producing to income-producing by building income generating assets such as apartments, or selling them or doing a joint venture.

Development Segment properties that are built up are transferred to this segment when some threshold occupancy rate is achieved. In Q2 2025, pro rata NOI rose by 1% to $4.74 million, while in the YTD, it increased by 2% to $9.37 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One thing is clear: the business model is asset-heavy, and so, at a minimum, returns will be very low, given the capital that is needed to fund expansion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Betting on the Bakers</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FRP’s executive chairman and former CEO, John D. Baker II owns around 17.5% of the company, while members of his family own 17.8% of the company, and his son, John D. Baker III serves as the current CEO. This means that the Bakers have a lot of influence in the Board of Directors and in the running of the company. Investors have to trust that the interests of the Bakers are aligned with theirs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Declining Profitability</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since 2020, the company’s revenue has grown from $17.89 million to $32.29 million in the trailing <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"twelve\" htloopnumber=\"292897251\">twelve</em> months (TTM). However, the firm’s profitability has declined since then, from $12.72 million to $5.33 million. The firm’s margins have been poor. While operating margin has risen from -3.11% in 2020 to -0.13% in the TTM, they still show that the business’ core operations are not generating a profit. Profit margins have declined from 71.06% in 2020 to 16.5% in the TTM. The company only started measuring NOI in 2021? and that has grown from $17.6 million to $39.39 million. Baker III has guided for flat NOI in full-year 2025, saying,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>“that level of growth, while remarkable, is also unsustainable.</p> <p>Due to the timing of construction, delivery, and investment, we expect NOI in 2025 to remain flat if not slightly off of 2024. In the Industrial and Commercial Segment, 53% of the platform will be vacant and up for renewal. These vacancies at Cranberry and at our new Chelsea building will take time to lease-up and will have operating expenses that will eat into 2025 NOI when compared to 2024. The lease-up of <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"three\" htloopnumber=\"292897251\">three</em> different projects (Verge, Bryant Street, and .408 Jackson) in our Multifamily segment was a huge driver of 2024 NOI growth. The rapid NOI growth we experienced with the lease-ups will give way in 2025 to more organic growth as we grow rents on already stabilized assets, a particular challenge for the DC assets which will be competing with a glut of new projects. Mining royalties should remain strong in 2025, though from an NOI perspective, it will be difficult to keep pace with 2024, simply for the fact that we received a considerable back dated minimum payment at one location, which we can’t replicate for obvious reasons.”</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That also seems to imply that net income will also be flat or down from 2024 levels. The firm’s efficiency levels are poor: returns on assets (ROA) have risen from -0.07% to -0.00%, and return on equity (ROE) has declined from 3.03% to 1.17%. This is to be expected: the business model is asset heavy, so returns even at the best of times are likely to be low. That they are negative suggests that the company does not have the ability to extract more income from its value chain. Returns are likely to decline further: Baker III spoke of 2025 as “year zero” of FRP’s industrial growth strategy, outlining plans to, “build <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"three\" htloopnumber=\"292897251\">three</em> new industrial projects every <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"two\" htloopnumber=\"292897251\">two</em> years for the foreseeable future and look to double the size of our industrial platform over the next <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"five\" htloopnumber=\"292897251\">five</em> years”. These investments may pay off in future, but, in the interim, they will erode returns.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Has Downsides</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the current price, FRP has a price/earnings (P/E) multiple of 82.29, compared to an average of 106.52 for <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FRPH/peers/comparison?axis=linear&amp;metric=pe_ratio\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FRPH/peers/comparison?axis=linear&amp;metric=pe_ratio\" target=\"_blank\">its peers</a>, IRSA Inversiones y Representaciones Sociedad Anónima (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IRS\" title=\"IRSA Inversiones y Representaciones Sociedad Anónima\">IRS</a>), Corporación Inmobiliaria Vesta, S.A.B. de C.V.

This is clear from its declining net income, negative operating margins, and abysmal ROA and ROE, all of which signal a business struggling to profit from its operations. Furthermore, its current valuation, with a P/E ratio of 82.29, carries significant downsides. Management's own guidance for flat NOI in 2025, coupled with the significant capital required to execute its \"year zero\" industrial expansion plan, promises continued pressure on profitability and returns for the foreseeable future. As a result, the company’s share price is likely to continue to fare badly and I assign the stock a “Sell” rating.</p>",

Each stage – from the materials that power production to the applications transforming industries – builds on the one before it, creating a continuous cycle of progress. Understanding how these forces interact offers a clearer view of where disruption begins, how it scales, and where tomorrow’s opportunities may emerge.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Exhaustible Resources: Securing the Foundations of Innovation</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Technological progress begins with access to finite materials that power production, electrification, and the infrastructure on which modern economies depend.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Copper, also known as the \"metal of electrification,\" is seeing a sharp rise in demand due to its high electrical conductivity and malleability, perfect for use in medical devices and EVs, as well as solar and wind energy.<sup>1</sup> </li> <li>Due to their use in EVs – not to mention smartphones, laptops, power tools, and cameras – the demand for lithium-ion batteries is projected to grow seven-fold between 2022 and 2030.<sup>2</sup> </li> <li>Permanent magnets accounted for 42.5% of rare earth element demand in 2023 for their use in electronics, such as cell phones, and clean energy systems, such as fuel cells.<sup>3</sup> </li> <li>Silver’s high electrical conductivity, strong thermal conductivity, antimicrobial properties, and ability to reflect 95-99% of visible light makes it critical to industrial applications such as solar panels.<sup>4</sup> </li> <li>Using AI to help generate a 100-word email uses just over one bottle of water.<sup>5</sup> </li> <li>Less than ten pellets of uranium fuel – approximately the weight of 10 AA batteries – can power the average household for a year.<sup>6</sup> </li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sustaining technological progress depends not only on discovery but on the reliable availability of the materials that make it possible. As demand for copper, lithium, uranium, and rare earths accelerates alongside electrification and automation, ensuring access to these essential inputs is critical to maintaining momentum. Efficient production, responsible sourcing, and advances in recycling and substitution will all play a role in preventing material scarcity from becoming a bottleneck to innovation.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Structural Needs: Building the Infrastructure for Growth</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As global demand for energy, connectivity, and production capacity accelerates, the world’s physical and organizational systems are under pressure to expand, modernize, and sustain long-term growth.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Global fragmentation, aging infrastructure assets, shifting demographics, climate change, and the rise of disruptive technologies are driving an urgent need for as much as $106 trillion in infrastructure investment through 2040.<sup>7</sup> </li> <li>By 2035, projections anticipate data center electricity consumption at 1,596 TWh, positioning their demand between the 2024 usage levels of Russia (1,193 TWh) and India (2,027 TWh).<sup>8,9</sup> </li> <li>Nuclear power represents a potential fuel source with a low average CO<sub>2</sub> life cycle, low land footprint, and one of the highest uptime rates of any energy source.<sup>10</sup> </li> <li>Achieving national energy ambitions will require adding or upgrading around 80 million kilometers of power grids by 2040, the equivalent of rebuilding the entire existing global power network.<sup>11</sup> </li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The modernization of infrastructure is no longer a long-term aspiration but an economic imperative. Trillions in investment will be required to replace aging assets, expand grid capacity, and build the physical backbone for a more digital, electrified, and interconnected world. These structural systems – spanning transportation, manufacturing, and energy – serve as the bridge between physical resources and technological progress. Their evolution will dictate how efficiently economies can adapt to disruption, support innovation, and sustain resilience in an era defined by accelerated change.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Enabling Technologies: Powering the Digital Core</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Digital and computational systems such as semiconductors, data centers, and cloud infrastructure provide the backbone for automation, scalability, and innovation across industries.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Surge in accelerated computing is compelling chipmakers and equipment suppliers to ramp and retool for sub-5 nm semiconductor production, critical for producing next-gen processing hardware. By 2030, nearly $500 billion could be spent annually on AI chips, driving at least half a trillion in semi manufacturing CapEx.<sup>12</sup> </li> <li>To meet the anticipated 2030 global data center demand, projections estimate an investment need of nearly $7 trillion – $5.2 trillion for facilities supporting AI processing and $1.5 trillion for traditional IT applications.<sup>13</sup> </li> <li>Propelled by rapid advances in smaller, more efficient models, the cost of running inference at GPT-3.5 performance levels fell more than 280-fold between November 2022 and October 2024, as hardware expenses declined by roughly 30% per year and energy efficiency improved by about 40% annually.<sup>14</sup> </li> <li>Global cloud infrastructure spending is projected to surpass $400 billion in 2025, with approximately 60% of the market captured by Amazon Web Services (30%), Microsoft’s Azure (20%), and Google Cloud (13%).<sup>15</sup> </li> <li>Cybersecurity remains a top priority for businesses and individuals, as the Federal Bureau of Investigation revealed over $16 billion in losses due to cybercrime in 2024, up 33% from 2023.<sup>16</sup> </li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The surge in computing power, connectivity, and automation underscores a new phase of efficiency and intelligence across industries. From semiconductors to cloud networks, technological capacity is compounding – reducing costs, expanding scale, and transforming what’s possible. As innovation accelerates, these enabling systems no longer function as support infrastructure alone; they have become the engines of transformation themselves. Their continued advancement will shape how effectively new applications emerge, connect, and redefine the modern economy.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Applications: Turning Innovation into Impact</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Innovation ultimately finds meaning through real-world use – transforming ideas into solutions that redefine industries, improve lives, and drive global growth.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>In addition to success rates between 94% and 100%, robot-assisted surgeries may offer several patient benefits, including reduced postoperative discomfort, lower likelihood of infection, minimized blood loss, shortened hospital recovery times, and less visible scarring.<sup>17</sup> </li> <li>Cheap and adaptable drones offer significant economic advantages in warfare over traditional tanks, costing 25,000 times less, reducing time to build by 4,380 times, and offering 50,000 times the production capacity.<sup>18,19,20</sup> </li> <li>Global EV sales surpassed 17 million units in 2024, pushing their share of the global car market above 20% for the first time.<sup>21</sup> With affordability improving across regions, EVs are on track to exceed a 40% market share by 2030.<sup>22</sup> </li> <li>Currently, drugs take about 10-15 years and $1.8 billion to develop, while just 10% of investigational treatments gain approval, but AI can help reduce pre-clinical delays and lower costs by up to 50%.<sup>23,24,25,26</sup> </li> <li>GLP-1 therapies continue to demonstrate strong potential for weight management and a wide range of other health applications, contributing to projected revenues of $183 billion by 2032.<sup>27</sup> </li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As these innovations mature, their influence extends beyond individual sectors – shaping productivity, resilience, and global competitiveness. What once marked the frontier of technology is rapidly becoming the foundation of a new economic paradigm, where investing in innovation means investing in the long-term transformation of everyday life.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The interplay between technological innovation and macroeconomic transformation is reshaping how growth emerges and where opportunity concentrates. Thematic investing offers a framework for capturing this evolution – identifying the structural forces, from digitalization to decarbonization, that transcend sectors and market cycles. By looking beyond traditional classifications, investors can better position for the convergence of trends driving the global economy forward. Innovation may be unpredictable in form, but its trajectory – toward deeper integration, greater efficiency, and expanding impact – remains unmistakably clear.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Ross, L., &amp; de Naoum, K.

I rated UTG as a HOLD after balancing the upside risks from the same potential policy shift and the valuation risks judging by its below-average dividend yield.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since then, a few new catalysts have surfaced both in terms of macroeconomic conditions and also fund-specific changes. In the remainder of this article, I will detail the most important catalyst in each category on my list: the change in interest rates and also the relative valuation changes of UTG and UTF. After examining these changes, my conclusion is that UTF provides a better return/risk curve than UTG due to A) its more aggressive use of leverage and B) its sizable valuation discount relative to UTG.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me start with the changes in interest rates. I assume you already know that the Federal Reserve has just announced another cut of 25 basis points early this week. The cut was widely expected by the market a while before the Fed made the official announcement, as you can tell from the chart below. Wednesday. To be more specific, the chart below displays the 10-Year Treasury Rate (I:10YTR) and the 3-Month Treasury Rate (I:3MTRNK) in the past year. As seen, both long- and short-term treasury yields have been trending downward since my last writings (i.e., around the July to Aug timeframe). After the Fed rate cut was officially announced, both 10-Year and 3-month treasury rates dropped further to ~4.0% and ~3.9%, both hovering near the 52-week low.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, the market expects dominant odds for another 25 basis point cut by the end of 2025 per data provided by <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CME Group FedWatch Tool</a> (see the second chart below). Amid such a trend of decreasing rates, I feel it's a good time to bet more aggressively on the utility sector, and UTF is the fund that uses more leverage than UTG as detailed next.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921430312074_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1127\" data-height=\"505\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921430312074_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph with a line graph AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"287\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921430312074_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921430312074_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921430312074_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921430312074_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921430312074_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921430312074_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921430312074_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921430312074_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Seeking Alpha</p></figcaption></figure> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921432706714_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1974\" data-height=\"1318\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921432706714_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921432706714_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921432706714_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921432706714_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921432706714_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921432706714_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921432706714_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921432706714_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-1761921432706714_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">FedWatch</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">UTG and UTF CEFs: basic information and exposure</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before moving onto further specifics, I feel this is a good place to cover some basics for both CEFs in case there are investors unfamiliar with them. Both funds are popular CEFs for investors seeking concentrated exposure to utility/infrastructure stocks, and their specific investment strategies are quoted below. Both funds have a long history (both incepted in 2004) and feature similarly sizable AUM of around $2.5B to $3.5B. Notionally, UTF has a slightly higher expense ratio of 2.29% compared to UTG's 2.23%, as shown in the chart below.

UTG's portfolio is heavily concentrated in the US, with a 108% weight (which exceeds 100% due to leverage). Ex-US exposure is minimal in the UTG funds, with Canada, the largest overseas exposure, representing 5.75% of exposure. In contrast, UTF is more geared toward ex-US exposure, with its US holdings representing less than ½ of its total assets (at a weight of 45.6%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As detailed in my earlier articles, I feel more bullish towards domestic utility/infrastructure stocks given my anticipation of the policy shift in the US. However, as to be argued next, I believe UTF's use of leverage and valuation discount could make this up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302882264_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1430\" data-height=\"314\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302882264_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"141\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302882264_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302882264_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302882264_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302882264_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302882264_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302882264_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302882264_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302882264_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CEFconnect</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">UTG and UTF CEF: leverage in focus</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next table compares the capital structure for UTG and UTF as of their latest fund disclosures dated on 10/30/2025.

As shown in the table below, the fee structures for UTF and UTG are quite different. In terms of headline annual expense ratios, UTF has a substantially higher total expense ratio of 3.86%, 1.43% above UTG's total expense ratio of 2.43%. However, a closer look reveals that this difference is mostly driven by higher interest expenses, where UTF is charged with a 2.47% interest expense compared to 1.49% for UTG. This is a difference of almost 1%. As such, with the market's expectation of lower interest rates ahead, I expect this to translate into a larger reduction in leverage cost for UTF than UTG, which in turn should help boost UTF's valuation and profits more substantially than UTG.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302417147_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1495\" data-height=\"656\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302417147_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"281\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302417147_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302417147_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302417147_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302417147_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302417147_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302417147_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302417147_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214302417147_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CEFconnect</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">UTG and UTF CEF: yield and valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of valuation, UTF is also currently valued at a sizable discount relative to UTG, judging by their dividend yield spread. To wit, the next chart illustrates the historical dividend yield spread (YSF) between UTF and UTG since their inception. The spread is calculated as UTF's TTM yield minus that of UTG. As seen, the YS has exhibited some volatility over the years, but has fluctuated closely around a long-term average of 0.944%, a reflection of the stability embedded in utility/infrastructure stocks. The current YS is 1.593% as seen, notably higher than the historical average and indicating UTF's favorable valuation relative to UTG.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303959243_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1971\" data-height=\"614\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303959243_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph with a line graph AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"199\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303959243_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303959243_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303959243_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303959243_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303959243_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303959243_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303959243_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303959243_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Seeking Alpha</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other risks and final thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">UTF's valuation discount is also reflected in a vertical comparison, as shown in the last chart below. UTF currently provides a TTM Dividend Yield of 7.88%, which is slightly above its 4-year average yield of 7.75% (by about 2%) and indicates a slight valuation discount. In contrast, UTG has a TTM Dividend Yield of 6.05%, which is significantly below its 4-year average yield of 7.56% by about 20% and indicates a sizable valuation premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, UTG is a solid fund in its own right too (and after all, I am rating it as a hold, not a sell). The fund offers concentrated - and also leveraged - bets on domestic stocks in a sector where I expect policy tailwinds for the next few years. UTG also features lower fees, with interest expenses excluded, than UTF. If you recall from an earlier chart, UTF's Management Fees are 1.20%, notably higher than UTG's 0.71% (although UTF's other expenses are 0.19%, slightly below the 0.23% charged by UTG).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All told, this comparison between UTF and UTG is largely motivated by two recent changes: the changes in interest rates and also fund-specific changes. Changes in the first category made me favor a fund with more leverage, and changes in the second category made UTF's valuation very attractive compared to UTG. My verdict is that these considerations should be sufficient to overcome UTF's fee drag and lower US exposure, resulting in a more favorable return/risk ratio than UTG.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303230333_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1271\" data-height=\"465\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303230333_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"234\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303230333_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303230333_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303230333_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303230333_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303230333_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303230333_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303230333_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48844541-17619214303230333_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Seeking Alpha</p></figcaption></figure></p>",

In this episode of the MoneyShow MoneyMasters Podcast, Ed Clissold, Chief US Strategist at Ned<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> Davis Research, pulls back the curtain on what’s really powering the markets as 2025 winds down.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Transcript</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mike Larson:</strong> Are all those AI companies making all those AI deals about to fly off the proverbial hamster wheel, or does this artificial intelligence CapEx boom still have room to run? Is Fed policy going to remain friendly to markets well into 2026, or could we be in store for a monetary policy surprise next year? And what about jobs? Amazon, UPS, JPMorgan Chase, they're all laying off thousands and thousands of workers or making do with less because they can, thanks to AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I brought an all-new guest on the MoneyShow MoneyMasters Podcast to unspool it all and explain what these key market developments mean for investors like you. His name is Ed Clissold, and he is Chief U.S. Strategist at Ned Davis Research. Ed, welcome to the podcast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ed, thank you so much for joining me. I know there's a lot going on in the markets, and I want to get right to that in a minute, but since I haven't had you on the podcast before, can you talk a little bit about what your background is and what you do there at Ned Davis?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Ed Clissold:</strong> Sure. So, I've been at NDR for 22 years. I was actually a client of NDR at a regional brokerage firm in Nashville, Tennessee, called J.C. Bradford. For those of you who've been around a while, maybe you've heard of it. That's also where Ned was before he founded NDR. So, that was my connection to the company, and this was in the late '90s when the screens were green every day. And you had this guy saying, it's going on for a while, but this isn't how the world really works. Eventually, you're going to pay for it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, I came out of business school ’02. By that point, the bubble had burst and no one wanted to hire anybody, but there's Ned Davis Research because they were growing because they had the foresight, and Ned had the foresight. So, I've been in NDR since then. I worked on the global team for a while, but for the last dozen years or so, I've been the U.S. Strategist, focused on U.S. asset allocation, styles, S&amp;P, sector calls, things of that nature.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mike Larson:</strong> Perfect. Well, appreciate the background. Kind of sets the stage a little bit there. I mean, as we're talking, S&amp;P markets hitting new highs again after a little bit of turbulence in October. It's been quite the run. Where do you see markets as we get into here, deeper into the fourth quarter?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Ed Clissold:</strong> Look. If you get closer to the end of the year, the momentum trade seems to take hold. And I think it applies this year. Some years, it doesn't, but particularly what we've noticed is that there still is a swath of investors who haven't completely gotten back in after the shock of the post Liberation Day meltdown. Most people got it back into some extent, but maybe not fully invested or there's certain hedge fund investors who maybe aren't levered as they had been previously, and so you're going to see some performance chasing, but it's beyond that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the number one thing is that companies have blown estimates out of the water. Some of this is because the analyst community overthought on the downside. And if you can nail it to one thing, it's that they overestimated the impact of tariffs on profit margin, missing how much had been imported beforehand. Well, I think maybe the public was taken aback maybe perhaps by the shock that a lot of the companies playing for it pretty well, but also, if you think about, like, the input cost for companies, or for some companies, what they're importing, their materials are important.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's the biggest input for most companies? People. Yeah. So, that's part of the reason why I think you've seen hiring slowdown is that companies are perhaps you say, we're not going to hire as many people or somebody leaves. We're just not going to replace them. And so, you're not seeing as many layoffs as you would see as you're going into recession, but you're seeing some of them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And so, corporate America has just done a great job, and then you throw on the fact that the Fed is poised to – we're recording this on Tuesday. The Fed's going to announce tomorrow. Pretty high likelihood, they're going to cut again. So, friendly Fed, subdued sentiment, good momentum, strong earnings, pretty good backdrop for stock to do fairly well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mike Larson:</strong> Yeah. Let's talk about the labor issue first of all because, I mean, obviously, the big news this week, Amazon, depending on what media report you look at, anywhere from 14,000 to 30,000 white-collar-type jobs. They're looking at maybe trimming. UPS, blew out the numbers, but a big part of that was, as you mentioned, cuts; thirty-some-odd thousand cuts that they've implemented as part of cost-cutting. Do you think we ever get to a point where that's going to be an issue for Wall Street, or is that more of a Main Street economic issue? And how serious of one going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Ed Clissold:</strong> Yeah. So, first of all, it gets you the K-shaped recovery of the economy, where the high-end consumer is doing really well. And that is the big engine of growth for consumer spending in the U.S. economy, but at some point, it could be too much for the economy to bear, but what -- I think there's a couple of things going on. In the case of -- I don't get into individual companies, but maybe through some of the huge tech companies that hired so much during and right after COVID, there probably still is some normalization of labor force that needs to take place, but others are not.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And what we've seen in particular is the labor force participation rate, which is a mouthful economic term, but it's just who's working and who's looking to work, employed, unemployed. For young workers, 16 to 24, has dropped 2 percentage points year to date. Now, that's a volatile group. They're more sensitive. So, when the economy is slowing, they're going to feel the pinch first, but that's still a pretty big drop. And you've seen that in particular in recent computer science grads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, these poor kids were told to program, and they slogged through four years of programming. Maybe they could have a lot more fun if they are humanities majors and gotten a job, but they didn't. And so, now they're struggling. So, I do think there is something afoot with the economy where companies feel like they can cut some slack, and they expect to be employing AI tools going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And you've seen this in tech. Heard Jamie Dimon talk about that, where they've gotten their AI tool to put together pitch decks that would take a team of junior investment bankers, days to put together, they can put together in a few minutes. I think that is coming. My view in the long run is that the economy will right size itself and will find productive use of that labor. Meantime, it can be, certainly concerning for the people going through it directly, in and of itself probably not enough to cause a recession, but it probably part of why the Fed needs to consider lowering rates in a time when inflation is still sizably above its target.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, put it in the something to be a little worried about category. Wouldn't put it in the time-to-panic zone. For example, we have our recession watch report. There're 10 different indicators in that. We need 6 out of 10 to say you're high risk of recession. Right now there's only one in the recession risk zone. That's ISM services, but unemployment claims, CEO confidence, consumer confidence all well away from where you'd say historically, well, the economy is probably going into recession.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mike Larson:</strong> Got it. So, let's pivot to policy on the assumption the Fed will have cut 25 basis points by the time this airs. Moving forward, what are you looking for? One more meeting in 2025, and then as we roll into 2026, what is your general Fed outlook?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Ed Clissold:</strong> Yeah. I think there's a decent chance they'll cut again in December and then probably a time in early 2026. So, friendly for now, and we've studied it when you had a Fed pause, like, we've had so they cut. They pause for at least six months, and then they resume cutting. That's what happened. They cut in December, waited nine months, cut again in September. The market tends to rally, starting three, four months before the cut, which roughly would happen this time, but I find this interesting. History doesn't repeat, it rhymes, and the fact that there's some consternation around inflation, albeit tariff-induced, right about the time you normally get that during the Fed pauses, and then the rally happened again about the time you would get that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going forward, the rally continues on average, although not quite as strong a pace as it did a few months leading into those Fed cuts. My concern, though, Mike, as we head into next year, is what happens in May. We're going to get a new Fed Chair, and sounds like they may announce the person early. Usually, it's two or three months before we’re in. They're talking about doing it before the end of the year. We'll see. I also think perhaps Trump, he's a master of suspense. Whether you like him or not, he's excellent at this stuff. He may keep that drawn out for longer. But regardless, we're going to get a new Fed Chair. This person is going to know the assignments, which is to keep lowering rates. But by May, if you get another two or more cuts, the Fed's going to be close to neutral. And so, that's going to be a pretty tough decision, I think, for the new Fed Chair.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Do you keep cutting on the expectation that inflation is going to come down and those cuts will be justified? In which case, then, the market may come into play. Do you start seeing inflation expectations rise? Do you start seeing the yield curve steepen more? Do you see credit spreads widen? All these things would suggest that maybe the Fed's making a policy mistake.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, the new Fed Chair could also come on and say, \"Thank you, Mister President, I appreciate the nomination, but now that I'm confirmed, my duty is to the economy. I have a dual mandate,\" and that person can then just live with the Truth Social post just like Powell did. Probably not how it's going to go, but it's possible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There's a derivation of that, or maybe the FOMC. Remember, this isn't just one person making the call. The FOMC could push back. You have to see how that would go. There's lots of ways. But the final thing is, maybe everything does work out. Inflation goes down. Fed cuts. Everybody's happy. I think that's probably unlikely, but the point is, right now, we have some pretty friendly Fed policy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mike Larson:</strong> Yeah. Sometimes things do work out. I'll keep our fingers crossed, right?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Ed Clissold:</strong> Yeah. And when we're using the NDR is, like, I don't try to get too concerned about what might happen in the future. I have all my indicators and data that I'm -- that's where I spend most of my day on. It's boring and stuff, looking at indicators and stuff and trying to figure out where they are right now, but a lot of people want to know what we think might happen, and I think that's on our radar for concern for next year is, one way or the other, Fed policy might not be so market-friendly. And that comes right about the time the presidential cycle in the middle of the mid term year, things tend to be rocky, and so it all could come into play.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mike Larson:</strong> You brought up the economy and markets and conditions at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s. So, I have to ask the question or at least bring it up. With AI, it's in the news every day. Is this a boom? Is it a bubble? Is it Dot-com 2? Is it not? What are your thoughts on that and what it means for an investor? I mean, if you're involved in that sector, you've been investing and made a lot of money. What do you tell clients when they come to you about the outlook there?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Ed Clissold:</strong> Yeah. So, a couple of things. One is, look, the market is concentrated in a way it really never has been before. If you look at the top 10 stocks in the S&amp;P 500, depending on the day, they're roughly 40% of the S&amp;P 500. For perspective, in 2000, they were 10%. I mean, I'm sorry. They were 30%, 10 percentage points lower. Even in the early '70s, the Nifty Fifty bubble era, they were 33%. So, yes, we are beholden to these Mag 7 AI-related companies whether we want to be or not. If you're invested in a cap-weighted index, that's where your money is allocated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, in terms of where we are valuation-wise, so the second point is, if you were to say, look at a trailing price-to-earnings ratio, a forward price-to-earnings ratio, the S&amp;P 500 is trading at near where it was in 2000. But, also, we were here in 2021. Now, we had a pretty nasty bear market in 2022. There wasn't a recession, but saw a 25% decline in the S&amp;P. The point is, you could get a correction of this valuation predicament that we're in without a bubble popping. In fact, I'd argue that would be healthy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you contrast it to 2015, yeah, we had a growth scare, a shallow bear market. Because valuations were so much lower, that was less than 20% decline. Some people wouldn't even say it was a bear market. We classified one NDR because it lasted from May '15 to February '16. That was long enough. But regardless, the decline was much less peak to trough because you started a lower valuation. And so, even a growth scale without recession could lead to a bigger bear market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I got to get to your real point, Mike, on the bubble. Right now, valuations are probably projecting a lot of gains from AI. We could get them, but eventually, we know that the last CapEx dollar spent in a cycle is usually not one well spent at all. And in some ways, this is a classic CapEx environment. And the reason why these Mag 7 companies have been so wonderful is that they're generating all this cash flow, and they return a lot for the shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And they still can return a lot to shareholders, but a lot more is being eaten up by the need to keep spending and growing faster and faster and faster, and they're all spending with each other. It feels like a circle of reference. And so, eventually, somebody's going to jump off the hamster wheel, and maybe everybody goes flying.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of \"Is this the end of the bubble or not?\" As somebody who lived through 1999, it doesn't quite feel that way. And this is less about NDR indicators, more about the sentiment side of things. It really was a period where everybody piled in to just a few name. And this is something -- I've been on my soapbox about this for a few years when people say, oh, the top five stocks account for 60% of the gains of the S&amp;P year to date. Well, that's how it works most years. It's a top-rated index. The biggest stocks that do well account for most of the gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's okay for the generals to lead if the infantry are following. And right now, the infantry are following. Most stocks are trending up. What happened in the late '90s is it really got into a few names. So, in April '98, we hit a shallow bear market peak. We had long-term capital management, Russian ruble crisis. The Fed cut rates a few times, and Greenspan famously got all the bankers in the room and said, \"Well, you made this mess with long-term capital. You fix it.\" And then the market roared out of those October '98 lows, and the Fed then pumped actual liquidity into the system.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Younger people, you may laugh at this. There was real concern everybody's going to take money out of ATMs because of Y2K, and so the Fed put money supply in the system, and money didn't go to the ATM. It went to the Nasdaq. Nasdaq almost doubled. But the average guy didn't -- the Advance Decline line, the running total of advancing stocks versus declining stock, peaked in April 1998. It never, never got above that level through all the 1999 into early 2000. The Value Line Geometric Index, which is an equal weighted composite, how the average stock is doing, likewise peaked in April 1998.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, we haven't seen that. We got a new high in the A/D line just the other day. So, is it possible to bring the conversation about the Fed earlier? So, is it possible that we get the Fed pumping too much into the system, money goes where it's treated best, and that creates an AI bubble from here? Possibly. I just – my final note on the whole bubble discussion is, these things can go on for longer than what anybody thinks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We all know trees don't go to the sky. The economy will not be 90% AI investment. So, eventually, this is going to come to an end. But right now, it doesn't feel like we're at the final throes of the bubble mania.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mike Larson:</strong> Got it. Let me ask you this as we come to the tail end of our conversation. What other sectors -- you mentioned there is a lot more participation in this market. It's not all just tech. If you look at it from a sector breakdown, any other one or two opportunities that you think from your standpoint look particularly attractive here as we get closer to 2026?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Ed Clissold:</strong> So, on a sector basis, right now, we like tech, which obviously in the middle of that AI discussion. We also like utilities, which is somewhat AI-adjacent. It's also a way to maybe get some defensiveness in your portfolio. We have an eye on some of the more cyclical value areas, like materials. With all this focus on re-shoring and manufacturing, you would think that material stocks would participate in that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And recently, they're very volatile, but if they can establish new uptrends, we would do that. The other one we have on our radar, not pulling the trigger on this yet, but it could be getting close, is healthcare. It's recently fallen to its weight in the S&amp;P is below 10% for the first time since the late 1990s, and there's so much negative sentiment around healthcare. This is common after a new president is elected because they always campaign on ideas of shaking up healthcare systems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Certainly, that's what's going on now, but on average, once you get six months or so after the new president takes office, a lot of that bad news is priced in. So, we want to see the momentum turn, but the cheap sector, under-loved, under-owned, could be a place to look going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mike Larson:</strong> Got it. Well, Ed, you're going to be joining us for the MoneyShow Masters Symposium in Sarasota here in December. Great to have you there. Glad you can make it. Just as a brief sneak peek, anything, themes, topics you think you're going to be touching on there for attendees?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Ed Clissold:</strong> So, I've got a lot of questions on. If small caps are going to be -- are finally ready to go, and so we'll probably talk a little bit about that and how growth stocks have continued to beat value stocks. And at NDR, we're really known for our investor sentiment work. We didn't touch on that a whole lot. I'd love to dive into the details about what's going on within sentiment, what part of the markets are showing frothiness and which ones are not.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mike Larson:</strong> Perfect. Ed, thank you so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Ed Clissold:</strong> Appreciate the time, and looking forward to catching up in person.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Originally published on <a href=\"https://www.moneyshow.com/articles/podcast-64550/moneymasters-podcast-10-30-25-could-ai-investments-backfire-in-2026/\" rel=\"noopener\">MoneyShow.com</a></em></p>",

This was the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKTA/earnings\">20th consecutive double-beat</a> quarter, highlighting consistent performance and excellent execution by management. The market reacted with a roughly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKTA/historical-price-quotes\">2%</a> appreciation in the stock price over the following trading day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The cybersecurity company delivered $728 million in revenue, indicating a nearly 13% increase over the past 12 months, and $16 million above analysts' estimates. The bottom-line arrived at $0.91 in diluted EPS, about a 22% increase versus $0.72 in the same quarter last year, and $0.06 above analysts' forecasts. These results underscored a continuation in the top and bottom-line growth, which deserves a premium valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618249173627672_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1133\" data-height=\"635\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618249173627672_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"OKTA: FQ2 2026 Key Highlights\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618249173627672_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618249173627672_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618249173627672_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618249173627672_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618249173627672_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618249173627672_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618249173627672_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618249173627672_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">OKTA: FQ2 2026 Key Highlights <span>(Okta Investor Relations)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management highlighted that it achieved approximately 20,000 total customers. About 5,000 of them are spending more than $100,000, indicating high-quality services leading to a sticky customer base. I think this is extremely important and justifies a bullish narrative for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The cybersecurity firm is also collaborating with other companies in the landscape to deliver innovative solutions and market-leading services for clients. For instance, on July 15, Okta announced an <a href=\"https://investor.okta.com/news-and-events/news-releases/news-details/2025/Okta-and-Palo-Alto-Networks-Unify-AI-Driven-Security-to-Fight-Identity-Attacks/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">expanded partnership</a> on new integrations with Palo Alto Networks to offer a unified security solution for their joint customers. This supports a bullish stance, highlighting a customer-focused business strategy, which may lead to higher consumer spending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management underlined the importance of its products. The security solutions appear to be a critical foundation for connection among users and technology. They cover cloud, security, and digital transformation. I think there is a significant necessity for cybersecurity products to take into account AI-related threats. To that, management highlighted Okta's end-to-end security solutions, offering visibility, governance, and remediation, and identifying non-human identities. I think that AI development presents a key tailwind for the company. Given its dominant stance in the identity and access management market, if Okta can sustain its leading position, it should be one of the key beneficiaries of the broader market growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to the following tailwind, the identity and access management market was valued at roughly <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/identity-and-access-management-iam\" rel=\"nofollow\">$13 billion</a> in 2022, and is expected to triple in size over the following years to about $42 billion by 2030. This represents a 12.6% CAGR, and supports a bullish narrative for the stock. Okta is estimated to have about <a href=\"https://6sense.com/tech/identity-access-management/okta-market-share\" rel=\"nofollow\">41%</a> market share in this landscape, which supports my thesis that if the company can sustain its dominant position, it is likely to benefit from broader market expansion leading to significant top and bottom-line growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618260236654372_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1134\" data-height=\"636\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618260236654372_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"OKTA: One Unified Identity Solution\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618260236654372_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618260236654372_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618260236654372_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618260236654372_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618260236654372_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618260236654372_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618260236654372_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618260236654372_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">OKTA: One Unified Identity Solution <span>(Okta Investor Relations)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the <a href=\"https://s205.q4cdn.com/566291348/files/doc_financials/2026/q2/FINAL-Okta-Q2FY26-Earnings-Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">presentation</a>, management highlighted strong non-GAAP, which has been sustained at above an 80% level. The company underscored that subscription gross margin has reached 83.7% in the quarter, and that has slightly exceeded a total gross margin of 81.5%.

Wall Street is anticipating approximately $730 million in revenue, implying roughly 10% growth on a year-over-year basis. The market is expecting $0.75 in diluted EPS, which would signal nearly 13% growth versus the same quarter last year. This would represent a continuation of double-digit expansion, marking significant performance and market dominance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that the company may be able to achieve these results. The company faces significant tailwinds tied to AI-related demand and threats related to the rapid development of the technology. Security in the connection between users and technology appears to be a necessity, and Okta is one of the key leaders in the segment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Okta Appears To Be Undervalued, Tied To Double-Digit Growth, And Phenomenal Margins</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The cybersecurity company currently trades at a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKTA/valuation/metrics\">forward P/E of 26.03</a>, and although that presents a 2% premium to peers at 25.51, and roughly a 10% overvaluation compared to the average company in the S&amp;P 500 at <a href=\"https://en.macromicro.me/series/20052/sp500-forward-pe-ratio\" rel=\"nofollow\">23.62</a>, I argue that the stock may be cheap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-1761827302748082.png?io=w640\" alt=\"OKTA: Forward P/E\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"624\" height=\"410\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-1761827302748082.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-1761827302748082.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-1761827302748082.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-1761827302748082.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-1761827302748082.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-1761827302748082.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-1761827302748082.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-1761827302748082.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">OKTA: Forward P/E <span>(YCharts)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The chart above highlights a significant correction the company faced from multiple perspectives since the beginning of 2024. Given this, I think that the sell-off may appear overdone, and the stock could rebound from these levels. This also reflects a multi-year low valuation, supporting that downside may be limited.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a forward PEG (non-GAAP) basis of 1.53, the company appears undervalued, highlighting about a 15% discount to the sector median of 1.82. This supports my bullish thesis, indicating an undervalued level. On the other hand, the forward EV/Sales and Price/Sales ratios of 4.69 and 5.36, respectively, balance the bullish outlook and argue that Okta may actually be trading at a significant premium. These valuation metrics imply a 40% premium at the midpoint, which may weigh on the stock price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, these metrics may actually suggest that the market has partially priced in the company's future growth. If that is the case, although it continues growing at a double-digit pace, it may not necessarily result in the stock price appreciation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618286388807569_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"871\" data-height=\"215\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618286388807569_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"OKTA: Capital Structure\" width=\"640\" height=\"158\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618286388807569_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618286388807569_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618286388807569_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618286388807569_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618286388807569_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618286388807569_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618286388807569_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618286388807569_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">OKTA: Capital Structure <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the upside, the company appears to be a low-leveraged business, and that is a significant argument for a bullish continuation. The company has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKTA/valuation/capital-structure\">$940 million</a> in total obligations. Okta has $2.86 billion in cash and could pay its debt with ease. This appears appealing, as it leaves financial flexibility for management to use debt-related instruments, if that's needed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The software company has been a phenomenal revenue growth story, so far. Over the past 12 months, it has grown its top-line by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKTA/growth\">12.68%</a>, reflecting a 76% advantage versus peers at 7.19%. The forward revenue growth rate of 11.72% indicates that the trend of top-line expansion is likely to continue. This revenue growth appears to be roughly 30% higher than the average company in the S&amp;P 500, at about <a href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/5748/sp-500-revenue-ttm\" rel=\"nofollow\">10%</a>, which argues for a higher valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The diluted EPS growth rate of 31% implies roughly a 2.7x premium versus the sector median of around 12%. This highlights that if the trend of business expansion continues, the company may appear even more compelling in the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618290617333193.png?io=w640\" alt=\"OKTA: Net Income (TTM)\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"623\" height=\"407\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618290617333193.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618290617333193.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618290617333193.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618290617333193.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618290617333193.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618290617333193.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618290617333193.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618290617333193.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">OKTA: Net Income (TTM) <span>(YCharts)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Okta operates at substantially above-market margins, fueling a bullish narrative. Gross profit margin (TTM) of roughly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKTA/profitability\">77%</a> implies a 55% premium versus peers at around 50%. The net income margin (TTM) of 6.08% represents nearly a 37% advantage versus the industry's average of 4.45%. This supports my stance, highlighting that Okta is a highly profitable company, operating at premium margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the company trades at industry-like valuations, although it grows top and bottom line at a more rapid pace. It remains a low-leveraged business, offering substantial margins. Okta is also tied to significant tailwinds related to the identity and access management market growth, and it has a dominant stance, which is likely to be sustained over the following years, because of innovative products and customer expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wall Street <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKTA/earnings/estimates\">anticipates</a> a $3.37 diluted EPS estimate for fiscal FY2026, highlighting a roughly 20% growth over the past 12 months. For fiscal FY2027, analysts expect $3.61 in diluted EPS, representing a 7% growth. I think the company can achieve such results, which would reflect a continuation in the demand, and are in line with the broader market expectations for the identity and access management market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, I believe that the market may rethink the thesis around Okta. Given AI-related threats, I think investor confidence may improve, and that could result in a higher premium for the software company. This is why I think that a 30x earnings multiple would be reasonable, justified by phenomenal margins and double-digit top and bottom line growth. If we apply a $3.61 fiscal FY2027 estimate to this earnings multiple, we arrive at my price target of $108, implying a 22% upside possibility. I think that the forward-looking markets may start pricing in sooner rather than later, and Okta may return to a more business-typical valuation level.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Main Risks And Concerns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are risks and concerns tied to Okta that could meaningfully impact the stock price performance in the short term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The identity and access management landscape appears to be highly competitive. Although Okta has a significant market share, pressure from Microsoft, and its Entra ID, CyberArk, and other companies could create fierce competition, and consumers may choose other alternatives. This could result in weaker-than-anticipated revenue growth or lower margins, which could weigh on the stock price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is tied to security and data breach risks. As it is a cybersecurity name, any sort of breach could meaningfully impact its reputation, and that could be a significant challenge to outweigh. It also may lead to a financial impact, which could stress the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Okta is also exposed to the macroeconomic headwinds. If IT-related spending slows down, the company could not experience a double-digit growth, and that could impact investor sentiment. This is an area to monitor for investors, whether IT-related companies face any slowdown in demand that could raise flags, and for Okta's business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, if none of the above materializes, Okta appears to be well-positioned to sustain its dominant position and benefit from broader market growth. I think it could appear a compelling opportunity for long-term investors who may be seeking a diversification into a high-margin landscape at a compelling valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Okta Offers A Compelling Opportunity Into A High-Demand, High-Margin Market</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe the software company offers an appealing opportunity to expand exposure to a high-demand, high-margin market. It remains a dominant player in the landscape, which argues for a bullish continuation. The cybersecurity market of identity and access management is expected to grow, following threats tied to AI expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Okta appears to be trading at a fairly valued price, yet I argue that it actually is cheap. It grows both top and bottom lines at a double-digit pace, operates at substantially above-market margins, and remains a low-leverage business, which fuels a bullish outlook. It faces fierce competition that could impact market share and margins, but with innovative products and meaningful partnerships, it appears to be well-positioned to sustain its positive stance.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is why I think Okta is a Buy with a $108 price target over the next 12 months. This suggests a 22% upside possibility, underscoring the likelihood of broader market outperformance. 42 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKTA/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">Wall Street analysts</a> forecast a roughly $121 price over the next year, implying 38% upside potential. This is possible, yet I favor a more conservative approach.</p>",

The air taxi company has pushed the service as a future opportunity towards the end of the decade with the potential to remove the cost of the pilot from a flight and add another paying passenger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Joby Aviation just <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509805-joby-aviation-shares-soar-after-teaming-up-with-nvidia-to-advance-autonomous-flight-tech\">announced plans</a> to work with <strong>Nvidia</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) on the development of autonomous flight technology using their IGX Thor compute platform integrated into \"Superpilot\" technology for civil and military platforms. The collaboration promoted the concept of accelerating autonomous aviation without providing any concrete plans or goals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The eVTOL partner is listed as the only aviation launch partner, but Nvidia already works with tons of companies working on autonomous vehicles. The AI compute giant is focused on platforms that can be widely adopted, not restrictive partnerships.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Besides, Joby Aviation <a href=\"https://www.jobyaviation.com/news/joby-acquires-xwing-autonomy-division/\" rel=\"nofollow\">bought</a> Xwing last year to acquire the Superpilot software to advance autonomous flying plans. Xwing had already completed 250 fully autonomous flights and more than 500 auto-landings prior to the deal, which was over a year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the start of September, Joby Aviation <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4491703-joby-aviation-remotely-pilots-cessna-in-pentagon-push-for-autonomous-aircraft\">remotely piloted</a> a Cessna 208 aircraft. The company logged over 7,000 miles in the demonstration test, though the flights were remotely piloted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, Joby Aviation shouldn't rally based on autonomous plans. The company must obtain FAA certification and successfully launch an air taxi service in New York by manufacturing certified aircraft before autonomous flying turns into a focus.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Focus On eVTOL Certification</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The vastly more important story for Joby Aviation is the plans to fly piloted tests on Type Inspection Authorization (TIA) aircraft. At the time of the Q2 earnings call in August, the aircraft manufacturer was working on completing the assembly of the first of 5 aircraft to be used in FAA certification testing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Joby Aviation will report Q3 earnings on November 5 and the whole focus will be on aircraft certification, not autonomous flights. About 3 months ago, the company had reached 70% certification of Stage 4 testing with some progress on Stage 5.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1526\" data-height=\"588\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"247\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/234751-1761848355617991_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Joby Aviation Q3'25 shareholder letter</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4809921-joby-aviation-inc-joby-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q2'25 earnings call</a>, the CEO outlined the flight testing plan as follows:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>During this stage, Joby and FAA pilots will fly our aircraft to validate all of our certification work ahead of receiving a type certification. And I'm pleased to say, as we announced this morning, the first of 5 aircraft for TIA flight testing is headed to final assembly, and we remain on track to <em>start flying our TIA aircraft with Joby pilots this year and to begin TIA certification flights with FAA pilots early next year.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Along with the announced deal with RAKTA in the UAE, Joby Aviation released that flight testing had topped 40,000 miles. The company should've logged far more test miles over the last month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company recently <a href=\"https://ir.jobyaviation.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/152/joby-aviation-announces-closing-of-underwritten-offering-of\" rel=\"nofollow\">raised another $591 </a><span>million</span> by selling 35 million shares at $16.85 per share. Joby Aviation pushed the pro-forma Q3 ending cash balance of around $1.5 billion. The company ended Q2 with a cash hoard of $991 million, and the company likely burned $120+ million during the last quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock has now seen the market cap reach $15 billion. Joby Aviation bought Blade Air Mobility's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4477164-joby-confirms-buying-blades-urban-air-mobility-passenger-business-for-125m\">passenger business</a> in the last quarter with a revenue run rate in the $105 million range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Joby Aviation won't report any eVTOL revenues for a few more quarters, at least. The UAM business from Blade won't change the valuation equation much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is still years away from being a $1+ billion business worthy of a $15 billion market cap. The stock continues to struggle moving above the $17 to $20 range due to stretched valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key investor takeaway is that Joby Aviation is leading the push into air taxi services around the globe. The company is on the verge of final testing with the FAA for aircraft certification, but the business has a long path to material revenues.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors should avoid buying the stock up here and possibly lock in some profits with the potential to re-acquire shares at lower prices.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UUUU\" title=\"Energy Fuels Inc.\">UUUU</a></span>) is a Colorado-based, leading U.S. mining company focused on the extraction, development, and sale of Uranium. The company is the largest provider of U.S. uranium. Energy Fuels is in the process of diversifying its operations by<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> expanding into new products, including other rare earth materials, and medical isotopes, as part of a strategy to capitalise on the growing demand for these critical materials.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With its controlling position in the uranium market and ongoing diversification efforts, Energy Fuels has seen its share price rocket over the course of the past year. This article will explore the factors behind this explosive growth and dive into the outlook of the company ahead of its earnings report.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Rating Snapshot</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Energy Fuels offers the potential for long-term upside but is dependent on rising uranium prices, increased production efficiency, and the success of their expansion into other business lines. Their upcoming earnings will be a key checkpoint on how the company is progressing in these areas. However, current revenue contribution is minimal during their inventory build-up and diversification efforts. This makes forecasting difficult, as returns are largely based upon the price of uranium, which is hard to predict due to its illiquid and politically sensitive nature. Given the uncertainties, I view Energy Fuels as a hold - strong potential, but has to back up its ambitious production targets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Company Overview</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Energy Fuels is currently in a period of strategic inventory retention, where instead of selling, they are opting to hold the majority of their produced uranium. This puts Energy Fuels in a position to capitalise if - as they predict - market prices strengthen. This approach reflects a deliberate strategy to maximise long-term value, even if at the expense of short-term revenue. By operating with this unique strategy, Energy Fuels experiences virtually no sales, rendering many of the traditional valuation measures useless. So how can investors interpret their upcoming earnings?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The focus instead should shift to other key areas that reveal the company’s underlying performance: Production metrics, which indicate operational progress; cash and liquidity, which show the level of financial stability during this holding period; and the performance of strategic investments, particularly in rare earths, and medical isotopes, which represent Energy Fuels next phase of growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Production Metrics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Arguably the most important factor that will determine the outcome of earnings is the production metrics. In the first half of the year, <a href=\"https://investors.energyfuels.com/2025-08-06-Energy-Fuels-Announces-Q2-2025-Results\" rel=\"noopener\">Energy Fuels produced</a> ~330,000 pounds of uranium, and set guidance of a total mining of 875,000 to 1,435,000 pounds for the entirety of 2025, so anything greater than ~350,000 pounds would signal strong operational momentum. In combination with further guidance refining this previous production estimate, we will get a clear idea on whether Energy Fuels is in a good position to deliver toward the upper end of expectations or if momentum has tapered off. Equally important are the production costs, previous guidance from management <a href=\"https://investors.energyfuels.com/2025-08-06-Energy-Fuels-Announces-Q2-2025-Results\" rel=\"nofollow\">forecast production costs</a> of uranium to drop to $23 - $30/Ib by Q4, down from an average of $53/Ib for existing inventory. Getting closer towards this target region would significantly strengthen future profitability. These key factors are expected to be the main focus of earnings for investors and will determine Energy Fuels ability to justify its recent share price performance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash and Liquidity</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q2, Energy Fuels operated with a debt-free balance sheet, however, this position is subject to significant change following the $700 million convertible senior notes offering, which was upsized from an initial $500 million – a sign of market confidence in the company's long term strategy. These were issued at a modest 0.75% coupon through 2031 with favourable conversion terms, giving Energy Fuels access to low cost capital without immediate dilution. Proceeds will improve Energy Fuels liquidity, giving them flexibility to continue to advance their key growth initiatives, whilst maintaining solid financial support during periods of market volatility. For interpreting upcoming earnings, the focus should be on how effectively this fresh capital is being allocated, not short-term profitability. There should be a particular focus on the investment of this capital into value driving projects and on sustaining strong cash reserves during this strategic inventory holding phase.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strategic Investments Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Energy Fuels diversification strategy is beginning to take shape across its rare earth and medical isotope segments, each offering the company future growth prospects beyond uranium. In rare earths, the company is continuing to gather momentum at their White Mesa Mill facility, producing high purity mixed rare earth carbonate and light earth oxides. Investors should watch for updates on operational scale and efficiency, particularly any progress comments made on their production facilities. On top of this, any contract announcements would show signs of Energy Fuels commercial readiness and begin to reveal what we can expect from them in the upcoming years. Another key update could come surrounding the development of medical isotopes - used in cancer therapies - which could open up another valuable revenue stream. Both the rare earths and medical isotopes demonstrate a large degree of potential to strengthen Energy Fuels positioning as a diversified critical materials supplier.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Analyst Consensus</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Energy Fuels is a small-cap company with limited analyst coverage, current projections provide useful context for expectations. Analysts covering Energy Fuels have an average <a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/UUUU/analysis/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">price target</a> of around $22, approximately 10% above the current share price. This suggests the market is cautiously optimistic, reflecting potential upside from uranium price appreciation and the company’s strategic diversification into rare earths and medical isotopes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given Energy Fuels inventory retention strategy, near-term revenue may be muted, so analysts are likely emphasizing operational execution, cost efficiency, and progress in diversification initiatives over short-term earnings. Any updates on uranium production volumes, mill throughput, or rare earth and isotope development could influence market sentiment and price performance relative to consensus targets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Uranium</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we covered, uranium remains the main component of Energy Fuels, so the company’s share price is naturally closely tied to the spot price of uranium. What, then, does the future look like for this commodity?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, uranium is sitting at around $80/Ib with analysts forecasting <a href=\"https://www.devere-group.com/uranium-price-forecast-to-rise-in-2025-amid-nuclear-game-changer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">potential rises</a> to $90-$100/Ib in the near term. The key reason for this projected price rise is the increase in demand for uranium over the coming years. This is coming from the U.S. government's push for nuclear energy, where the Department of Energy (DOE) is expanding its uranium reserve; Global reactor restarts, where demand for uranium reactors is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/uranium-demand-set-surge-28-by-2030-nuclear-power-gains-momentum-wna-says-2025-09-05/\" rel=\"nofollow\">expected to grow</a> ~28% by 2030 and more than double by 2040; ESG / clean energy narrative, as nuclear power is increasingly viewed as a low-carbon, reliable complement to renewables, making it more attractive in the clean energy transition.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Uranium Spot Price vs Share Price</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The graph below shows a strong correlation between the spot price of uranium and the share price of Energy Fuels, where they have followed a nearly identical path up until recently, when Energy Fuels share price has shot up relative to uranium. So what is driving this disconnect?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"752\" data-height=\"452\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Strong correlation between uranium spot price and Energy Fuel Inc Share Price\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60822562-17617858548903813_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Excel</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data from Cameco &amp; Yahoo Finance</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see <strong>3 key factors</strong> contributing to this deviation from the spot price:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Import bans: In recent years a large share of uranium imports into the U.S. have come from Russia, but, a recent legislation passed in the U.S. is banning all low-enriched uranium imports from Russia. This rule is currently being implemented and is planned to be fully phased in by 2028. This shrinking of supply will naturally increase the price of uranium for U.S. based operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Diversification: Energy Fuels plans to move into the rare earth elements space as well as the medical isotopes industry over the next couple of years, which opens up greater revenue streams for Energy Fuels while limiting their exposure to fluctuations in the price of uranium. We can expect to see their uranium revenue share begin to drop over the next few years, and investors are willing to pay a premium for this reduction in risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Debt issuance: Finally, as discussed earlier in the article, Energy Fuels recently raised $700 million through a convertible senior notes offering with interest at 0.75%, giving Energy Fuels capital to expand at a cheap rate. Initially, Energy Fuel aimed to raise $500 million, but due to large demand, the offering quickly raised to $600 million and then ultimately $700 million, signaling strong investor demand and confidence in the firm's outlook. Energy Fuel also used a portion of these proceeds to enter a capped call transaction, designed to mitigate potential share dilution should the share price increase significantly. This type of hedge shows strong financial management and reinforces the reputation amongst investors as a company that prioritises shareholder protection.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Energy Fuels is well-positioned as a leading U.S. uranium producer with early-stage diversification into rare earths and medical isotopes. Their strategic inventory retention and their shrinking production cost provide upside if uranium prices rise, while recent capital inflows improve their financial flexibility. However, near-term revenue may remain slight, and growth from diversification is still in early stages. Overall, the company offers long-term growth potential but remains execution and commodity-price dependent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, the company is a wait-and-see; they have set some pretty ambitious production quantity and price targets, which, if they hit, would be huge for the company. However, if they fall short, investors may begin to lose faith in the company - especially considering their limited sales - triggering a sell-off. To sum up, these earnings could swing the company either way to a pretty significant degree. It is a classic high-risk, high-reward speculation-based investment at the moment.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me know your thoughts ahead of earnings on Monday!</p>",
