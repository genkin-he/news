The most critical factor is charging time. AC chargers require a vehicle’s onboard converter to change from AC to DC. In contrast, DC chargers can convert power inside the station and send it directly to the EV battery. This can juice an EV to 80% in under an hour compared to about 4-10 hours for AC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48014573-17720014957312467_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"769\" data-height=\"627\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48014573-17720014957312467_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Share of Public DC and AC Chargers\" width=\"640\" height=\"522\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48014573-17720014957312467_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48014573-17720014957312467_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48014573-17720014957312467_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48014573-17720014957312467_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Share of Public DC and AC Chargers <span>(THE INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL ON CLEAN TRANSPORTATION)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second factor is range anxiety. While AC chargers are installed in residential and workplace settings, DC chargers serve en route locations such as highways and urban hubs, where faster charging directly addresses range anxiety. In the US, the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program had allocated $5 billion to build DC charging networks along highways. But these didn’t exactly pan out amidst <a href=\"https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/trump-reopen-nevi-funding\" rel=\"noopener\">opposition</a> from the federal government last year. Regardless, I think the trendline remains clear. Just a few days ago, Nayax signed an <a href=\"https://www.nayax.com/news/nayax-tritium-global-ev-charger-payment-partnership/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">agreement</a> with Tritium, a DC charging manufacturer, to integrate its payment hardware across a charging network spanning over 50 countries.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>So we're seeing a high demand. Q4 is always -- is a big enterprise, and we have a very, very good visibility to end this quarter with the expectation that we set to the market. - Yair Nechmad, CEO of Nayax at 3Q25 Results</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q3, management also <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845608-nayax-ltd-nyax-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">mentioned</a> an acceleration in enterprise sales. The impact of enterprise mix on margins was not explicitly mentioned. However, they appeared confident in staying in the higher end of 30%-35% hardware margins, which I think implies that enterprise sales are consistent with and not dilutive to those higher margins. A combination of these factors and the fact that companies tend to <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sandbag.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">sandbag</a> expectations leads me to believe that the company will likely continue to affirm its 2028 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800637-nayax-sticky-bet-in-a-growing-market\">targets</a> in its last quarter earnings.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48014573-17720918856865997_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1696\" data-height=\"745\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48014573-17720918856865997_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Target Price v P/FCF Multiple\" width=\"640\" height=\"281\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48014573-17720918856865997_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48014573-17720918856865997_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48014573-17720918856865997_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48014573-17720918856865997_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>Target Price vs. P/FCF Multiple <span>(Tunga Capital)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the company’s 2028 targets still intact, not much has changed in terms of my target range. But I also think the edge in valuation disappears if the market perceives the discount rate as being structurally higher to account for AI risks. Unfortunately, this isn’t a company issue but a macro issue, which makes the stock behave like a long-duration asset. Because of this factor, I thought the stock could keep drifting in and out of the first two regimes below.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td>Regime</td> <td>Fair Value</td> <td>Interpretation</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Execution + normal discount rate</td> <td>~$66–$78</td> <td>Moderate upside</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Execution + high discount rate</td> <td>~$46 - $50</td> <td>Fairly valued</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Execution miss</td> <td>&lt;$40</td> <td>Real downside</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the execution remains on course and discount rates normalize, there is meaningful upside. If the discount rate remains high, the equity drifts sideways. Only under conditions of weak execution does the thesis break decisively. So a market-perform or hold rating makes sense for a macro call on a fundamentally improving business.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operationally, Nayax is at its strongest point, and the company's growth levers are structurally sound. For the investor who bought at a $44 price point, the stock has offered a decent return in a short period of time. This is especially true if you managed to sell at the $60 highs seen last month.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I continue to like the company. I am just a little less enthusiastic about the entry point where the broader market is compressing multiples and is demanding faster resolution of growth stories. A pullback to the mid-40s without a clear operational reason would provide a higher margin of safety to accumulate. Otherwise, I expect the stock to move in line with market sentiments in the near term.</p>",

The tech stocks that<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> have powered much of the market's dizzying ascent over the past few years are mostly in deep correction territory.

Since then, Shake Shack has enjoyed a meaningful uptrend even as the rest of the stock market has floundered. Amid healthy guidance looking ahead to FY26, amid the company noting that sales trends have improved materially in the early part of Q1, I'm reiterating my <strong>buy </strong>rating on Shake Shack.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well positioned for success in 2026, with reasonable valuation against a robust outlook</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, there are two core catalysts that Shake Shack can count as tailwinds in the upcoming year. The first is that the company continues to expand into new international markets via licensing deals. In Q4, the company grew its sales from licensed locations by 26% y/y to $232.7 million, which is 38% of the company's systemwide sales of $618 million. Licensing fee revenue (Shake Shack's cut of these sales) grew 28% y/y to $15.3 million, still a small 4% slice of overall sales - and yet, it's also a \"free\", high-margin revenue stream that allows Shake Shack to substantially expand its brand presence with low capital needs and low risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-1772171946078615_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"908\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-1772171946078615_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shake Shack licensed openings\" width=\"640\" height=\"568\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"568\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-1772171946078615_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-1772171946078615_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-1772171946078615_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-1772171946078615_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shake Shack licensed openings <span>(Shake Shack Q4 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the past few months alone, the company has opened locations in Hong Kong, Philippines, Shanghai, Canada, Israel, Korea, and others - as shown above. The company expects to open 40-45 new licensed locations in FY26, representing meaningful growth from its current base of 286 licensed stores. This stacks on top of 55-60 planned company-owned and operated locations, marking 2026 as a meaningful year for Shake Shack's brand expansion: both in the U.S. and overseas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other core catalyst for investors to keep in mind is the fact that within the company's owned and operated portfolio, Shake Shack is getting the hang of more efficient operations. Whereas many restaurant chains are getting bogged down by higher labor costs, Shake Shack has overhauled its labor model to reduce labor costs (as a percentage of revenue), helping to offset the impacts of beef price inflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673438461943_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"970\" data-height=\"310\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673438461943_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shake Shack labor trends\" width=\"640\" height=\"205\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"205\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673438461943_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673438461943_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673438461943_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673438461943_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shake Shack labor trends <span>(Shake Shack Q4 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This has allowed the company to keep growing adjusted EBITDA at a double-digit pace, even as its new restaurant openings are just at the point of maturing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite its many growth catalysts, Shake Shack continues to trade at very reasonable valuations. At current share prices near $99, Shake Shack commands a market cap of $4.21 billion. Netting off the $360.1 million of cash and $247.7 million of debt on Shake Shack's most recent balance sheet, the company's resulting enterprise value is $4.10 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For FY26, Shake Shack is guiding to $1.60-$1.70 billion of revenue, or 14% midpoint revenue growth, with 55-60 company-owned openings stacking on top of low single-digit same-shack sales (comp sales) growth, both contributing to double-digit top line expansion. The company is also expecting restaurant-level margins of 23.0-23.5%, representing up to one point of full-year expansion versus a 22.6% margin in FY25. Adjusted EBITDA, at a midpoint of $241 million, represents a 14.6% margin (+10bps y/y) and 15% y/y growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673558362806_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"770\" data-height=\"932\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673558362806_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shake Shack outlook\" width=\"640\" height=\"775\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"775\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673558362806_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673558362806_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673558362806_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673558362806_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shake Shack outlook <span>(Shake Shack Q4 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shake Shack's valuation is positioned at 17.0x EV/FY26 adjusted EBITDA.

The core driver of acceleration was the addition of 15 new company-owned Shacks in Q4, as well as 17 net-new licensed locations. As previously mentioned, though licensing revenue is still a small ~4% slice of overall revenue, the 28% y/y growth rate here (plus the plan to grow licensed locations by another ~16% in FY26) makes this an incredibly high-margin growth lever for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, the most important metric for us to watch here is same-shack sales growth (which other restaurants refer to as \"same restaurant sales\" or \"comp sales\" and measures revenue growth from existing locations, without including the contribution of newly opened locations).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673949769619_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1672\" data-height=\"1140\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673949769619_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shake Shack SSS trends\" width=\"640\" height=\"436\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"436\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673949769619_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673949769619_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673949769619_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721673949769619_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shake Shack SSS trends <span>(Shake Shack Q4 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The good news is that same-shack sales continued on a recent positive trend, up 2.1% y/y with 160bps of price increases and a favorable menu mix further buoyed by 50bps of y/y traffic increase. This is the company's second consecutive quarter of positive traffic, after y/y declines earlier in the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bad news is that comps decelerated from ~5% growth in Q3. The major headwind here remains the company's core New York City market, where same-shack sales declined -2% y/y. That said, the company noted adverse weather impacts as driving declines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We note as well that deceleration is more the rule rather than the exception in the industry. Burger King (BK), arguably the company's largest pure-play competitor, though leaning in the fast food space instead of \"fast casual,\" saw comps decelerate to 5.8%, from 6.4% in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721674435400753_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1974\" data-height=\"556\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721674435400753_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Burger King comps trends\" width=\"640\" height=\"180\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"180\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721674435400753_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721674435400753_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721674435400753_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721674435400753_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Burger King comps trends <span>(Restaurant Brands Q4 results)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, Mediterranean chain CAVA barely grew comps at all, decelerating 140bps sequentially to 0.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167489951108.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CAVA comps trends\" width=\"610\" height=\"402\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"610\" data-height=\"402\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167489951108.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167489951108.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167489951108.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CAVA comps trends <span>(CAVA Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, we are beginning to see the market make an apparent shift toward promotion-oriented fast food brands. McDonald's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD\" title=\"McDonald's Corporation\">MCD</a>) had the most successful Q4 of most restaurant chains, with U.S. comps accelerating to 6.8% in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, we do think Shake Shack, especially with its chef-driven roots and higher quality, maintains a clear distinction versus fast food burgers. We're also encouraged by the fact that Shake Shack noted January comps improved to over 4%, indicating that Q1 same-shack sales may be positioned to recover back to Q3 levels. Per CEO Robert Lynch's remarks on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875347-shake-shack-inc-shak-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 earnings call:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>Finally, I would like to give some color on our strong start to the year. January same-Shack sales grew 4.3% year-over-year. Despite meaningful weather headwinds in January, we've nevertheless generated solid sales growth, fueled by continued traction in our in-app value platform, increased hours of operations in our Shacks and the launch of compelling culinary innovation.</p> <p>Our start to the year, coupled with the leadership team that we now have in place, gives me unwavering confidence that our plan is working.\"</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, Shake Shack's adjusted EBITDA margins remained roughly flat y/y at 14.0%, with adjusted EBITDA rising 20% y/y to $56.1 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167411895772_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1654\" data-height=\"652\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167411895772_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shake Shack adjusted EBITDA\" width=\"640\" height=\"252\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"252\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167411895772_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167411895772_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167411895772_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-1772167411895772_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shake Shack adjusted EBITDA <span>(Shake Shack Q4 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is still facing headwinds from higher food costs, particularly in beef. On top of this, a rising mix of Shake Shack's sales are via delivery platforms, increasing commission payments. However, the company's labor model, plus its gradual tilting toward smaller formats (which are both cheaper to run on an ongoing basis and cost $2 million to build, a 20% y/y reduction in startup costs), have helped the company to offset the impacts of inflation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks and key takeaways</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, there are risks here that we need to keep in mind. As previously mentioned, McDonald's has been continuing to take more market share with positive U.S. comps in the second half of 2025, reflecting a consumer that is increasingly tilting to promotional deals. Though Shake Shack and McDonald's sit in different dining categories, we note that Shake Shack may feel more pressure to drive more promotions in order to appeal to a cash-strapped consumer. This is stacked on top of the risk of rising beef prices, which the company expects to continue inflating at a high single digit pace in 2026 (partially offset by lower paper and packaging costs).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, I see more positives than risks in this stock, especially at a lower valuation multiple than most fast-casual peers and the strong signal from re-accelerating January same-shack sales. Stay long here.</p>",

Some investors pay a premium for a stock that behaves in such a predictable way, not that further increases will necessarily occur.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, past performance is one of the few available tools by which we can assess a company’s future performance. Based on this history, I would argue ExlService has an excellent management team that knows how to profitably grow a company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, it seems unlikely past performance chased away investors. The chart and history also suggest this is a Buy, not a Sell, stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Expectations</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors also become bearish when they have dim expectations for future performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But that likely is not the case here. In the Q4 earnings report, CEO Rohit Kapoor said, “EXL’s recognized industry expertise and leadership in embedding AI in our clients’ businesses are resonating strongly with the market and fueling our growth with new and existing clients. Our investments in building innovative data and AI services and solutions, growing our partner ecosystem, and cultivating AI-native talent are driving our growth momentum and creating differentiated outcomes for our clients.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking further ahead, the Wall Street analysts see double-digit earnings increases for 2026 and beyond:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/24320523-1772126570084664_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2790\" data-height=\"902\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/24320523-1772126570084664_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EXLS EPS estimates table\" width=\"640\" height=\"207\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"207\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/24320523-1772126570084664_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/24320523-1772126570084664_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/24320523-1772126570084664_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/24320523-1772126570084664_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EXLS EPS estimates <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The analysts have pulled back their estimates for this year and next year since the latest earnings were published.

It is possible some investors may have bought Genpact and Maximus instead, but overall it seems unlikely to have contributed much to the slump.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The warning</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a red banner from the Quant system: “Warning: EXLS is at high risk of performing badly.” To that, it added the Quant system gives it a Sell rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Quant system explained its reasons, “ExlService Holdings, Inc. has characteristics that have been historically associated with poor future stock performance. EXLS has decelerating momentum and declining growth when compared to other Industrials stocks, to the point that it gets a Sell rating from our Quant rating system.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, it is concerned about slowing momentum and declining growth—when compared to other Industrials stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Momentum is obviously a reflection of price movements, and for some time now, the movement has been down. But, if I am right in arguing the price will eventually catch up to earnings, momentum will reverse. Again, we do not know when.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second warning is for declining growth when compared with other Industrials stocks. But it takes only a quick look at other Seeking Alpha data to see that is not the case. On a current basis, EXLS beats the sector medians on all the metrics shown here and on others not shown:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-17713900839895232_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2244\" data-height=\"916\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-17713900839895232_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EXLS growth table\" width=\"640\" height=\"261\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"261\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-17713900839895232_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-17713900839895232_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-17713900839895232_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-17713900839895232_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EXLS growth table <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a five-year basis, it does lag the sector by most metrics shown here. Still, a scan shows us ExlService delivered double-digit growth across all these metrics, so while it may have lagged, its growth has been substantial.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I’m not sure when the banner first appeared, it was likely on Monday, February 9, when the Quant system cut its rating from Hold to Sell.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The price slump began before the warning and Sell rating were issued, and the price has changed only modestly since they came out. And while Seeking Alpha has a wide reach, it is not read by all investors. As a result, we can assume the warning has had little to do with falling prices.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Institutional investors</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is possible the decline may have something to do with institutional investors. As the following Seeking Alpha table shows, the professionals own nearly 97% of outstanding shares:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-1771389247925353_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2202\" data-height=\"514\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-1771389247925353_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EXLS ownership table\" width=\"640\" height=\"149\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"149\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-1771389247925353_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-1771389247925353_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-1771389247925353_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-1771389247925353_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EXLS ownership table <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/exls/institutional-holdings%20\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nasdaq</a> reported two of the biggest institutional funds, BlackRock, Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc. trimmed their holdings in Q4-2025. BlackRock reduced its holding by 5.68% and Vanguard by 2.49%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Could they or other institutional investors have started cutting their holdings again in late January? It is possible, and somewhat likely, they did it in connection with the AI selloff. Or, since they move such large volumes, perhaps they started the AI slump.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That idea receives backing from the trading volumes. Over the past three months, the average volume has been about 1.5 million shares per day, but over the eight business days following February 2, six of those days had a volume of more than 3.5 million shares.

Why? A report from Anthony Lee of <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exl-transunion-shares-plummet-know-170545388.html%20\" rel=\"nofollow\">StockStory</a> points to bad news from Gartner, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IT\" title=\"Gartner, Inc.\">IT</a>) on February 3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lee wrote, “A number of stocks fell in the morning session after disappointing fourth-quarter results from industry bellwether Gartner sparked widespread concerns about a slowdown in the sector.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">He went on to say, “The research and advisory firm reported that revenue in its Consulting segment fell 12.8%. This weak performance from a major industry player appeared to validate broader market fears about the health of the IT services and consulting industry.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That story came out on the day ExlService fell 18.68%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At about the same time, ExlService and several of its peers/competitors dropped as well. This one-year chart of Data Processing &amp; Outsourced Services stocks compares ExlService with Genpact, Maximus, and Verra Mobility Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VRRM\" title=\"Verra Mobility Corporation\">VRRM</a>):</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-17713898552755873_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2342\" data-height=\"1060\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-17713898552755873_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EXLS comparative price chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"290\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"290\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-17713898552755873_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-17713898552755873_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-17713898552755873_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/17/24320523-17713898552755873_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EXLS comparative price chart <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Each of these stocks suffered price setbacks similar to that of MMS, although the inclusion of all four on one chart seems to dampen the dip for the other three. In particular, Verra, which appears unaffected on the chart, fell by more than a fifth, 21.50%, between January 9 and February 13.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on similarities between ExlService share prices and others in the AI sector, it seems likely the AI slump played a significant role in pulling down the price of not only ExlService but also those of its peers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Is it a buy or a sell?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, the fundamentals are strong, with the company delivering strong, steady growth over the past five years. In addition, the prospects for the next three years are strong, in the opinion of Wall Street analysts. They expect robust, double-digit earnings growth. And at those growth rates, ExlService should be known as an attractive compounder.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the slumping price, I expect it to recover, but do not know when (although it did reverse on February 26). What I do know is that there is a growing gap between the share price and earnings:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/24320523-17721370090210772_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2628\" data-height=\"922\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/24320523-17721370090210772_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EXLS price-earnings-chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"225\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"225\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/24320523-17721370090210772_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/24320523-17721370090210772_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/24320523-17721370090210772_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/24320523-17721370090210772_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EXLS price-earnings-chart <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gaps such as this create opportunities for investors, especially value investors, because the share price likely will follow earnings, eventually. This will mean strong capital gains for existing shareholders when (or perhaps if) it happens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a previous article, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4853696-exlservice-a-bond-substitute-for-bold-income-investors\">ExlService: A Bond Substitute For Bold Income Investors</a>, on December 16, 2025, I gave the company a Strong Buy based on its consistent growth, and the strength of its offerings in AI and data-driven services. I am maintaining that rating, and see no reason to change my one-year target price of $47.79.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risk factors</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the price has fallen significantly, it could drop even further. As we saw, it is expensive when compared with its peers, and it is quite possible buyers won’t outnumber sellers until there is P/E parity with Genpact and Maximus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Quant system may be correct, and I may be wrong about the significance of the warnings. If that is the case, expect the ExlService price to drop even more in coming weeks or even quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s share price can be shaken by news, as was the case with Gartner’s disappointing earnings results. In this case, I suspect investors overreacted to the news, but they always have the last word.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As an AI integrator, it faces many unknowns, both for its own operations and in what it does for its clients. Any failures could lead to reputational and financial harm.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The share price of ExlService Holdings has both wandered down and plunged for several weeks, apparently because of the AI slump and holding reductions by institutional investors. It further appears its fundamentals and investor expectations have not been factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AI slump and institutional selloffs are likely transitory, and prices should rebound at some point. The fundamentals are robust, and expectations are high based on future EPS estimates.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the widening gap between the fundamentals and share price suggests an opportunity to buy a quality stock at an undervalued price.</p>",

From a long-term perspective, it looks like the economy is growing at an unusually slow pace - barely a crawl. But considering the massive deportations of illegals and the virtual closure of our borders, it's not surprising.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some will argue that this shows an economy hovering on the brink of \"stall speed,\" but I think that's an analogy that doesn't really apply to an economy. Economies have a strong tendency to grow if they are not burdened by abrupt and unforeseen changes in monetary and fiscal policy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, it is comforting to see that new claims for unemployment show absolutely no sign of any fundamental deterioration in the outlook for business profits. Firings are low and stable. The worst that can be said about jobs is that there aren't many new jobs being created. But that could be improving.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #2</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_4780d8b4762cc72c85ba896959beb426.png?io=w640\" alt=\"monthly change in private sector jobs\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"282\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_4780d8b4762cc72c85ba896959beb426.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_4780d8b4762cc72c85ba896959beb426.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #2 shows the monthly change in private sector jobs, which appears to have picked up in the past month.

The past year has been dominated by an astonishing 11% decline in the federal workforce - the by-product of Trump's aggressive attack on the Deep State, in particular the Dept. of Education.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the chart also shows, the federal workforce today is as small as it has been since 1966! There are now 324K fewer regulators of the economy. A small government workforce equates to a significant reduction in regulatory burdens, which are typically a cost that most businesses would be happy to avoid.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This frees up resources for productive activity, and this is an unalloyed good thing. No one came close to predicting that the federal government workforce would ever decline by as much as it has in the past year. Note that the spikes in the data that occur every 10 years correspond to the temporary hiring of people needed to conduct the census.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #5</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a1e4a43ccc92e27a22c22fe158c46472.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"year-over-year change in the Consumer Price Index, compared to a version of the CPI that excludes shelter costs\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"231\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a1e4a43ccc92e27a22c22fe158c46472.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a1e4a43ccc92e27a22c22fe158c46472.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #5 shows the year-over-year change in the Consumer Price Index, compared to a version of the CPI that excludes shelter costs (which make up about ⅓ of the CPI). The gap between the two that shows up in the past several years is the direct result of an overestimation by the BLS of shelter costs. That problem is now behind us, and we are left with inflation that is only moderately above 2%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #6</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_52f35f65631177ec186bb328ef22eda3.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"shelter costs (Owner's Equivalent Rent)\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"239\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_52f35f65631177ec186bb328ef22eda3.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_52f35f65631177ec186bb328ef22eda3.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #6 focuses on shelter costs (which are called Owner's Equivalent Rent). This is what you would be paying if you had to rent the house you live in, and it is something that the BLS manufactures inside its computers, since nowhere does there exist such a thing in the real world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here we see that in the past month and past 3 months, the annualized change in this measure of shelter costs has fallen back - finally - to what it has tended to average in normal times. That explains why the gap between the two lines in Chart #5 has disappeared.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #7</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_affd6929d700bfade1b0ed3aa276f26b.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Housing prices\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"399\" height=\"219\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_affd6929d700bfade1b0ed3aa276f26b.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_affd6929d700bfade1b0ed3aa276f26b.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #7 has been featured regularly on this blog for the past several years. It is designed to show that the BLS's calculation of shelter costs (OER) is highly correlated to the year-over-year change in housing prices (blue line) from 18 months prior.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It took longer for OER to fall (given the prior decline in housing price inflation) than I thought, but the two lines are now back in sync at a level that is consistent with 2% overall inflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I note further that national home prices rose only 1.2% last year, and, adjusted for inflation, they are 2.2% <em>below</em> their mid-2022 peak. Housing prices are thus quite likely to exert downward pressure on inflation in the months to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #8</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a0005772f0bf6b59cf6d65c71352f1a4.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"M2 growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"230\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a0005772f0bf6b59cf6d65c71352f1a4.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_a0005772f0bf6b59cf6d65c71352f1a4.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #8 shows the year-over-year growth rate of the all-important M2 measure of the money supply. M2 rose on average by about 6% per year from 1995 through 2019, a period during which the CPI rose by 2% or less per year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More recently, M2 growth in the year ending January '26 was a mere 3.6%. In normal, pre-Covid times, most economists would predict that 3.6% M2 growth would lead to a slowdown in economic growth and a decline in inflation. Yet today the chatter is all about whether inflation is going to rise. This could be one of those times when the market is caught looking in the wrong direction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #9</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_791202bd0020d56980c2f5f0166c9972.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"2 divided by nominal GDP\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"233\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_791202bd0020d56980c2f5f0166c9972.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_791202bd0020d56980c2f5f0166c9972.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #9 shows what I consider to be a good measure of money demand: M2 divided by nominal GDP. This effectively measures how much of our annual income we like to hold in the form of readily spendable money (currency, checking accounts, retail money market funds, etc.).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Money demand today is pretty much the same as it was prior to COVID. The Covid years were characterized initially by a gigantic increase in the demand for money, which was then followed by a return or \"normal\" levels. My interpretation of all this is that monetary conditions are just about right: money supply is matched by money demand, and that equates to the absence of monetary imbalances that might fuel higher inflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #10</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_e9884dc1b5d240be38f572d3f0f473b0.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"the strength or weakness of the dollar\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"245\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_e9884dc1b5d240be38f572d3f0f473b0.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_e9884dc1b5d240be38f572d3f0f473b0.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #10 compares the strength or weakness of the dollar (a rising blue line equates to a weaker dollar, while a declining blue line equates to a stronger dollar) with the inflation-adjusted level of a basket of basic commodity prices. Note the very strong correlation of these two variables over time - except for the period following the Covid crisis, when supply chains were disrupted but the consumers wanted to ramp up their spending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Commodity prices back then were much stronger than the strength of the dollar would have predicted, and they helped fuel rising inflation. Recently, however, the two variables have come back into line with each other. Commodity prices are no longer \"too strong,\" while the dollar is still reasonably strong itself.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Commodity prices are not a source of inflation these days. Need I add that gasoline prices today are very close to their 20-year average ($2.88/gallon), and that they have fallen almost 40% from their 2022 high? Moreover, crude oil prices today are actually almost 10% <em>lower</em> than their 20-year average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #11</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_7a627f665cc25015b7392d30acb593fc.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"level of real GDP growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"242\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_7a627f665cc25015b7392d30acb593fc.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_7a627f665cc25015b7392d30acb593fc.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #11 shows the level of real GDP growth as it compares to two different trend lines (it's important to note the use of a log scale on the y-axis, which makes it easy to see growth trends). GDP rose by about 3.1% per year from 1966 through 2007, but since 2010 it has managed to grow by only a little more than 2.3% per year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth may be picking up of late, as noted in the comments above, but even if it does, the economy is still a lot less dynamic than it has been during most of our lifetimes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the \"disappointing\" growth of GDP since 2010 is due to several factors: 1) the <a href=\"https://climatechangedispatch.com/16-trillion-climate-spending-energy-poverty/\" rel=\"noopener\">$16 trillion</a> the world spent on futile attempts to prevent global warming, 2) a huge increase in US <a href=\"https://scottgrannis.blogspot.com/2014/07/whats-driving-decline-in-labor-force.html\" rel=\"noopener\">transfer payments</a>, and 3) a significant increase in regulatory burdens.

The difference between the two lines is, of course, the federal deficit, which is currently running at about $1.7 trillion per year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note also the huge surge in federal spending triggered by the Covid crisis - that consisted of approximately $6 trillion in transfer payments, which were effectively monetized by the Fed. It was all a nightmare, but it's fading rapidly. Note that spending has not reached new highs since 2022, and it has been flat for more than a year. The fiscal outlook is definitely improving.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart #13</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_6b29dc41e44983509450baa2a1ae1807.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"national debt\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"400\" height=\"250\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_6b29dc41e44983509450baa2a1ae1807.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_6b29dc41e44983509450baa2a1ae1807.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our national debt is just shy of 100% of GDP (<a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/debt-to-the-penny/debt-to-the-penny\" rel=\"noopener\">$31 trillion</a>), but we are not on the brink of a fiscal abyss. On the contrary, it is not unreasonable to think that Congress can manage some degree of spending control, and it is not the case that the economy faces a crushing burden of debt in any event, as Chart #13 shows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The true burden of debt is not the size of our national debt, but the cost of servicing that debt as a percent of our national income. Today that burden is significantly less than it was during the 1980s, mainly because interest rates are far lower than they were back then.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Congress exercises even modest restraint and the Fed doesn't have to raise interest rates (which they won't have to if inflation remains under control), then we can gradually reduce our deficits and the burden of our debt.

The company currently has seven approved and marketed products (five of which are out-licensed) and is advancing 11 late-stage clinical programs. Ionis was formed in 1989 and went public in 1991, with its first trade transacted at $10.75 a share. Its stock trades around $81.00 a share, translating to an approximate market cap of just north of $13 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Products</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Many of the company’s products and clinical programs are antisense therapies, which entail the creation of short, non-coded synthetic strands of DNA (antisense oligonucleotides) that are capable of binding to messenger RNA to influence gene expression.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/11.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1772031723\" alt=\"Wholly Owned Medicines\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/11.jpg?io=w1280&amp;ts=1772031723 1280w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/11.jpg?io=w1080&amp;ts=1772031723 1080w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/11.jpg?io=w750&amp;ts=1772031723 750w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/11.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1772031723 640w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/11.jpg?io=w480&amp;ts=1772031723 480w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/11.jpg?io=w320&amp;ts=1772031723 320w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/11.jpg?io=w240&amp;ts=1772031723 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>February 2026 Company Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Tryngolza</em>. Of its seven marketed products, the first one that the company is selling on its own in its 37-year history and most germane to the its future success is Tryngolza (olezarsen), a once monthly, self-administered, subcutaneously injected ligand-conjugated antisense (LICA) therapy as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglycerides in adults with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), a rare, genetic disease caused by impaired function of the lipoprotein lipase enzyme, prompting extremely elevated triglycerides (10 to 100 times normal). Designed to lower triglycerides by reducing the body’s production of protein APOC-3, Tryngolza is anticipated to also receive approval for severe hypertriglyceridemia (sHTG), a condition characterized by triglyceride levels above 500 mg/dL, which is associated with potentially fatal acute pancreatitis (AP – sudden inflammation of the pancreas). In two Phase 3 studies (CORE, CORE2), olezarsen demonstrated placebo-adjusted triglyceride level reductions of 55% and 72% at six months (both p&lt;0.001) and pooled data showed an 85% lowering of AP events after a year on therapy (p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, 54% of patients on high dose (80mg) olezarsen achieved normal triglyceride levels (&lt;150 mg/dL).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Those results should make Tryngolza the new standard of care for sHTG upon approval, likely forthcoming in 2H26. The market recognized these data when they were announced in early September 2025, rallying shares of IONS 35% to $57.49 in the subsequent trading session. Already off to an excellent start treating FCS (domestic population of ~3,000) with sales of $105 million during its first year on the market and patent protected until 2034, management now believes its triglyceride-lowering therapy should generate peak sales north of $2 billion, up from &gt;$1 billion prior to its results against sHTG, an indication with a population of approximately three million Americans. For sHTG, active agent olezarsen has received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/29/498952-17697113843139536_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Olezarsen\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"302\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/29/498952-17697113843139536_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/29/498952-17697113843139536_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/29/498952-17697113843139536_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/29/498952-17697113843139536_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>November 2025 Company Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It should be noted that <strong>Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARWR\" title=\"Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\">ARWR</a>)</strong> received approval for its RNA interference therapy Redemplo (plozasiran) treating FCS in November 2025 and is evaluating it in a pivotal trial (SHASTA-3) for the treatment of sHTG, which should readout in 3Q26. Also pursuing this indication in the clinic are 89bio’s FGF21 analog pegozafermin (Phase 3) and NorthSea Therapeutics’ oral CETP inhibitor NST-1024 (Phase 2).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Dawnzera</em>. Ionis’ other recently approved therapy is Dawnzera (donidalorsen), a once-monthly subcutaneous injection of prekallikrein-directed antisense oligonucleotide that was sanctioned by the FDA for prophylaxis to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema [HAE] in patients 12 years or older in August 2025 and on January 21, 2026 in the EU. HAE is a rare, chronic, and potentially life-threatening condition caused by deficiency or dysfunction of the C1 inhibitor protein. It is characterized by recurrent attacks of severe swelling, typically in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and airway, afflicting ~7,000 Americans. Approval was secured after Dawnzera reduced the HAE attack rate by 81% compared to placebo over 24 weeks. With three-quarters of patients currently treated with long-term prophylaxes and 90% interested in a new approach, management envisions peak annual sales potential for its HAE treatment at more than $500 million. Offering the potential for greater efficacy, tolerability, and convenience, Dawnzera enters a ~$5.9 billion global treatment market (Modor Intelligence – 2025) with five other approved therapies, including<strong> CSL Behring’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSLLY\" title=\"CSL Limited\">CSLLY</a>)</strong> recently approved anti-factor XIIa monoclonal antibody Andembry (garadacimab).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/29/498952-1769711061565909_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Dawnzera\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"345\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/29/498952-1769711061565909_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/29/498952-1769711061565909_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/29/498952-1769711061565909_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/29/498952-1769711061565909_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>November 2025 Company Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Out-Licensed Products</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to these two wholly owned commercial assets, Ionis has five other products that generate royalty or distribution revenue, the two most noteworthy of which are <strong>Biogen’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIIB\" title=\"Biogen Inc.\">BIIB</a>)</strong> spinal muscular dystrophy med Spinraza (nusinersen) and <strong>AstraZeneca’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZN\" title=\"AstraZeneca PLC\">AZN</a>)</strong> Wainua (eplontersen). Spinraza was approved in 2016 and has generated royalty revenue between $200 million and $250 million since FY22 after peaking at $293.0 million in FY19. Wainua was approved for polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTRv-PN) in 2023, generating royalty revenue of $33.1 million in the first nine months of 2025 (YTD25). More importantly, it is under Phase 3 evaluation (CARDIO-TTRansform) for ATTR-CM (cardiomyopathy), a patient population of 300K to 500K worldwide (versus 10K to 40K globally for ATTRv-PN), and an ~$8 billion domestic market. Data on 1,400+ patients from the pivotal trial are anticipated in 2H26. Between the two indications, Ionis's co-development deal with AstraZeneca makes it eligible to receive up to $3.3 billion in milestone payments in addition to mid-20% royalties.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Pipeline</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Zilganersen</em>. Competition won’t be an issue if Ionis receives approval for zilganersen, an RNA-targeted therapy designed to inhibit the production of glial fibrillary acidic protein for the treatment of Alexander disease (AxD). The progressive and ultimately fatal ultra-rare condition that affects the brain’s white matter is characterized by a loss of muscle control and death within 14 to 25 years post symptom onset. After achieving its primary endpoint of change in 10-meter walk time versus placebo (p=0.0412), Ionis anticipates filing an NDA in 1Q26. Zilganersen has received Orphan Drug designations from the FDA and EU, as well as Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in the U.S. Management places its peak sales potential at north of $100 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>ION582</em>. Another wholly owned neurological candidate of note is ION582, a once-every-12-week RNA-targeted therapy designed to inhibit UBE3A antisense transcript expression, thus increasing the production of UBE3A protein for the treatment of Angelman syndrome, a disease characterized by intellectual disability, balance issues, motor impairment, and seizures that present at infancy. Afflicting ~100,000 in major geographies, there are currently no approved disease-modifying therapies. After demonstrating a 97% response rate as defined by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-4 (Bayley-4) at 18 months in a Phase 1/2 trial (HALOS), ION582 is undergoing evaluation in a 158-patient Phase 3 study (REVEAL) with the primary endpoint change in performance of the expressive communication subdomain raw score of Bayley-4. If eventually approved for Angelman, management believes ION582 can achieve blockbuster status.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Out-Licensed and Share Pipeline</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to zilganersen, ION582, and five other wholly owned clinical programs, Ionis has 12 out-licensed assets that are undergoing clinical evaluation, not including the aforementioned Wainua. The most advanced candidates are <strong>GlaxoSmithKline’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GSK\" title=\"GSK plc\">GSK</a>)</strong> chronic hepatitis B med bepirovirsen, for which a 1Q26 filing is anticipated, and <strong>Novartis’ (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVS\" title=\"Novartis AG\">NVS</a>)</strong> elevated lipoprotein(a)-driven cardiovascular disease treatment pelacarsen, which could launch in 2027. Between these two candidates and Wainua in ATTR-CM, Ionis projects peak annual royalty revenue of more than $1.6 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>3Q25 Financials &amp; Revised Outlook</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Owing to the fact that it is still early days for wholly owned products Tryngolza and Dawnzera, the company is not near breaking even as it advances eight clinical programs, including its co-development deal for Wainua. That said, management believes it will achieve cash-flow breakeven in 2028. That outlook was provided as part of its 3Q25 financial report on October 29, 2025, when it posted a loss of $0.61 per share (non-GAAP) on revenue of $156.7 million versus a loss of $0.72 per share on revenue of $133.8 million in 3Q24.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The top line was $26.5 million better than expectations, prompting Ionis to raise its FY25 revenue outlook by $50 million to $887.5 million, based on range midpoints.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>4Q25 Financials:</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/22.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1772031723\" alt=\"FY2025 Performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/22.jpg?io=w1280&amp;ts=1772031723 1280w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/22.jpg?io=w1080&amp;ts=1772031723 1080w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/22.jpg?io=w750&amp;ts=1772031723 750w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/22.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1772031723 640w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/22.jpg?io=w480&amp;ts=1772031723 480w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/22.jpg?io=w320&amp;ts=1772031723 320w,https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/22.jpg?io=w240&amp;ts=1772031723 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>February 2026 Company Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ionis Pharmaceuticals posted its fourth-quarter <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556581-ionis-pharmaceuticals-gaap-eps-of-1_41-misses-by-0_09-revenue-of-203m-beats-by-46_87m\"><strong>results</strong></a> Wednesday.

On average, they <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IONS/earnings/estimates\"><strong>expect</strong></a> the company to achieve profitability in FY28, when it earns $1.90 on revenue of $1.88 billion. The bottom line should accelerate rapidly from there, with Ionis generating $8.79 per share on revenue of $4.04 billion in FY31.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Verdict:</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With two wholly owned products, five (essentially) out-licensed products, seven wholly owned clinical programs, 11 out-licensed clinical programs, and one co-development program, Ionis is an extremely active concern. Management estimates that from these 26 opportunities, it possesses annual peak revenue potential greater than $4 billion—thanks in large measure to the Tryngolza data in sHTG—annual peak royalty potential greater than $2 billion, and potential milestones totaling north of $6 billion. That said, shares of IONS are up over 80% since data from Tryngolza in September 2025 compelled management to raise its peak revenue estimate by $1 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static2.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/12.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1772031723\" alt=\"2026 Ionis Milestones\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static2.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/12.jpg?io=w1280&amp;ts=1772031723 1280w,https://static2.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/12.jpg?io=w1080&amp;ts=1772031723 1080w,https://static2.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/12.jpg?io=w750&amp;ts=1772031723 750w,https://static2.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/12.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1772031723 640w,https://static2.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/12.jpg?io=w480&amp;ts=1772031723 480w,https://static2.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/12.jpg?io=w320&amp;ts=1772031723 320w,https://static2.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/923/122923/slides/12.jpg?io=w240&amp;ts=1772031723 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>February 2026 Company Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, there are risks to the narrative—most notably, if once-monthly injectable Wainua cannot best oral offerings from <strong>Pfizer’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>)</strong> Vyndamax (tafamidis) or <strong>BridgeBio’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBIO\" title=\"BridgeBio Pharma, Inc.\">BBIO</a>)</strong> recently approved Attruby (Acoramidis) or Alnylam’s (ANLY) injectable RNA interference therapy Amvuttra (vutrisiran) in CARDIO-TTRansform. Furthermore, data from a Phase 3 study could compel partner AstraZeneca to prioritize its wholly owned IgG1-targeting monoclonal antibody ALXN2220 over Wainua for ATTR-CM. Lastly, <strong>Intellia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTLA\" title=\"Intellia Therapeutics, Inc.\">NTLA</a>)</strong> and <strong>Regeneron’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/REGN\" title=\"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\">REGN</a>)</strong> Phase 3 CRISPR therapeutic candidate NTLA-2001 could also alter the treatment landscape.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, even with the recent run and the potential risks to its story, its vast wholly owned and partnered pipeline of opportunities—as well as de-risked upside for Tryngolza—should allow shares of IONS to continue their grind higher over time. After its big rally, IONS doesn't merit a large position. However, when partnered with solid premiums in its options, Ionis is a decent <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>covered call</strong></a> candidate. That is my way of saying, I don't mind accumulating a stake in IONS. I just want to do so at a lower entry point after the shares recent rally.</p>",

The MSCI ACWI ex USA IMI Growth Index (the Proxy Benchmark) gained a more modest 2.44% for the quarter. For the full year 2025, the Fund gained 21.16%, while the Benchmark appreciated 32.39% and the Proxy Benchmark again gained a more modest 25.74%. While disappointed with our fourth quarter results, which in our view resulted largely from a healthy correction in several strong performing stocks heading into the quarter, we are content with our full-year results as measured by our outperformance against the Morningstar Foreign Large Growth Category average, in what proved a difficult relative performance year for quality growth investors. *</p> <p>In our view, the dominant theme of AI continued to captivate attention and drive returns during the fourth quarter, though we highlight that during the recent quarter the market was increasingly segmented into AI haves and have nots. We believe a broad universe of quality growth businesses traditionally viewed as competitively advantaged and protected by barriers to competition due to intellectual capital, proprietary data, and/or deep client entrenchment began to be viewed as vulnerable to AI disruption – triggering material multiple compression. Examples include software developers, data-centric and information service businesses, e-commerce operators, online advertising and travel-related businesses. While we believe companies that do not invest or move quickly enough to leverage AI to protect and enhance their strategic position will be at some risk, we also believe many competitively advantaged businesses will successfully maneuver to gain market share and improve customer experience while maintaining or expanding profitability. We believe the widespread weakness in these traditional quality growth stocks is excessive, and quite likely to mean revert, particularly if concerns grow regarding the availability of funding and/or power necessary to accommodate the historic increase in AI capital spending that is already discounted in market expectations. We are encouraged by the strong absolute and relative performance of international equities over the past year and continue to believe that we have entered a sustainable outperformance cycle which will also offer tailwinds for fundamental investment strategies such as the Fund. </p> <h4>Annualized performance (%) for period ended December 31, 2025</h4> <div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th></th> <th>Fund Retail Shares 1,2</th> <th>Fund Institutional Shares 1,2,3</th> <th>MSCI ACWI ex USA Index 1</th> <th>MSCI ACWI ex USA IMI Growth Index 1</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>QTD 4</td> <td>(3.02)</td> <td>(2.96)</td> <td>5.05</td> <td>2.44</td> </tr> <tr> <td>1 Year</td> <td>20.81</td> <td>21.16</td> <td>32.39</td> <td>25.74</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3 Years</td> <td>10.52</td> <td>10.81</td> <td>17.33</td> <td>14.55</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5 Years</td> <td>1.43</td> <td>1.68</td> <td>7.91</td> <td>4.03</td> </tr> <tr> <td>10 Years</td> <td>7.48</td> <td>7.74</td> <td>8.41</td> <td>7.86</td> </tr> <tr> <td>15 Years</td> <td>6.12</td> <td>6.39</td> <td>5.91</td> <td>5.96</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Since Inception (12/31/2008)</td> <td>9.08</td> <td>9.35</td> <td>8.03</td> <td>8.32</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>\n<span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button>\n</div> <div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td> <em>Performance listed in the above table is net of annual operating expenses.

Broadly, as referenced above, the underperformance was in our view attributable to an abrupt but material correction in several holdings over the potential exposure of quality growth franchises with historic competitive moats to AI disruption. From a sector or theme perspective, adverse stock selection effect in the Information Technology ('IT') sector, driven by a few positions across multiple themes (<a href=\"https://www.datalab.to/playground/documents/5471360a-91ce-4c1b-a6d6-40fe53634795/www.Wix.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wix.com </a>Ltd., Constellation Software Inc., Kaynes Technology India Limited, WiseTech Global Limited, Keyence Corporation), was the largest detractor to relative performance for the year. In addition, poor stock selection in the Consumer Discretionary sector, owing largely to meaningful drawdowns in eDreams ODIGEO SA and Trent Limited, also stood out as a detractor. Finally, weak stock selection effect in the Industrials sector, relating to select investments in our digitization (InPost S.A., Full Truck Alliance Co. Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YMM\" title=\"Full Truck Alliance Co. Ltd.\">YMM</a>)), fintech disruption (Experian plc), and Japan staffing (Recruit Holdings Co., Ltd., SMS Co., Ltd.) themes, also weighed on relative results. Partially offsetting the above, favorable allocation effect combined with good stock selection in the Materials (Lundin Mining Corporation, Lynas Rare Earths Limited, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AEM\" title=\"Agnico Eagle Mines Limited\">AEM</a>)) and Energy (Waga Energy SA) sectors was a positive contributor to relative performance during the year.</p> <p>From a country perspective for calendar year 2025, poor stock selection effect in Spain, Poland, and Israel, and a combination of weak stock selection and an overweight position in India, primarily attributable to the above-mentioned investments, drove the majority of relative underperformance. Partially offsetting the above was a combination of strong stock selection effect and/or favorable allocation in Australia, Ireland, Canada and France.</p> <p>Adverse stock selection effect across multiple themes within the IT, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, and Consumer Staples sectors was the key detractor to relative results, largely as described above. From a country perspective, poor stock selection effect in Spain, China, Korea, India, and Israel was the primary detractor to relative performance during the quarter. While we are disappointed by our fourth quarter performance, we remain confident about our investment process and portfolio holdings and further, as we believe the broad-based sell-off in quality growth franchises is overdue, we anticipate that some mean reversion and recovery of lost performance going forward is quite reasonable.</p> <h4>Top contributors to performance for the quarter</h4> <div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th></th> <th>Contribution to Return (%)</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Lundin Mining Corporation</td> <td>0.92</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>)</td> <td>0.48</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Bank of Ireland Group plc</td> <td>0.37</td> </tr> <tr> <td>argenx SE (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARGX\" title=\"argenx SE\">ARGX</a>)</td> <td>0.37</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tokyo Electron Limited</td> <td>0.35</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>\n<span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button>\n</div> <p>Lundin Mining Corporation is a base metals producer with a portfolio primarily focused on copper and gold. Shares rose meaningfully during the fourth quarter after the company raised its 2025 copper production outlook and lowered its cash cost guidance. A sharp rally in copper and gold prices also supported performance. We remain constructive on Lundin Mining due to its healthy growth profile, driven by its greenfield Josemaría and Filo del Sol copper projects in Argentina, as well as near-term production growth initiatives at existing mines. Lundin Mining has a solid acquisition track record and a history of expanding production and extending the operating lives of its acquired mines. The founding family retains meaningful oversight of the business, with the founder's grandson serving as President and CEO.</p> <p>Semiconductor giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited ('TSMC') contributed to performance during the quarter, driven by robust demand for AI chips. We retain conviction that TSMC's technological leadership, pricing power, and exposure to secular growth markets—including AI and high-performance computing, automotive, 5G, and Internet of Things—will allow the company to sustain strong double-digit earnings growth over the next several years.</p> <p>Bank of Ireland Group plc is one of the largest banks in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Shares rose during the quarter following strong quarterly results and an upward revision to net interest income guidance, which drove higher earnings expectations. Management highlighted solid loan and deposit momentum in Ireland, disciplined cost control, and continued organic capital generation, supporting earnings durability. Bank of Ireland's margins are more resilient than those of EU peers as interest rates ease, benefiting from a sizeable structural hedge that locks in higher yields from prior rate increases and cushions the impact of lower policy rates. Strong capital ratios and confidence around ongoing capital returns further reinforce our positive view.</p> <h4>Top detractors from performance for the quarter</h4> <div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th></th> <th>Contribution to Return (%)</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>eDreams ODIGEO SA</td> <td>(1.37)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Ajinomoto Co., Inc.</td> <td>(0.56)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>ODDITY Tech Ltd.</td> <td>(0.53)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Zai Lab Limited</td> <td>(0.44)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Kaynes Technology India Limited</td> <td>(0.42)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>\n<span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button>\n</div> <p>eDreams ODIGEO SA is a Spain-based online travel agency that offers a subscription-based travel savings program, Prime, covering flights and hotels. Shares declined during the quarter following the company's decision to pursue a significant growth investment plan, a pivot toward monthly and quarterly subscription offerings, and near-term inventory access issues with supplier Ryanair. In a departure from prior targets, eDreams now plans to invest more heavily in new markets and in European rail. While the company has previously tested various subscription durations, the broader shift toward shorter subscription terms is expected to pressure cash flow over the next several years. Longer term, we believe Prime's underlying value proposition remains compelling for customers, particularly as the product roadmap expands into hotels and incorporates generative AI-driven enhancements. As Prime matures, profitability has continued to improve, supported by lower marketing spend on customer acquisition. We continue to research and monitor the company's newer investment plans and progress across these initiatives.</p> <p>Japanese multinational food company Ajinomoto Co., Inc. detracted from performance due to weaker-than-expected growth in its Seasonings business. We believe this slowdown is temporary and that long-term growth will be supported by Ajinomoto's high-quality products and strong brand, along with increasing demand from Southeast Asia's emerging middle class. We are particularly optimistic about the prospects for Ajinomoto Build-up Film ('ABF'), an insulating material used in the packaging of high-performance semiconductors. Ajinomoto invented ABF in the late 1990s and has since maintained a near-monopoly position in this material, which plays a critical role in electrical isolation, signal routing, and heat dissipation. We expect high-margin ABF revenue to surge over the next five years, driven by robust demand for AI accelerators. As a result, we believe Ajinomoto has the potential to double earnings per share over this period, with ABF accounting for the majority of profit growth.</p> <p>ODDITY Tech Ltd. intends to transform the beauty and wellness market by using proprietary technology to sell and launch products exclusively online. Shares declined amid investor concerns around category strength following cautious commentary from industry peers, as well as credit card data indicating a potential deceleration at the company's largest brand, Il Makiage. ODDITY is also launching its third platform, MethodIQ, which required incremental upfront marketing investment during the year. Management expects MethodIQ to ramp quickly and deliver strong financial results in the coming years. Overall, the business remains well positioned to achieve its full-year target of approximately 20% revenue growth at a 20% margin. ODDITY has demonstrated an ability to create innovative products and successfully launch new brands by leveraging its molecule formulation and marketing capabilities.

We continue our endeavor to add to our highest conviction ideas.</p> <p>As part of our EU mutualization theme, we initiated a position in Euronext N.V., the leading pan-European market infrastructure operator, which runs the primary equity, fixed income, and derivatives exchanges across key European economies including France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Italy, while also operating clearing, settlement, data, and technology services. Euronext is unique in Europe for its vertically integrated model, combining multiple national markets on a single trading and technology platform while increasingly controlling more of the post-trade value chain. This gives it direct leverage to Europe's Savings and Investment Union ('SIU'), as policies aimed at channeling household savings into capital markets should drive higher retail participation, deeper equity and bond issuance, and greater cross-border activity, all of which benefits the company's business activities. The SIU also seeks to simplify and harmonize rules across European markets, which should reduce regulatory fragmentation, lower compliance complexity, and ultimately decrease operating costs for a pan-European operator like Euronext. Beyond these structural tailwinds, the company is pursuing several high-value opportunities, including bringing settlement and depository services in-house for its largest markets (currently outsourced), which would meaningfully expand recurring, high-margin post-trade revenues, and growing its MTS fixed-income franchise, particularly in French government bond trading, alongside related data and index products. Euronext's scale, regulatory alignment with EU priorities, capital-light economics, strong competitive advantages, and multiple internal growth levers make it an attractive investment within the European financials landscape.</p> <p>Adding to our advanced semiconductors/Al theme, we established a position in Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\">SSNLF</a>), the world's largest memory semiconductor manufacturer and a leading global technology conglomerate with diversified operations spanning memory chips, foundry services, and consumer electronics. Samsung holds the number one position in both DRAM and NAND flash memory markets, giving it unparalleled scale advantages in an industry characterized by high barriers to entry, stemming from technological complexity and intensive capital requirements. We believe the memory industry's unprecedented upcycle will continue at least over the next couple years, with a massive supply/demand mismatch driven by insatiable AI training and inference demand and disciplined capital allocation by the leading memory suppliers. Structurally, memory demand continues to benefit from the proliferation of data-intensive applications across cloud computing, mobile devices, and automotive electronics. Critically, we view Samsung as exceptionally well positioned to capitalize on the explosive growth in AI infrastructure spending, including through its high-bandwidth memory ('HBM') offerings. While Samsung has lagged SK hynix Inc. in HBM commercialization, we believe the company has achieved substantial progress in closing the performance gap. Given Samsung's superior manufacturing scale and extensive R&amp;D capabilities, we expect the company to gain meaningful share in the rapidly expanding HBM market over the coming years. Beyond memory, Samsung's foundry business represents an increasingly important growth vector, as the company positions itself as a credible alternative to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited for cutting-edge logic chip production, supported by significant investments in advanced process nodes and strategic customer partnerships. We anticipate Samsung will deliver robust earnings growth over the next several years, driven by a surging memory market, growing HBM revenue contribution, and improving foundry profitability, complemented by its leading global positions in smartphones and OLED display panels.</p> <p>During the quarter, we initiated a position in Brunello Cucinelli S.p.A., a best-in-class luxury apparel company with a solid position at the top of the luxury pyramid. Brunello designs and sells high-quality clothing and accessories, carefully managing its brand, distribution, and volumes to maintain exclusivity for a highly discerning global customer base of roughly 500,000 clients. This positioning in the ultra-luxury segment creates high barriers to entry, limited direct competition, strong pricing power, and demand that is structurally less cyclical than for broader luxury. Shares dropped abruptly during the quarter following a short report with allegations the company has since refuted, providing an attractive entry point into a company that has delivered consistent double-digit revenue growth across economic cycles. Looking ahead, we expect at least 10% annual revenue growth driven by disciplined retail expansion, particularly in China, selective product extensions, and modest price increases, all driving gradual margin expansion. Given its exceptional brand equity, scarcity value, and long runway for high-quality growth, we view Brunello Cucinelli as a compelling long-term investment.</p> <p>We increased exposure to our Japan interest rate normalization theme by initiating a position in Mitsui Fudosan Co., Ltd., Japan's largest diversified real estate developer. The company develops, owns, and manages high-quality office buildings, mixed-use urban districts, retail complexes, residential projects, hotels, and logistics assets. The company is also increasingly expanding overseas, particularly in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, where it partners with local operators to access higher-growth markets, diversify earnings, and deploy capital at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Mitsui Fudosan's competitive advantages include its scale, deep tenant relationships, and long track record of creating integrated, mixed-use districts that drive durable demand and long asset lives. This positions the company to benefit from the structural macro changes underway in Japan, particularly the transition from deflation to modest inflation alongside ever tightening vacancy rates, which supports rising rents and higher net operating income across its portfolio. In addition, Mitsui's strong balance sheet and stable cash flows provide flexibility to enhance shareholder returns over time through higher dividends and potential share buybacks. We view Mitsui Fudosan as an attractive long-term investment benefiting from structural rent growth, global diversification, and improving capital returns.</p> <p>Finally, we added to several of our existing positions during the quarter, most notably Japan Exchange Group, Inc., Nestle S.A. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NSRGY\" title=\"Nestlé S.A.\">NSRGY</a>), TotalEnergies SE (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TTE\" title=\"TotalEnergies SE\">TTE</a>), Reliance Industries Limited, Kuaishou Technology, and Keyence Corporation.</p> <p>In our endeavor to concentrate on our holdings where we have highest conviction in quality and return potential, during the quarter, we also exited a few positions, including Waga Energy SA, Godrej Consumer Products Limited, and DSM-Firmenich AG.</p> <h2>Outlook</h2> <p>During the final quarter of 2025, global equities extended prior year gains and delivered solid full-year returns. Notably, international and emerging market ('EM') equities significantly outperformed their U.S. and global counterparts for first time in several years. We believe the year 2025 likely represented the beginning of a sustainable period of international and EM equity outperformance. The year was marked by a largely unexpected U.S. withdrawal from the decades-long multilateral security and trade equilibrium, which triggered a variety of defensive policy responses around the world. When the U.S. subsequently negotiated new bilateral trade agreements, or relented, and materially diluted tariff and other protectionist measures, the monetary, fiscal and reform stimulus already in the pipeline led to solid global economic growth and, as the year progressed, various signs of excess liquidity and speculation. While geopolitics and financial markets exhibited volatility throughout the year, political, economic and financial constraints reigned in tail risks and, in our view, ultimately resulted in a much more constructive backdrop for international equities than was envisioned entering the year.</p> <p>While international equity returns were quite impressive for the year, fourth quarter returns were more modest, particularly for growth-related equities. China, a large and top-four weight in the Benchmark, consolidated year-to-date gains in a “sell the news” reaction after a significant summer rally in anticipation of the scheduled October meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi, as the immediate meeting readout did not reference the potential resumption of technology/semiconductor/WFE flow into China. As we stand in early 2026, signs of renewed technology flow have emerged in recent weeks, and Chinese equities tied to technology/ AI/robotics/semiconductors are recovering. We continue to believe that global investors are underestimating the capabilities and potential of China’s emerging technology/AI ecosystem, which appears particularly advantaged in terms of power supply and cost, open-source large language models, and overall capital requirements.</p> <p>On this point, during the quarter, U.S.-based hyperscaler capex commitments continued to rise, with an estimated $550 billion to be spent in 2026 on AI data center ('AIDC') development (up from earlier estimates closer to $450 billion). This arms race has captivated the attention of global investors while dominating equity market returns, though during the quarter we believe some yellow flags have surfaced. First, Google/Gemini’s momentum and market share gains vs. OpenAI/ChatGPT, while relying on lower cost TPUs, has raised questions around the sustainability of competitive advantage and NVIDIA’s longer-term market share and pricing power. Second, this uncertainty may challenge what has been a largely open-ended debt and equity funding environment for AIDC development, which calls into question whether current expectations for over $3.0 trillion in cumulative capex through 2030 will be met. While we do not have a particular view, we simply note that expectations are high, and that given the current S&amp;P 500 Index weighting and disproportionate share of global equity portfolios represented by this broader U.S. AI ecosystem, any downward estimate revision would likely result in further outperformance by non-U.S. equities.</p> <p>Just a few days into the new year, the U.S. conducted a military operation in Venezuela termed “Operation Resolve,” which involved extracting sitting President Nicolas Maduro and his wife and transporting them to the U.S., where they had been indicted on multiple charges. This operation evidences the Trump Administration’s foreign policy pivot away from global/multilateral peace, security, and trade towards an “America First” agenda, with an emphasis on bilateral negotiations, raw power, and the Monroe Doctrine, prioritizing the consolidation of U.S. interests within its “sphere of influence” in the Western Hemisphere. In our view, coupled with its previous and unconventional moves regarding Europe/NATO and apparent appeasement of Russia’s pursuit of territory from the Ukraine, we believe the weight of evidence likely points to less direct intervention in Russia and China’s respective spheres of influence, potentially diminishing the near to intermediate-term risk of geopolitical conflict. At the same time, we believe this action highlights rising global defense spending, as well as the value of strategic commodities/minerals and real assets, directly supporting our Global Security theme. Further, we are intrigued by the U.S. emphasis on the Monroe Doctrine and believe that any wholesale “rightward shift” by Latam countries could unlock material gains in the region’s bonds, equities, and currencies as risk premium would likely materially adjust.</p> <p>We see solid global economic and market performance as we enter the new year as an indication that financial conditions remain constructive. The U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed) confirmed a global central bank easing cycle during the third quarter of 2025, with additional rate cuts anticipated. Last year, authorities around the globe rolled out monetary, fiscal, and reform measures as emergency/insurance policies out of fear of the impact of aggressive U.S. trade policy. While in most cases the threat was later dialed down as a byproduct of both bilateral trade negotiations and political and economic constraints, the insurance policy support remained in the pipeline. This led to better-than-expected global economic and earnings momentum, and by late in the year, various signs of robust liquidity if not exuberance. In the U.S., the Trump Administration has shifted emphasis towards this year’s mid-term elections, also sparking incremental fiscal and policy easing as well as ongoing “national service” by large corporates. We believe 2026 could likely represent a major test of Fed independence, as we are getting late in a global economic expansion cycle, implying less slack in the system, with the forward-looking path for inflation expectations in our view more likely higher than lower. Normally, this would trigger a more hawkish Fed, though should this scenario present in the year ahead, a yet to be determined new Fed Chairman may have difficulty in delivering on expectations given the Trump Administration's clear bias for lower rates. Should inflation tick up and longer-term bond yields rise/steepen, any waiver by the Fed would near certainly set off a new round of dollar weakness, and if history is any guide, extend or amplify international equity outperformance.</p> <p>We look forward to our next update and thank you for investing in the <em>Baron International Growth Fund </em>®.</p> <p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p> <p><strong>Michael Kass</strong><strong>Portfolio Manager</strong></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <hr> <p> </p> <h4>References</h4> <ol> <li>The MSCI ACWI ex USA Index Net ('USD') measures equity market performance of large and mid cap securities across 22 Developed Markets and 24 Emerging Markets countries.

The most striking takeaway from these meetings was regional resilience. The macro stress of the past has eased faster than expected, and what is emerging in its place is a more normalized but also differentiated investment landscape, one where politics, demographics, and selection matter more than headline inflation alone. Against this backdrop, we see the most compelling opportunities in companies aligned with long-term structural themes, including defense spending and investment-led growth.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">From Stress to Normalization</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) has moved past the acute macro stress of the last two years. Inflation shocks, aggressive tightening, and crisis-driven uncertainty have eased faster than expected in several markets. Disinflation in energy and food prices, combined with early signs of labor market cooling, has reduced pressure on households and policymakers alike. Central banks across the region remain cautious but the direction of travel has shifted from restrictive toward more accommodative, creating room for gradual easing through 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CEE economies such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Romania are growing steadily supported by an exceptionally strong labor market. Labor shortages remain a structural feature across Europe, estimated at roughly 15–17% in many countries.<sup>1</sup> This scarcity anchors wage growth, limits the risk of sharp cyclical downturns, and supports continued growth in domestic consumption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While disinflation has stabilized household balance sheets, a broad-based recovery in consumer demand has not yet fully materialized. Savings rates remain elevated, housing activity subdued, and discretionary spending cautious.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Importantly, this caution appears cyclical rather than structural. As real incomes continue to recover and monetary policy shifts gradually toward easing, we believe the region is approaching an inflection point. The next leg of growth will be increasingly consumption-led, as improving economic conditions restore confidence and unlock pent-up demand.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Politics Sets the Ceiling</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While macro stabilization has reduced downside risks across the region, political dynamics are increasingly shaping investment outcomes and relative performance across equity markets. In Poland, institutional friction between the presidency and parliament has slowed policy execution. In Hungary, the April 2026 parliamentary election dominates the short-term outlook as uncertainty over EU relations reinforces a wait-and-see posture among investors and corporates. In Turkey, despite a credible disinflation path, recurring political noise has underscored how fragile confidence remains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Across the region, the message was consistent: stabilization helps, but politics sets the ceiling for valuation. Fiscal deficits remain elevated across parts of the region, but markets are increasingly discerning, rewarding countries where deficits fund productive investment while penalizing weaker fiscal discipline.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Defense Spending as a Structural Anchor</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Defense spending has become the clearest expression of policy pragmatism across the region given current geopolitical tensions and elevated security risks from the Russia-Ukraine war. After decades of underinvestment, European and NATO defense markets are now undergoing a structural reset — with ammunition and land systems among the most capacity-constrained and strategically critical segments.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Defense Spending as a Share of GDP in Selected Countries</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/27f4ffc2e0624943bd5036f0f0919fdb/6886_navigating-emerging-europe_chart-1_2026-02_v1_desktop.svg\" alt=\"Defense Spending as a Share of GDP in Selected Countries\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: NATO, as of June 3, 2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NATO commitments and EU-level financing make defense spending sustainable and long-dated. Importantly, this investment extends well beyond military procurement. It is supporting domestic manufacturing, logistics capabilities, rail, ports, and broader infrastructure, creating a spillover effect across multiple industries. Unlike cyclical stimulus, defense investment offers multi-year visibility and reinforces domestic industrial capacity, making it one of the most durable capital-allocation themes in the region.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Poland: The Star of CEE</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among all countries visited, Poland stood out as the region’s structural outperformer. The country continues to benefit from substantial EU funding, elevated defense spending, and a robust infrastructure pipeline. 2026 is shaping up to be a pivotal year, with Recovery and Resilience Facility inflows expected to more than triple versus 2025, alongside rising absorption of cohesion funds and low-interest loans for defense investments from the EU.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Poland EU Fund Inflows</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/4854c33db6d14c96a99d2b87e02a3815/6886_navigating-emerging-europe_chart-2_2026-02_v1_desktop.svg\" alt=\"Poland EU Fund Inflows\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Schuman Associates, as of December 2024.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Poland is also benefiting from a strong labor market that has improved wage growth and household income. Given the tight labor market and monetary easing, we believe household consumption is poised to reaccelerate as easing policy and sustained wage growth restore confidence.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Central Asia: A Different Growth Engine</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An unexpected, but increasingly important, theme that emerged during meetings on the ground was growth in Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. These economies are sustaining 5–7% real GDP growth, driven by young demographics, urbanization, rising productivity, and increasing domestic investment. Financial penetration remains low, creating long runways for credit growth. <em>Kaspi<sup>*</sup></em>, Kazakhstan’s leading super app, continues to drive the formalization of payments, e-commerce penetration, and financial inclusion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Uzbekistan is at an earlier stage in its economic development but that is precisely what makes it compelling. The country has been moving away from a closed economy towards a more open one, introducing new regulations to develop its capital market and attract investment. Rising investor interest reflects the government’s privatization drive and its objective of lifting GDP from $150 billion today to above $200 billion by 2030. Foreign companies are seeking to actively expand in the country, drawn to its high growth profile and regional champions are already positioning for this next phase of growth. Large banks such as <em>OTP Bank<sup>*</sup></em> are expanding in Uzbekistan, seeking to capture structurally higher credit growth than is available in slower-growing European markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, Central Asia provides a complementary growth engine to Emerging Europe: less constrained by demographics, earlier in its financial development, and offering the kind of structural growth that defined emerging markets in earlier decades. For investors willing to look beyond traditional regional buckets, the opportunity set is both familiar and increasingly investable.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Selective Exposure Across Emerging Europe and Central Asia</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Across the region, our <strong><a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/emerging-markets-fund-gbfax\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener\" title=\"GBFAX - Emerging Markets Fund - Class A - Overview\">VanEck Emerging Markets Fund</a></strong> remains selective. <em>OTP Bank<sup>*</sup></em>, Hungary’s largest commercial bank is likely to benefit from a pickup in corporate lending in 2026. We believe the bank could deliver strong lending growth with decent net interest margins across all its addressable markets. The bank also has ambitions to strengthen its presence in Uzbekistan after acquiring a majority stake in one of the country’s top lenders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>PKO Bank Polska<sup>*</sup></em> is likely to benefit from accelerating loan growth as EU-funded projects transition to bank-financed investment. Similarly, <em>InPost<sup>*</sup></em> with its comprehensive business logistics and consumer focused services is poised to benefit from industrial and discretionary consumption trends in Poland and broader EU region. In contrast to the companies benefitting from macro trends, <em>Diagnostyka<sup>*</sup></em> provides healthcare exposure to Poland’s underpenetrated medical diagnostics industry that is benefiting from industry consolidation and rising demand for diagnostic services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We believe <em>MLP Sağlık<sup>*</sup></em>, the largest hospital group in Turkey could deliver strong earnings growth. The company is well positioned to benefit from consolidation in the industry and enjoys significant pricing power that boosts its profit margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of Georgia’s largest banks,<em> Bank of Georgia<sup>*</sup></em> with over 40% market share offers scale and operating leverage. We believe the company will continue to grow its Armenian operations, benefitting from Armenia’s lower banking penetration and rapid loan growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also believe Greek banks, <em>Piraeus Bank<sup>*</sup> and Eurobank<sup>*</sup></em> will benefit from strong loan growth in 2026 and beyond supported by private consumption and a multi-year investment cycle tied to EU fund inflows. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positioning for Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our meetings reinforced the view that with the macro reset largely behind us, the Emerging Europe opportunity now lies more in active selection. Investment-led themes including defense, EU-funded infrastructure, financial deepening, and consumption recovery offer the clearest visibility. Politics and institutions will continue to drive dispersion, but for investors willing to be selective, the opportunity set is compelling. In Emerging Europe, durability and execution matter more than narrative, and that is where we see the strongest potential for returns. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Disclosures</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><sup>1</sup> Source: Reuters</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><sup>*</sup>Portfolio weights as of 1/31/2026, PKO Bank Polska: 0.52%, InPost SA 0.98%, Diagnostyka 0.54%, Kaspi 1.29%, OTP Bank 1.43%; MLP Saglik 1.62%, Bank of Georgia 1.81%, Piraeus Bank 1.28%, EuroBank 1.12%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All indices listed are unmanaged indices and include the reinvestment of all dividends, but do not reflect the payment of transaction costs, advisory fees or expenses that are associated with an investment in the Fund.

A series of geopolitical flare-ups across multiple regions has<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> strained alliances, raised military tensions, and reintroduced trade and policy uncertainty. The recent expansion of the U.S. military presence in the Middle East has intensified concerns about the potential for a direct confrontation with Iran, should ongoing negotiations fail. Any escalation, particularly one affecting oil supply routes or leading to a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, would carry meaningful implications for both energy and global financial markets.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet despite the rise in geopolitical volatility, markets have not experienced a major pullback. This resilience echoes the market’s behavior during 2025’s disruptive trade environment, highlighting investors’ ability to remain focused on solid economic fundamentals rather than on headline noise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, the rapidly shifting geopolitical environment adds another layer of complexity for investors. With uncertainty proving persistent, maintaining discipline and a long-term perspective remains essential in navigating the evolving global landscape.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How equity markets react to geopolitical events</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the unpredictable nature of geopolitical events, forecasting their short- or long-term outcomes is inherently difficult. While fear of uncertainty can drive investor behavior, history shows that equity market reactions in response to geopolitical shocks are generally brief. The exception occurs when such events materially affect economic fundamentals, central bank actions, or coincide with periods of broader macro weakness.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One example is the 1973 oil embargo, which forced the Federal Reserve (Fed)—already grappling with persistent inflation since the mid-1960s and fiscal strain following the Vietnam War—to sharply raise rates to counter oil-driven price pressures. This drove bond yields higher, slowed the U.S. economy, and weighed heavily on equities until the fall of 1974. Equities did not find a bottom until a steep rate-cutting cycle in 1974-75 revived economic activity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More recently, the Russia-Ukraine conflict in February of 2022 compounded an already challenging macro backdrop. Post-COVID supply shocks had driven inflation higher globally, and Russia’s invasion triggered a surge in energy prices, adding further inflationary pressures. Ultimately, major global central banks, including the Fed, tightened policy, and economic conditions slowed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By contrast, Russia’s annexation of Crimea nearly a decade earlier had a limited market impact. Energy prices did not surge, allowing financial conditions to remain stable. There was no central bank intervention; the Fed remained in an extended period of zero interest rate policy, and the European Central Bank kept its accommodative stance. This backdrop of easy monetary conditions helped support economic activity, enabling the stock market to reach all-time highs despite geopolitical uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, markets typically stay anchored to fundamentals, which generally outweigh short-term uncertainty unless geopolitics disrupts them.</p> <p

Source: Bloomberg, Principal Asset Management. Data as of February 23, 2025.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The global AI race and its role in geopolitics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The global AI arms race is one channel through which geopolitics could influence economic and corporate fundamentals. The tech rivalry between the U.S. and China—and other major AI players—is likely to spark geopolitical flare-ups in the near future, as the importance of achieving AI dominance aligns with securing economic strength, military power, and global influence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this quest for dominance, reliable access to the resource-intensive AI supply chain (e.g., minerals, energy, semiconductors, infrastructure, talent, capital) is imperative. No country controls the entire AI supply chain. Instead, the supply chain functions as a global network, with various regions specializing in different key AI inputs. This interdependence leaves AI advancement in any given country largely reliant on cross-border collaboration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Against this backdrop, disrupting or constraining the export of a critical input to slow a region’s AI advancement has become a powerful geopolitical weapon, evident in recent policy actions from the U.S. and China.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The U.S. strategy to constrain China’s AI capabilities</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the U.S. has maintained its position as the leading global power, China has rapidly advanced its tech capabilities and demonstrated an ability to innovate, not just to replicate. Notably, China’s ability to deliver high-quality goods at lower cost across various industries, including tech, has prompted the U.S. to respond with policies aimed at slowing China’s AI advancement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Commanding about 50% of the global semiconductor market, the U.S. has leveraged this strength against China, whose reliance on Western rivals for advanced hardware remains a key vulnerability. Since the Biden administration, the U.S. has imposed—and continually revised—export restrictions on advanced semiconductors, a policy that evolves as geopolitical conditions shift and the “America first” drive to maintain tech dominance intensifies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond its own restrictions, U.S. policymakers have pressured allies to block China’s potential efforts to bypass U.S. export controls. For several years, the U.S. has pressured the Dutch government to bar ASML (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASML\" title=\"ASML Holding N.V.\">ASML</a>)—which dominates the global market for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, critical for manufacturing the highest-performing chips that power modern technologies—from exporting advanced chipmaking tools to China. Ultimately, efforts to constrain China’s ability to produce advanced semiconductors ensure its ongoing reliance on Western technology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Global semiconductor market share</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>By company headquarters location</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733705795019_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1353\" data-height=\"535\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733705795019_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Global semiconductor market share\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"253\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733705795019_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733705795019_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733705795019_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733705795019_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">China’s geopolitical levers</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While U.S. policy measures have perhaps slowed China’s AI progress, they have not prevented Beijing from continuing to advance. This was evident in last year’s release of China’s DeepSeek AI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DEEPSEEK\" title=\"Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd.\">DEEPSEEK</a>) model, widely viewed as China’s “Sputnik” moment, which triggered a temporary sell-off in U.S. tech-sector darlings after Beijing demonstrated it could deliver a high-performance AI model at a lower cost.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China, after all, has been able to work around U.S. advanced semiconductor constraints by clustering large numbers of lower-grade chips and absorbing the higher energy costs required to run them. Simultaneously, Beijing has used its own geopolitical levers to ease U.S. export restrictions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China also maintains a dominant position in another critical tech input, rare earth elements, which are used heavily across industries, notably tech and defense, for their magnetic and luminescent properties once refined. While China commands almost 70% of the global market share in rare earth mining, its dominance is greater in rare earth refining and magnet production—over 90% and 98% of global market share, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over decades, China has built unmatched expertise and scale in rare earth refining—a complex, labor-intensive, and expensive process—while the rest of the world, including the U.S., has become increasingly reliant on it. This U.S. vulnerability became evident when China retaliated against U.S. tariffs last year, prompting renewed negotiations given both countries’ interdependence in the AI supply chain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notably, China recently imposed rare earth export restrictions on Japan in response to Japan’s stance on Taiwan, a sign that China will likely continue to use this policy lever as long as the U.S. and other countries remain dependent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>China vs. U.S. market share of rare earth production</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>Magnets and other rare earth elements</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733887814076_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1358\" data-height=\"589\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733887814076_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"China vs. U.S. market share of rare earth production\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"278\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733887814076_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733887814076_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733887814076_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733887814076_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, recent geopolitical events may have a common theme around the race to AI dominance and restricting rivals’ access to critical resources.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>U.S. actions in Venezuela/Iran</strong>: Recent U.S. military intervention in Venezuela and heightened tensions in Iran have sparked debates about whether the U.S. seeks to restrict China’s oil access, thereby gaining another geopolitical lever against Beijing.</li> <li> <strong>U.S. actions in Greenland</strong>: Beyond its strategic location for monitoring missile activity, there is a debate around Greenland’s mineral wealth and its potential role in global tech supply chains, also emphasizing American efforts to access natural resources while limiting China.</li> <li> <strong>China military drills around Taiwan</strong>: China recently conducted military drills around Taiwan’s major ports, simulating a potential blockade that would isolate the island. The U.S.’s ongoing reliance on Taiwan, which manufactures roughly 90% of the world’s most powerful semiconductors, leaves U.S. tech vulnerable to potential supply chain disruptions, especially a Chinese-initiated halt to semiconductor exports.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As long as the U.S. and China remain reliant on one another for key AI inputs, tail risks are somewhat contained. However, reducing this mutual dependence (an effort underway on both sides) could increase tail risks, though the outcome or timing of such an event is essentially impossible to pinpoint.<sup> <a href=\"https://www.principalam.com/us/insights/macro-views/geopolitics-age-ai#footnote1_n5utc6k\" title=\"View footnote 1\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a> </sup>For now, markets may simply contend with ongoing headline risk, which they have grown accustomed to since Liberation Day.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Economic and investment implications</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far this year, the geopolitical landscape has had a limited market impact, as no single event has triggered a crisis in AI and its supply chain. However, as investors navigate an increasingly uncertain environment, slow-building policy actions aimed at advancing national ambitions and curbing rivals’ influence within the AI space should not be overlooked.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The concentration of the U.S. equity market within a few large tech companies—firms that would be substantially affected by restrictions on critical resources and supply chain disruptions—highlights the importance of geopolitical risk to the overall market. A negative event impacting the tech sector or individual firms could reverberate through the broader U.S. and global economies. This is particularly concerning given that tech capital expenditures have become crucial to economic growth, and households, especially those with higher incomes, have significant exposure to tech-concentrated equity markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In essence, the chokepoints within the tech sector and its expanding influence on both portfolios and the economy suggest that if U.S./China tech capabilities are undermined by policy actions, geopolitics could transition from a background concern to a catalyst for substantial economic consequences.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The unpredictability of such events underscores the importance of broader diversification as a strategy to mitigate potential shocks and help contain downside tail risk. To reduce reliance on U.S. tech, investors might explore opportunities across various regions, particularly Europe, emerging markets, and the broader U.S. equity market, such as the S&amp;P 493, all of which offer supportive domestic tailwinds beyond just AI. Additionally, commodities, especially precious metals, may gain a more prominent role in portfolios if resource hoarding leads to inflationary pressures or geopolitical behaviors spark bouts of market volatility. Furthermore, industries poised to benefit from heightened geopolitical tensions, such as defense and aerospace, offer additional opportunities for investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By adopting a diverse investment strategy, one can better navigate the intricate and evolving landscape of global markets.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Footnotes</h4> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li><p>The U.S. proposed Pax Silica, a strategic partnership among key countries—excluding China— designed to secure access to key inputs in the AI supply chains. U.S. government entities have also acquired stakes in U.S.-based rare earth refiners to accelerate independence, thereby reducing China dependence. China has expanded trade relationships across Asia and more recently with Canada, a long-time U.S. trading partner who has received over $70 million in funding through the U.S. Defense Production Act to support Canada’s critical mineral development. Additionally, reports claim that Beijing successfully reverse-engineered an ASML-style EUV machine, marking an important milestone toward semiconductor autonomy.</p></li></ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.principalam.com/us/insights/macro-views/geopolitics-age-ai\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",
