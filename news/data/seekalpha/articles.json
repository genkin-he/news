Since my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4842946-vpu-ai-infrastructure-drive-capital-deployment-and-new-ppas\">previous coverage</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> last November, the fund delivered a 5.8% total return, and I believe that VPU has the potential of up to 10% further gains. My previous article highlighted that the inconsistency between the artificial intelligence expansion and the ramp-up timing of the power generation capacity is sharpening up as the major hyperscalers are already experiencing power undersupply. The inconsistency is more than clear, and the government will now require data center operators to pay for their electricity needs. This could strengthen the investment commitments and collaborations between technology and utility players, boosting the development of the national power grid with accompanying generation capacity. Hence, I would like to reaffirm my bullish stance on the VPU ETF, as the favorable power demand profile could strengthen the sector's earnings growth and dividend yield.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vanguard Utilities ETF is established to provide an <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vpu#overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">exposure</a> to the American utility sector, including stocks of companies engaged in the distribution of electricity, water, or gas, or that operate as independent power producers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-1772110072480632_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"945\" data-height=\"384\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-1772110072480632_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Fund industry allocation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"260\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-1772110072480632_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-1772110072480632_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-1772110072480632_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-1772110072480632_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Fund industry allocation <span>(Vanguard)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund’s sector allocation didn’t change since my previous coverage, betting mainly on electric utilities (61.7% share) and multi-utilities (24.3% share).

On the one hand, the utility sector is benefiting from the rapid development of the AI infrastructure, which drives a significant increase in electricity demand. On the other hand, the main technology players are feeling the pressure from the AI frenzy, as investors are increasingly concerned over the unprecedented surge in AI CapEx and the potential returns on data center investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s becoming clear that the current power generation capacity is not keeping up with the AI infrastructure expansion. Meanwhile, the industry is going through favorable regulatory developments, where the newly negotiated rate protection <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556455-trump-orders-tech-giants-to-power-their-own-ai-data-centers-under-rate-protection-pledge\">pledge</a> would require major technology companies developing artificial intelligence data centers to cover their own electricity needs.

For reference, the largest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, has <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/pjm-approves-118bn-transmission-expansion-plan-amid-data-center-boom/\" rel=\"nofollow\">approved</a> an $11.8 billion transmission expansion plan to keep up with surging data center connection requests across its footprint. This is especially relevant as the combined capital expenditures of the main hyperscalers are <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4873548-nvidia-doesnt-need-to-pay-for-its-chips-due-to-pricing-power\">expected</a> to top $650 billion in 2026, dedicated mainly to data center infrastructure. For comparison, the U.S. energy utilities are projected to invest $222 billion in 2026. This represents only a fraction of that going to the data centers, underlining the fact that there is substantial room for expansion in the utility companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, this represents a positive scenario for the utility sector, as the rising energy consumption for AI infrastructure stimulates capital investment expansion by the utility operators. The growth of investments could boost the utilities' rate base, which creates conditions for higher revenue requirements, earnings growth, and dividend distributions.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Future Potential</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the calculations of the VPU future upside potential, I will use the same weighted average target prices approach. According to the analyst estimates, VPU ETF has a 6.3% capital gain potential over the next 12-month horizon. Taking into account the forward DPS estimates, the total return of VPU ETF could be estimated at 9%, which makes me reaffirm my Buy recommendation on the fund.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-17721103151747112.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Valuation Model Based on Consensus Estimates\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"539\" height=\"725\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-17721103151747112.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-17721103151747112.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51784773-17721103151747112.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Valuation Model Based on Consensus Estimates <span>(Seeking Alpha; Author's Estimates)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taking a closer look, we can notice that the largest part of the estimated upside potential should come from Vistra Energy, Constellation Energy, PG&amp;E Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PCG\" title=\"PG&amp;E Corporation\">PCG</a>), Duke Energy, and NRG Energy, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NRG\" title=\"NRG Energy, Inc.\">NRG</a>). In particular, Vistra could benefit from its 2.6GW natural gas asset acquisition, the 20-year PPA at Comanche Peak NPP, and plans to develop two gas-fired units in West Texas. Constellation stands among the main beneficiaries of the data center electricity demand surge, since the company operates the largest fleet of nuclear power facilities with a total nameplate capacity of close to 28GW. PG&amp;E has a strong 5-year capital plan of $73 billion through 2030, which stipulates an average annual rate base growth of 9% and EPS growth of at least 9%. In addition, the California utility adds 2GW of projects in final engineering from last quarter, up to almost 3.6GW. Going forward, Duke Energy operates the second largest nuclear portfolio in the U.S. with 10GW in total capacity and has the largest fully regulated capital plan in the industry of $103 billion spanning over 5 years, which has the potential to drive up to a 7% long-term EPS growth rate. NRG Energy, in turn, targets a strong 14% annual growth in adjusted EPS and FCF through 2030, effectively doubling its generation capacity to 25GW following the closure of the LS Power transaction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the earnings estimates, the utility sector could register 8.4% earnings growth in the first quarter of 2026, compared to 2.7% blended growth so far in Q4. Moreover, the EPS growth is expected to accelerate during the year, which indicates strong dividend flow potential. In addition, the target interest rate is anticipated to drop by 50 bps over the next 12-month horizon. This could alleviate the industry’s debt burden, strengthen earnings, and make the utilities dividend profile more appealing compared to the 10-year government bond yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, I will reaffirm my bullish call on the VPU ETF, which has the potential for up to a 10% return over the next one-year period. I believe that the utility sector is one of the most prominent investment opportunities in 2026, powered by solid fundamentals behind energy demand growth from AI infrastructure and favorable regulatory support.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk Factors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Natural disasters remain a critical risk factor for utility sector infrastructure. For instance, Edison International (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EIX\" title=\"Edison International\">EIX</a>) shares fell sharply in the beginning of last year amid massive wildfires in California, with ongoing investigations into whether faulty equipment at the company was involved in the fires. Meanwhile, with capital expenditures rising, the role of government regulation is increasing, as the ability to pass on additional costs to consumers depends on the regulator's position.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The rapid development of AI infrastructure is the main driving factor for the growth in the utility sector. The existing gap between data center electricity needs, which are growing exponentially, and the current capacity of the U.S. power grid is forcing utility operators to accelerate capital projects. An increased rate base strengthens utilities’ financial performance, which positively impacts earnings and dividend yield, increasing the investment attractiveness of the industry. Against this backdrop, I believe that VPU ETF is a reasonable investment with the potential to deliver up to a 10% return over a 1-year horizon.</p>",

Given the company's healthy balance sheet and low non-accruals with healthy internal risk ratings, the core debate here is not whether OBDC can survive or not, but rather why the market is penalizing it to such a great degree. Yes, a dividend cut is likely, as we will discuss in this article, especially given that the Federal Reserve is expected to continue cutting rates this year and spreads stay quite tight in the industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, the market has overreacted, and while I would not pay a one-times or greater NAV ratio on OBDC shares given the hefty fees that management charges and the headwinds that the industry faces, I think that the current discount to NAV looks far too wide, and therefore rate it a strong buy today.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Inside the Portfolio: Senior Secured Strength and Diversification</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the most important aspects of the <span class=\"highlighted_text\">OBDC <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829842-12-percent-yielding-strong-buys-golub-capital-bdc-edges-out-blue-owl-capital\">thesis</a></span> is the state of its investment portfolio, as there have been a lot of fears raised in the media recently about the state of private credit, with UBS (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UBS\" title=\"UBS Group AG\">UBS</a>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556438-ubs-hikes-worst-case-private-credit-default-view-to-15-on-ai-fears\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556438-ubs-hikes-worst-case-private-credit-default-view-to-15-on-ai-fears\" target=\"_blank\">forecasting up to 15% default rates</a> in the near future. The market seems to be pricing this into OBDC right now, given its over 20% discount to NAV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the fundamentals are actually quite strong, with the company having a 79% senior secured portfolio, with 73.1% of its debt invested in first-lien loans. Additionally, the portfolio is very well diversified with 234 companies across 30 industries, with its top 10 positions representing just 23% of its portfolio on a fair value basis.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721331961583111_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"933\" data-height=\"572\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721331961583111_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Investor Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"392\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"392\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721331961583111_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721331961583111_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721331961583111_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721331961583111_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company also has significant joint venture and specialty finance investments that amount to about 12% of the portfolio, which are less exposed to falling base rates and have generated higher returns on equity over time, with over 14% ROEs based on management's commentary on the latest earnings call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taking a deeper look at the health of the portfolio, they have strong headline numbers with only 1.1% non-accruals at fair value and 2.3% at cost, which are competitive with many other BDCs out there. There's certainly been no indication of distress. Additionally, their internal risk ratings are pretty healthy, with 90.7% of the portfolio falling into an internal risk rating of 1 or 2 and only 1.4% of the portfolio falling at the riskiest level of either 4 or 5, which importantly is unchanged quarter over quarter and shows that they are unlikely to see a significant spike in non-accruals in the near term and are also at low risk of significant long-term capital losses based on the current state of their portfolio.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Buybacks, Balance Sheet Strength, and a BAA2 Upgrade</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management also has been buying back stock pretty aggressively recently, with $148 million worth of shares repurchased in Q4 alone, which delivered $0.05 per share in NAV accretion. For an externally managed BDC, that is a pretty noteworthy buyback and is being done at a discount that is creating significant value for shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of that, the company's balance sheet remains in solid shape with a 1.19 times debt-to-equity ratio, which is below their upper target limit of 1.25 times, and with $4.2 billion in total liquidity, as well as a weighted average debt maturity of 4.3 years. Moreover, Moody's just upgraded the company in January to Baa2, giving it one of the strongest credit ratings in the BDC space. That is an additional vote of confidence in the quality of OBDC's balance sheet and investment portfolio. The company's debt maturities are also well laddered, with maturities staggered nicely over the next several years and the vast majority of their debt not coming due until 2029 or later.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721333116328309.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Investor Presentation\" width=\"331\" height=\"455\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"331\" data-height=\"455\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721333116328309.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721333116328309.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Cut Ahead?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving forward, we expect the company to face near-term net interest income headwinds from additional Federal Reserve rate cuts, continued loan repayments that they have to reinvest into new loans that are at less positive spreads, and them having to refinance some debt this year that has matured at interest rates that are materially lower than what they'll be able to refinance them at in the current market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That being said, they can also repurchase shares, which should be accretive to both NAV and adjusted net investment income, and they're taking additional steps to try to reduce financing costs while also investing in specialty finance and joint venture opportunities that are less rate sensitive and have been generating very strong returns on equity. OBDC is also generating solid net investment income yields, with its most recent quarter posting an adjusted NII of $0.36 per share, which amounts to a 12.4% annualized adjusted NII yield on the current cost.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, however, we expect the dividend to be cut this year due to the fact that the base dividend already exceeds the company's adjusted NII ($0.37 vs. $0.36), and that gap should only widen moving forward due to the aforementioned factors. That being said, it will probably only have to be cut by 10% to 20%, which, given the current yield, means that the dividend yield on current cost should remain above 10% this year. If the company decides to make a deeper cut to its base dividend than that, it will likely pay out substantial supplemental distributions, which would still bring the effective yield on cost to above 10%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, if the company continues to lean into debt buybacks or share repurchases, that should help prop up NAV per share, especially if their underwriting performance remains solid. Management gave every indication that they plan to continue buying back stock as they expanded their authorization to $300 million. As management stated on the latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872219-blue-owl-capital-corporation-obdc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872219-blue-owl-capital-corporation-obdc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">earnings call</a>, they're,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>going to actively look at comparing buying stock versus deploying capital into the market. </em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, insider buying has been quite strong in recent months, which indicates management's conviction in the portfolio area.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721339448548846_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"722\" data-height=\"393\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721339448548846_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"OBDC Insider Purchases\" width=\"640\" height=\"348\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"348\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721339448548846_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721339448548846_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721339448548846_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721339448548846_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">OBDC Insider Purchases <span>(Insider Cow)</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks Investors Cannot Ignore</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, OBDC does have risks to keep in mind. Not only could a dividend cut potentially reduce sentiment on the stock (though this has been happening across the BDC space, and it has not impacted shares much at all recently due to the floating rate nature of their underlying holdings, which I recently detailed <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4867850-why-bdc-dividend-cuts-arent-the-red-flag-investors-think\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4867850-why-bdc-dividend-cuts-arent-the-red-flag-investors-think\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>), there is also a risk of credit deterioration. Therefore, if internal risk ratings of 3 to 5, and especially 4 to 5, begin to spike, that could be a sign that the company's health is deteriorating markedly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, OBDC does have exposure to software, with it making up 11.1% of its portfolio. Therefore, if software truly gets disrupted by AI, that could also weaken the company's underwriting portfolio. That said, OBDC takes precautions with its software lending and has an excellent track record in the sector, so I'm not too concerned about that. It is worth noting that management emphasized on the earnings call that the loan-to-value ratios on their software loans are in the 30%, which adds an additional margin of safety to that section of OBDC's portfolio.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why the Market May Be Getting OBDC Completely Wrong</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I believe that OBDC is likely headed for a dividend cut, but investors are still going to likely enjoy a double-digit yield on current cost while being able to buy shares at a huge discount to net asset value despite the company selling a substantial portion of its underlying loans in line with the marks that they received from the third-party valuation agency and also engaging in fairly substantial buybacks. It also trades at a much bigger discount than its historical average has been, and just last July it traded roughly in line with its NAV, despite its underlying fundamentals today being nearly identical to where they were then.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721340752336204_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2940\" data-height=\"1960\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721340752336204_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"tikr.com\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"427\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721340752336204_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721340752336204_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721340752336204_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47771937-17721340752336204_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>tikr.com</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, I think OBDC warrants a strong buy rating right now, especially given that it trades at a huge discount to sector peers like Ares Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARCC\" title=\"Ares Capital\">ARCC</a>), which has a similarly positioned portfolio and is putting up similar strong overall numbers, as I recently detailed <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871971-the-hidden-math-behind-ares-capital-beating-oaktree-specialty-lending\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871971-the-hidden-math-behind-ares-capital-beating-oaktree-specialty-lending\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While it is not one of my very favorite BDCs at the moment, it is on my watch list for potential inclusion in my 7% to 8% yielding <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/47771937-samuel-smith/6260780-our-portfolio-track-record-results-through-february-14-2026\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/47771937-samuel-smith/6260780-our-portfolio-track-record-results-through-february-14-2026\" target=\"_blank\">total return outperforming</a> and below-market beta portfolio at <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1369-high-yield-investor\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1369-high-yield-investor\" target=\"_blank\">High Yield Investor</a>.</p>",

Since then, the case for nuclear energy has only become more cemented, though short-term risks are growing too, as valuations get stretched. All of this is discussed below.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fresh Developments Highlight Nuclear Energy </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To start with, let's first look at the new developments that highlight the potential for nuclear energy to make further gains at the stock market this year. These are the latest tariff challenges, which could exempt uranium and the big tech's massive CapEx plans for 2026. Both are discussed below.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tariff Troubles Highlight Uranium</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Supreme Court's striking down tariffs imposed by Trump administration last year might have led the stock markets to cheer, but the joy was short-lived. The Trump administration quickly imposed a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2026/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-a-temporary-import-duty-to-address-fundamental-international-payment-problems/\" rel=\"nofollow\">blanket 10% tariff</a>, which could be increased further to 15%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While confusion has ensued and retaliation from trade partners around the world is to be expected, some sectors are spared. In its latest statement on tariffs, the White House says \"Some goods will not be subject to the temporary import duty because of the needs of the U.S. economy...including...certain critical minerals...\". This could well include uranium, which was once again brought into the fray as a critical mineral last year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This in turn suggests that while other sectors struggle, uranium can continue to look attractive. This further backs up the key raw material for nuclear energy production, which already had good prospects earlier for two reasons:</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Government Stake in Critical Mineral Companies</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Energy security has been a key concern of the Trump administration. To this extent, it has even acquired stakes in companies like rare earths' producers like MP Materials Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MP\" title=\"MP Materials Corp.\">MP</a>) and lithium miner Lithium Americas Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LAC\" title=\"Lithium Americas Corp.\">LAC</a>). With uranium a critical mineral now, it's entirely possible that it could do so in a uranium miner, like enCore Energy Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EU\" title=\"enCore Energy Corp.\">EU</a>) for example, as well. This in turn can send uranium stocks rallying. </p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Uranium Price Sees A Nice Rise</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Uranium miners' prices are closely tied to those of the commodity, which has done rather well this year so far. It even breached the $100/lb mark last month, before dropping from those levels. Even now, though, its price is up some 30% YoY. If the trend continues, it also bodes well for uranium stocks this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48723034-17720480588054042_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1497\" data-height=\"869\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48723034-17720480588054042_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Uranium price\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"372\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48723034-17720480588054042_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48723034-17720480588054042_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48723034-17720480588054042_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48723034-17720480588054042_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Trading Economics</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's worth noting in this context that the uranium focused ETF, the Global X Uranium ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/URA\" title=\"Global X Uranium ETF\">URA</a>) is up by 31% YTD, a bigger increase than the 21.2% seen for even NLR. This indicates that investors interested in nuclear energy might want to look at uranium only stocks and ETFs, at least for 2026 as well. That said, NLR is unlikely to be left behind either since six of the ETF's top 10 holdings are in uranium miners. </p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Big Tech's Power Demand Promise</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next supportive development for nuclear energy is the planned capex spends by hyperscalers to fund their AI ambitions. Amazon.com, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), for example, has set a $200 billion target for 2026, which is over 50% increase from last year. Alphabet Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) could spend up to $185 billion, while Meta Platforms, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) expects the number to be at $135 billion. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the heads under AI spends is infrastructure development, which implies the potential for more collaborations between big tech and nuclear energy producers. Already, agreements have been struck between Microsoft Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) and Constellation Energy Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CEG\" title=\"Constellation Energy Corporation\">CEG</a>) as well as Amazon, and Talen Energy Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TLN\" title=\"Talen Energy Corporation\">TLN</a>) and Dominion Energy, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/D\" title=\"Dominion Energy, Inc.\">D</a>). Even as recently as early January, Meta signed a power agreement with Vistra Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VST\" title=\"Vistra Corp.\">VST</a>) as well as with Oklo Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKLO\" title=\"Oklo Inc.\">OKLO</a>). </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While it's estimated that <a href=\"https://trellis.net/article/what-metas-big-nuclear-deals-say-about-corporate-clean-energy-strategy/#:~:text=They%20accounted%20for%2017%20percent,not%20new%2C%E2%80%9D%20McCormick%20said.\" rel=\"nofollow\">at least some 13 GW</a> worth of deals have been contracted by big tech companies so far, the expected demand is much higher, as the chart below shows. More deals with nuclear energy companies can continue to encourage stocks in the sector upwards. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48723034-17720446635245948_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"675\" data-height=\"455\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48723034-17720446635245948_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Power Demand\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"431\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48723034-17720446635245948_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48723034-17720446635245948_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48723034-17720446635245948_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48723034-17720446635245948_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Deloitte </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Continued Policy Push</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More generally, the policy push in the US, the biggest consumer of nuclear energy worldwide, continues into 2026 after last year saw a target increase of 4x in nuclear energy generation by 2025. In a release early in the year, <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/fact-sheet-energy-department-delivering-accelerating-deployment-nuclear-power\" rel=\"nofollow\">the government said</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The Department of Energy (DOE) is fully committed to unleashing America’s next nuclear renaissance, from reinvigorating domestic supply chains to delivering gigawatts of new reactors.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Along with this, it says a $2.7 billion investment has been announced to expand LEU production and also support innovations in HALEU. In other words, the year have already started with positive activity on the government front. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rising Risk, but Long-term Looks Better</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the run-up in NLR, its TTM P/E ratio is <a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/uranium-nuclear-energy-etf-nlr/portfolio/\" rel=\"nofollow\">at 30.4x, </a>which is higher than that for the S&amp;P 500 at 28.3x. Even factoring in the premium on nuclear energy, going by its prospects, the comparison seems to suggest that the sector could be close to fairly priced. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, a look at the stock metrics for NLR's biggest 10 holdings, which account for over 66% of the total weight, show that overvaluation compared to their five-year averages. Cameco Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCJ\" title=\"Cameco Corporation\">CCJ</a>), for example, has a forward P/E of 105.5x for 2026, compared to the already high five-year average of 82.3x. Of the five stocks for which the figures are available, only PG&amp;E Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PCG\" title=\"PG&amp;E Corporation\">PCG</a>) has a relatively subdued forward P/E. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48723034-17721020263122659_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1723\" data-height=\"705\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48723034-17721020263122659_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Stock metrics for biggest 10 holdings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"262\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48723034-17721020263122659_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48723034-17721020263122659_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48723034-17721020263122659_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48723034-17721020263122659_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the longer-term, however, the forward P/Es look vastly improved. Besides Cameco, Constellation and PG&amp;E also look attractive, while BWX Technologies, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BWXT\" title=\"BWX Technologies, Inc.\">BWXT</a>) looks fairly priced. Of the four other stocks for which forward P/Es become available for 2030, Dension Mines Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DNN\" title=\"Denison Mines Corp.\">DNN</a>) and Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEG\" title=\"Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated\">PEG</a>) also look alright, especially as their valuations run lower than even that the S&amp;P 500's five-year average at 22.7x. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Next?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The opportunity indicated by incredible developments in nuclear energy's favor, after it spent a decade inert following the Fukushima incident, makes NLR still a tempting buy for 2026. However, the ETF's and its biggest stock holdings' metrics suggest otherwise. </p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors with a long-term perspective can still do well to buy ETF, but those with a shorter term time frame in mind should brace for fluctuations, even though there could be more than one reason that leads to rallies in nuclear energy stocks this year.

But what happens when the market drops 50%? Warren Buffett once remarked that if you can't handle that kind of drawdown, you shouldn't be in stocks. In good times, investors invariably overestimate their risk tolerance. But when volatility strikes, the immense emotional pressure can cause investors to make suboptimal investing decisions under duress.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is why it is especially important to examine one's investment plans and capacity for risk when markets are calm, rather than when they are in turmoil. Investors who want to capture expected returns over the long term need to mentally and financially prepare for bad times and hold assets they're not going to panic sell even when things are not working out as expected.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Importance of Avoiding FOMO</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the most important lessons in investing is to avoid the \"fear of missing out\", or FOMO for short. As the legendary J.P. Morgan (allegedly) once said, \"<strong><em>Nothing so undermines your financial judgment</em> as the <em>sight</em> of <em>your neighbor getting rich</em></strong>.\" A related quote from Charlie Munger is, \"<em>The world is not driven by greed; it's driven by envy</em>\".</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As an investor, it's important to ask yourself honestly: can I resist the impulse to chase the hottest trends? If not, then it becomes even more important to have an investment plan in place - one that you can stick to both in good times and bad.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FOMO is a powerful driver of bubbles, but they always pop eventually. In fact, it's the popping that ultimately confirms that it was a bubble in the first place. For example, after COVID, remote working health and fitness exercise companies such as Zoom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZM\" title=\"Zoom Communications, Inc.\">ZM</a>), Peloton (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PTON\" title=\"Peloton Interactive, Inc.\">PTON</a>), and Teledoc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TDOC\" title=\"Teladoc Health, Inc.\">TDOC</a>) boomed, then crashed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/12/27546953-17630086166471806.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Data\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"364\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/12/27546953-17630086166471806.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/12/27546953-17630086166471806.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/12/27546953-17630086166471806.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCharts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before that, we saw a craze in 3D printing stocks that promised to change the world, like 3D Systems (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DDD\" title=\"3D Systems Corporation\">DDD</a>) and Stratasys (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSYS\" title=\"Stratasys Ltd.\">SSYS</a>), which were 10- or even 20-baggers before returning to earth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/12/27546953-17630086193260045.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Data\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"364\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/12/27546953-17630086193260045.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/12/27546953-17630086193260045.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/12/27546953-17630086193260045.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCharts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And during the shale boom, sand manufacturers like Emerge Energy Services (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EMES\" title=\"Harbor Emerging Markets Select ETF\">EMES</a>) made a fortune from supplying sand for oil and gas fracking.

He <a href=\"https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/memo/on-bubble-watch\" rel=\"nofollow\">writes</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>In my view, a bubble not only reflects a rapid rise in stock prices, but it is a temporary mania characterized by – or, perhaps better, resulting from – the following:</p> <ul> <li><p>highly irrational exuberance (to borrow a term from former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan),</p></li> <li><p>outright adoration of the subject companies or assets, and a belief that they can’t miss,</p></li> <li><p>massive fear of being left behind if one fails to participate (‘‘FOMO’’), and</p></li> <li><p>resulting conviction that, for these stocks, “there’s no price too high.”</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>“No price too high” stands out to me in particular. </strong>When you can’t imagine any flaws in the argument and are terrified that your officemate/golf partner/brother-in-law/competitor will own the asset in question and you won’t, it’s hard to conclude there’s a price at which you shouldn’t buy.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Marks further writes that the very conditions that lead to the formation of bubbles also eventually cause them to collapse:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><strong>When something is on the pedestal of popularity, the risk of a decline is high.</strong> When people assume – and price in – an expectation that things can only get better, the damage done by negative surprises is profound. When something is new, the competitors and disruptive technologies have yet to arrive. The merit may be there, but if it’s overestimated it can be overpriced, only to evaporate when reality sets in. In the real world, trees don’t grow to the sky.</p></blockquote> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">US Equity Outperformance Is Not Guaranteed</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The siren call to ditch diversification between stocks and fixed income, or between US stocks and international stocks, has never been stronger. After all, the US stock market has delivered extraordinary returns in recent memory. Since the market bottom at the depths of the Great Financial Crisis, the S&amp;P 500 (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a></span>) has delivered +1280% returns, far outpacing international equities (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACWX\" title=\"iShares MSCI ACWI ex US ETF\">ACWX</a>) at +428% or the aggregate investment-grade bond market (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AGG\" title=\"iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF\">AGG</a>) at +63%.

Indeed, the US is home to many of the world's largest and most profitable firms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, it is equally important to acknowledge that the majority of this outperformance has come not from stronger fundamental growth, but from rising valuations. Research from Cliff Asness at AQR shows that when adjusting for valuation expansion, the long-term performance gap between the US and international markets largely disappears (see \"<a href=\"https://www.aqr.com/Insights/Perspectives/The-Long-Run-Is-Lying-to-You\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Long Run Is Lying To You</a>\"):</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>It’s common knowledge that the stock market in the USA has crushed the rest of the world (I’ll use EAFE here to proxy for non-U.S. developed market equities) since the peak of the Japan bubble (call that the end of 1989) or over the last, say, ten years, right? Well, yes. But here we are interested in how much of the outperformance is from the USA’s fundamentals (or perhaps carry) beating the rest of the world versus the USA’s valuations richening versus the rest of the world... We see a giant repricing with the USA getting relatively much more expensive on CAPE and ending effectively at a peak.</p> <p>When we adjust for the change in relative valuation, the return differential shrinks from an economically (if not statistically) significant 2.1% per annum to an insignificant (both ways) forty basis points. <em><strong>The victory of the USA over EAFE for the last forty years is almost entirely coming from it getting relatively more expensive</strong></em>.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here's another chart of the P/E of US stocks vs. international stocks, showing significant divergence from 2009 onward. From a similar starting point in 2009, US stocks are now valued around 10 turns of P/E higher than international stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/13/27546953-1763025554732575_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Data\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/13/27546953-1763025554732575_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/13/27546953-1763025554732575_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/13/27546953-1763025554732575_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/13/27546953-1763025554732575_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Yardeni</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unless one believes that US stocks will continue becoming more expensive relative to international stocks, this historical outperformance is unlikely to continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Remember, higher starting valuations are associated with lower future returns. As this chart from JPMorgan below shows, the correlation between S&amp;P 500 forward PE and subsequent 10-year returns shows a clear negative relationship based on data from 1988-2014.

As Larry Swedroe writes in <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/should-long-term-investors-be-100-equities\" rel=\"nofollow\">Should Long-Term Investors Be 100% in Equities?</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>There are several key takeaways for investors. First, they must accept that stocks will not always beat bonds, no matter the investment horizon. That is only logical because stocks are riskier, and while that risk should result in an ex-ante premium, if stocks always outperformed, there would be no risk and no risk premium! Said another way, there can be no equity risk premium if stocks are not risky, regardless of the horizon. Second, diversification of risk across unique assets is always a prudent strategy. Third, an investment policy statement should be tailored to an individual’s unique ability, willingness, and need to take risk, taking into account their capacity (both from a financial and psychological standpoint) to withstand the risks of severe equity drawdowns.</p></blockquote> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Are We In a Bubble?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We might be, or we might not be. The bursting of bubbles is only obvious in hindsight. Still, there are several warning signs. The first is the high valuation of US stocks.

Their strength has created a rising tide that has lifted all boats, allowing even less profitable or slower-growing companies in the S&amp;P 500 to trade at elevated valuations. Marks writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Because of these companies’ greatness, their stocks are highly valued, and there’s a popular perception that their elevated valuations are responsible for the S&amp;P 500’s unusually high average p/e ratio. The fact is their p/e ratios average out to roughly 33. This is certainly an above average figure, but I don’t find it unreasonable when viewed against what I believe to be the companies’ exceptional products, significant market shares, high incremental profit margins, and strong competitive moats... I think it’s the average p/e ratio of 22 on the 493 non-Magnificent companies in the index – well above the mid-teens average historical p/e for the S&amp;P 500 – that renders the index’s overall valuation so high and possibly worrisome.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other metrics, such as the price-to-sales ratio of over 3.3 or the \"Buffett Indicator\" (market capitalization relative to GDP), are also at the highest levels ever recorded.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second is that the US stock market is being dominated by an increasingly small number of companies.

However, if these handful of expensive and widely held stocks decline, it could lead to a substantial drop in the entire market, far surpassing the effect of previous bubbles popping.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third, investor sentiment appears to be overly optimistic. Every dip since 2009 has been eagerly bought, including the rapid rebound from the short-lived COVID crash. There also seems to be an underlying assumption that either the Federal Reserve or the government will always be able to jump in to save the day whenever trouble arises. As a result, it's been a very long time since excessive risk-taking has been punished. Supporting this view, another chart from The Worker Advocate's latest missive shows that margin balances are at all-time highs - a sign of investor confidence or perhaps complacency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/5/10779721-17623516628028917_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Data\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"342\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/5/10779721-17623516628028917_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/5/10779721-17623516628028917_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/5/10779721-17623516628028917_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/5/10779721-17623516628028917_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Finra</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fourth, the risk is compounded by the fact that market leadership is not only concentrated in a handful of stocks but also predominantly within a single sector: technology. Only two of the current top 10 stocks, JP Morgan (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM\" title=\"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.\">JPM</a>) and Berkshire, are non-NASDAQ-listed stocks. If AI growth were to slow or disappoint, there could be a reckoning in the valuations of this entire sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Adding to this vulnerability is the circular financing model emerging in the AI ecosystem. For example, OpenAI wants to buy Nvidia's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) chips, but it doesn't have enough cash to do so since it's still losing billions of dollars a year. So what does NVDA do? It invests capital into OpenAI, effectively helping to fund OpenAI's operations so that it can, in turn, afford to buy its chips. This type of vendor financing creates a self-reinforcing feedback loop, where suppliers like Nvidia are simultaneously customers, investors, and beneficiaries of their clients' successes. However, if demand slows or expectations reset, the entire ecosystem could unravel quickly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/14/27546953-17630986656950748_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Data\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"652\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/14/27546953-17630986656950748_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/14/27546953-17630986656950748_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/14/27546953-17630986656950748_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/14/27546953-17630986656950748_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Counterpoints: Why This Might Not Be a Bubble</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's important to be able to view both sides of an argument. Some anti-bubble points are:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>CAPE is a lagging measure since it compares current prices to the average of the last 10 years of earnings. With AI potentially driving explosive future earnings, the currently elevated P/E ratio could compress organically as the \"E\" grows.</li> <li>Some of the most well-known valuation experts are not yet calling a bubble. Cliff Asness <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-10/aqr-s-cliff-asness-sees-expensive-stock-market-but-no-bubble\" rel=\"nofollow\">remarked</a> that US stocks are historically expensive but not yet in bubble territory. Howard Marks called US stock valuations \"lofty but not nutty”. Overall P/E ratios are still below the heights of the dot-com or Nifty-Fifty bubbles.</li> <li>The dominance of tech stocks may mean that traditional measures of valuation are no longer relevant. For example, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio can undervalue technology companies because their value is primarily derived from intangible assets, such as intellectual property and customer base. Buffett's market cap-to-GDP ratio may understate value for corporations with significant overseas earnings.</li> </ol> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">So What Should We Do?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We're not calling for an imminent crash, nor are we going 100% to cash. But we believe that it is prudent to think about getting more defensive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Buffett's aphorism comes to mind: \"<em><strong>Be fearful when others are greedy &amp; greedy when others are fearful\".</strong> </em>Berkshire Hathaway's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.B</a>) own cash hoard last quarter stood at a whopping $380 billion, reflecting Buffett's cautious approach in an elevated market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last several years have been extremely rewarding for investors, and if you've been a beneficiary of this market trend, there's no reason to continue dialing up the risk if you're already meeting your investment goals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we've discussed before, our portfolios are not designed to beat the S&amp;P 500, even though it's fairly easy to do so over the very long term by leveraging the index (see <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4710893-how-to-simply-beat-the-s-and-p-500-over-the-long-run-but-why-we-dont-do-it\">How To Simply Beat The S&amp;P 500 Over The Long Run (But Why We Don't Do It)</a>).</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>If one had both an infinite time horizon and unconstrained risk tolerance, then they could simply invest in a leveraged version of the S&amp;P 500 or Nasdaq and have a near-certain chance of beating the market over a sufficiently long time interval. However, these conditions are not met for most real-life investors... There are real-life obligations, such as retirement, housing or medical expenses. Having to liquidate a stock-heavy portfolio at market lows to fund an emergency expense could be devastating for an investor's financial well-being.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Instead, our goal has always been to generate 8-10% annual returns from a diversified portfolio, driven by a combination of dividend yield and alpha-producing strategies such as CEF rotation and corporate actions. Since inception in 2017, our <em>Income Generator</em> and <em>Tactical Income-100</em> portfolios have delivered over 10% total return per year, despite holding meaningful allocations to both fixed income and international equities. This diversification should continue to serve us well if US stocks take a downturn, although the timing of this can never be predicted. That said, it's also important to be aware that portfolio returns will likely be lower in a prolonged bear market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Importantly, being \"aggressive\" or \"defensive\" is not a binary, all-or-nothing decision. Howard Marks has outlined 6 levels of defense, ranging from mild caution to extreme bearishness. His barometer is currently set at \"INVESTCON 5\", corresponding to a reduction of aggressive holdings and an increase of defensive holdings:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p></p> <ul> <li>6. Stop buying</li> <li>5. Reduce aggressive holdings and increase defensive holdings</li> <li>4. Sell off the remaining aggressive holdings</li> <li>3. Trim defensive holdings as well</li> <li>2. Eliminate all holdings</li> <li>1. Go short</li> </ul> <p>In my view, it's essentially impossible to reasonably reach the degree of certainty needed to implement INVESTCON 3, 2, or 1. Because “overvaluation” is never synonymous with “sure to go down soon,” it’s rarely wise to go to those extremes. I know I never have. <strong>But I have no problem thinking it’s time for INVESTCON 5.</strong> And if you lighten up on things that appear historically expensive and switch into things that appear safer, there may be relatively little to lose from the market continuing to grind higher for a while . . . or anyway not enough to lose sleep over.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A key point is that even if the market were to grind higher, defensive holdings will still partially benefit while at the same time affording a degree of protection should markets go south. It's also important to mentally prepare for the possibility that markets may continue to rise after you've taken a more defensive stance - and to be at peace with that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One way to reduce the emotional pressure of making defensive adjustments is to take a gradual approach. Just like dollar-cost averaging smooths entry into markets, a gradual shift toward more conservative positions can help minimize regret if markets keep climbing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With our CEF portfolios, there are certain actions that we could potentially take to become more defensive.</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Reducing the allocation to leveraged CEFs.</li> <li>Reducing equity CEF allocation while increasing fixed income CEF exposure.</li> <li>Favoring investment grade over speculative fixed income classes.</li> <li>Allow the cash balance from distributions to accumulate instead of deploying it immediately.</li> <li>Continuing to engage in alpha-generating strategies such as CEF rotation and corporate actions, which should do well in any market environment.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, we don't anticipate wholesale changes. Our portfolios are already designed to be all-weather by nature, diversified across asset classes and geographies.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h3> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's easy to believe that diversification and risk management are unnecessary when US stocks are delivering strong returns year after year. But these are precisely the moments when it's most important to stay grounded in your investment plan and avoid the lure of FOMO. Investing isn't just about maximizing gains in good times - it's also about surviving the bad times without making costly psychological mistakes. The goal isn't to avoid risk entirely, but to stay invested in a way that captures some upside participation while reducing downside exposure.</p>",

In reality, looking at the valuations, in my opinion it does. The fund’s aggregate ROE is 12.86%, which already indicates positive average quality in the selection. But yield trap is typically measured by the sustainability of the yield. So I calculate the aggregate payout ratio: considering a forward P/E of about 14x, I first calculate the Earnings Yield as 1/P/E of 7.1%. Considering that the dividend yield is about 4.3-4.6%, it means that, making a very rough estimate, the payout ratio will be 4.4% / 7.1% ≈ 62%. This is not extreme, on the contrary it is in a fairly neutral zone. I would have considered it extreme if it had exceeded the 80% area. Naturally, it is a proxy: let’s not forget that about 20% of the ETF is in REITs, which are structures that distribute based on FFO, not EPS, and are required to distribute 90%. In this sense, using forward P/E is somewhat forced. However, it still gives an approximate dimension of the quality of the distributions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/58581242-1772043870579772_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"938\" data-height=\"518\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/58581242-1772043870579772_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SPHD: dividend yield\" width=\"640\" height=\"353\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/58581242-1772043870579772_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/58581242-1772043870579772_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/58581242-1772043870579772_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/58581242-1772043870579772_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">SPHD: dividend yield <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Compounding Problem</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What will the return depend on then?

Moreover, today, especially utilities and staples, are trading at <a href=\"https://www.isabelnet.com/sector-valuations/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiples above the 90th percentile</a> of the 10- and 30-year historical series.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/58581242-17720444811126165_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1322\" data-height=\"478\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/58581242-17720444811126165_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SPHD total return\" width=\"640\" height=\"231\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/58581242-17720444811126165_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/58581242-17720444811126165_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/58581242-17720444811126165_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/58581242-17720444811126165_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">SPHD total return <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the end, it is the process at the base of the economic cycle: monetary and fiscal expansion, in the face of such large global public debt, typically also leads to inflation, and presumably economic expansion.

But also that this structure underlying SPHD will continue in the long term to work against performance compared to other alternatives available on the market. In this sense, I confirm the quant rating by saying that in my opinion it makes sense to maintain a HOLD rating on SPHD.</p>",

Let’s begin.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Fund</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">iShares MSCI Europe Financials ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EUFN\" title=\"iShares MSCI Europe Financials ETF\">EUFN</a>) aims to provide exposure to financial companies in Europe. The ETF passively tracks the benchmark- <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239645/ishares-msci-europe-financials-etf\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSCI Europe Financials Index</a> which is meant to track large and mid-cap <a href=\"https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/255599/msci-europe-financials-index-net.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">representation</a> of the financial sector in Europe across 15 Developed Markets in Europe. The <a href=\"https://www.etfrc.com/EUFN\" rel=\"nofollow\">weighting</a> is market cap based, and around 95% of the holdings are classified as large cap (above $10 billion). The <a href=\"https://www.msci.com/indexes/index/106649\" rel=\"nofollow\">median</a> constituent market cap is $21.54 billion. The total number of constituents is 85. The fund is not currency hedged, so the investors are borne with the currency risk of the euro fluctuating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding the fund, the expense ratio is 49 basis points and it earns a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EUFN/expenses\">C+ Seeking Alpha</a> Expense grade. Liquidity is great, with an average daily dollar volume on a 3-month basis around $55 million and an AUM of $4.4 billion, ranking it with an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EUFN/liquidity\">A Seeking Alpha</a> Grade. The fund’s inception date is January 20<em>th</em> 2010, providing a long track record. EUFN is rated highly in terms of the Dividend Grade also, highlighted by the 3.49% dividend yield and 15 consecutive years of dividend payments, earning it an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EUFN/dividends/scorecard\">A Dividend Grade</a>. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of holdings, around 99% of the fund is invested in equity, with all of it being, obviously the Financials industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53538703-17720462815185704.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"605\" height=\"193\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53538703-17720462815185704.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53538703-17720462815185704.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53538703-17720462815185704.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going deeper, regarding sector allocation within the industry, the majority of the fund is invested in the banking sector with 57.49%, the insurance industry with 24% and Financial Services with 18.11%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53538703-1772046287608472_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1313\" data-height=\"258\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53538703-1772046287608472_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" width=\"640\" height=\"126\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53538703-1772046287608472_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53538703-1772046287608472_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53538703-1772046287608472_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53538703-1772046287608472_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>iShares</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EUFN represents a unique investment vehicle in the sense that it is a U.S. listed ETF offering targeted financials industry exposure in Europe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53538703-17720462978989387.png?io=w640\" alt=\"tablle\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"625\" height=\"332\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53538703-17720462978989387.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53538703-17720462978989387.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53538703-17720462978989387.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, the fund is rated highly in nearly all the Seeking Alpha grade categories, acing all A’s except the Expenses category which we discussed earlier.

Firstly, the ECB's rate position is in a hold period, which is favorable for bank margins in Europe. The ECB has maintained its rates at the same <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/interest-rate\" rel=\"nofollow\">level</a> since June 2025. Its deposit facility rate has been at 2%, while its main refinancing rate has been at 2.15%. There are no expectations of a change in its course in the near future due to the strength of the Eurozone economy. This means that European lenders are able to earn net interest income at levels far above the near zero levels that have been experienced for years prior to this without the concern of additional compression. In fact, about 85% of economists <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/05/ecb-rate-decision-economists-analysts-next-move.html\" rel=\"noopener\">polled</a> by Reuters in their January poll expect that the ECB will keep its rates steady over the rest of 2026, which gives banks an unusually high level of visibility with regards to their future earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Accelerating loan growth is another near-term tailwind. Credit growth to businesses was <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/loan-growth/news/521103\" rel=\"nofollow\">running</a> near its multi-year high and loan growth to households has <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/loan-growth\" rel=\"nofollow\">climbed</a> to its highest since February of 2023, suggesting that demand for credit is finally translating into volume growth that complements margin strength.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The massive fiscal expansion undertaken by European nations on defense and infrastructure is another <a href=\"https://anderseninstitute.org/rearmament-is-an-opportunity-to-strengthen-europes-financial-markets/\" rel=\"nofollow\">structural</a> driver that goes far beyond the short term. The increase in government debt to fund defense spending across all members of NATO creates additional government bond issuance to support bank treasury functions.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Valuation</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the extraordinary year financials in Europe experienced in 2025, the beginning of 2026 finds the group not as a deep-value turnaround play but as a group whose valuation is beginning to look towards the fairly valued range.

The currency risk is arguably the most immediate structural headwind facing the fund. As an unhedged investment, any appreciation of the value of the Euro relative to the value of the U.S. Dollar will have the beneficial result of increasing USD-denominated investment returns, as has been the case in 2025 and early 2026; conversely, any weakening of the relative value of the Euro could have an adverse impact on investment returns for American investors even if underlying European bank stocks remain stable. Macroeconomic vulnerability in Europe is still a concern. Growth forecasts, while revised upwards recently, are still low. ECB staff projections <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2025/html/ecb.mp251218~58b0e415a6.en.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">forecast</a> only 1.4% euro area GDP growth in 2025 and 1.2% in 2026, which is still a question whether it could drive strong credit demand. A possible worsening scenario due to tariff shocks, a German industrial slowdown, or a new energy crisis could easily feed through into non-performing loans and provisioning. Geopolitical risk is of course present. The ECB itself has cautioned about geopolitical uncertainty and its impact on financial markets and the stability in the euro area.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion </strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EUFN has a compelling but maturing investment thesis. Its absolute and relative valuation compared to U.S. peers and the broader European market still indicates a favorable upside over. However, the biggest swings in the investment thesis will come from the ECB's next move, European GDP growth rates, and the euro exchange rate. If investors are willing to accept currency risk and a degree of geopolitical uncertainty, they are well rewarded with a yield of 3.5% and a potential for the Financials sector to catch up to the broader European market and US Financials sector. I would rate EUFN a BUY at current levels, with caution for periodic volatility caused by the risks discussed.</p>",

Today we reiterate a Buy and check back in on the company's performance in the latest quarter and discuss the outlook. The company delivered another great report. Let us discuss the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557121-urban-outfitters-gaap-eps-of-1_05-misses-by-0_20-revenue-of-1_8b-beats-by-10m\">just-reported Q4 results</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue was a record for Q4. It grew 9.8% from last year's Q4 to $1.80 billion and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/URBN/earnings/estimates?hasComeFromMpArticle=true&amp;source=content_type%253Areact%257Csection%253Amain_content%257Cbutton%253Abody_link#figure_type=annual#hasComeFromMpArticle=true#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\">beat consensus</a> by $11 million. Now, the one thing that we really watch for with retailers is changes in comparable sales. This is a key metric for any retailer we analyze. It is almost more important than the overall sales figure, as it shows both traffic volume and pricing power. Comps are up across the board for Urban Outfitters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We saw comparable retail segment net sales increase a strong 5.5%. The increase was a result of mid-single-digit positive growth in both digital channel sales and retail store sales. Segment-wise, we saw comparable sales increase 9.6% at Urban Outfitters branded shops, increase 5.2% at Free People branded shops, and increase 3.7% at Anthropologie branded shops. This is solid performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One big driver of recurring revenue has been the subscription model that has been recently employed versus years past. Subscription segment sales jumped 42.6% from a year ago, thanks to a huge 40.3% increase in average active subscribers since last year. We will also point out that wholesale segment sales increased 9.1%. Much of that was from a 10.2% increase in Free People branded wholesale sales. Overall, this was incredibly positive across the board and drove the sales beat. What is even more impressive besides the mostly positive comps was that margin power improved.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margins and Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sales were up nicely, as we saw, but the profit margin is another key element we need to be aware of. Well, folks, gross margin was up a strong 101 basis points, so we saw expansion. Gross profit dollars increased 13.6% from last year, hitting $599.2 million, another record, and of course up nicely from the $527.7 million last year. We saw lower markdowns than a year ago and some leverage on delivery expenses thanks to combining customer packages. That is a win.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When we consider the operating expenses of $440 million, we saw a strong income from operations of $158.7 million, up from $125 million last year. Net income hit $96.3 million, and GAAP EPS was $1.05. Of course we look to the adjusted net income, and that was $130.5 million, and adjusted EPS surged to $1.43, up from $1.04 last year. This is a win. And yes, shares deserve to be higher when we look at the chart above, as annual EPS is expanding. Adjusted net income for the year came in at $499.2 million, with EPS of $5.44. Folks, this is up from $4.03, or up 35%. One could argue it was undervalued even into the print.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking Ahead</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we saw, it was a great quarter and an even better year, and shares were at $65 before the print; that was just 12X 2025 EPS. Can the growth continue in shares and in EPS? It is the EPS gains that will drive shares higher. We think the stock is pretty cheap right here, right now, and rate shares a Buy. Why?</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, there are 14.6 million common shares remaining under the repurchase program, which can further reduce the float. The company bought back 3.3 million of them this past fiscal year. But we see strength ahead as we suspect ongoing subscription increases and see sales improving once again in 2026. Based on the momentum, current inventory, and margins that we think will remain on par with 2025, we see the 2026 fiscal year seeing total sales of $6.60-$6.75 billion. That would be about 8% growth. Not counting any repurchase activity and factoring in a commensurate operating expense increase to sales ratio, we think you'll see EPS of $5.90-6.00. This implies shares trade at just 11X FWD. The company is also debt-free with a healthy liquidity position. Take advantage of weakness and do some buying.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACMR\" title=\"ACM Research, Inc.\">ACMR</a></span>) just reported quite a disastrous end to the year if you look at how the company’s shares reacted. I don’t think such a drop was justified, but the profitability declines are<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> quite worrisome, leading me to assign it a Hold rating for now.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the last time I covered the company back in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4722867-acm-research-stock-bright-future-ahead-china-sentiment-keeping-it-down\">September of 2024,</a> I said the company had a bright future and assigned a Buy rating. Since then, even with the current profit-taking action, the company’s share price is up over 220% vs. SPY’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>) 20.6%. That was a good call indeed, but given the uncertainty right now and quite the multiples expansion, I am not so interested in starting another position again.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>By the Numbers</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue for Q4 came in at around $244m, up 9.4% y/y, and beat estimates by around $3m.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s look at the breakdown of revenues in more detail. The cleaning segment still dominates with around 65% of total revenues for the quarter, which grew 3% y/y. The ECP, Furnace &amp; Other front-end grew almost 24% to $64m, and advanced packaging grew about 24% as well, to $20.5m. Shipments for the quarter came in at $228m, which is a decline of 13.5% y/y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48589448-1772140693512413_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1994\" data-height=\"952\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48589448-1772140693512413_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ACMR Investor Slides\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"306\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48589448-1772140693512413_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48589448-1772140693512413_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48589448-1772140693512413_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48589448-1772140693512413_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ACMR Investor Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the company’s margin profile, Q4 gross margins across the board took quite the beating. A decline of over 870bps to 40.9%. For the full year, margins came in at around 44.5%, which is still within the company’s long-term range of 42%-48%. It is quite a difference from the last time I covered the company, when we saw gross margins hovering close to 50%. The reason for such a drop? Nothing concrete except for a shift in the product mix, competition, and scaling costs. All quite vague. Operating margin also took a massive hit, going from 19.3% last year to around 12.1% this quarter, over 720bps deterioration. The operating expenses grew almost 21% while revenues only grew 9.4%. Adjusted operating income got hit even more, going from 25.6% to 15.9%, a massive 970bps hit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are substantial declines, yet the management is saying they are temporary, and they expect to see these recover as the company’s new products fully ramp up. It’s good that the company gave such a wide range in its long-term gross margin, hedging its underperformance. Because of these declines, the company’s Q4 Non-GAAP EPS came in at around 25 cents, which missed estimates by a whopping 15 cents.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s move on to the company’s financial position. ACMR finished <a href=\"https://www.bamsec.com/filing/162828026011998?cik=1680062\" rel=\"nofollow\">the year</a> with around $757m in cash and equivalents, and around $400m in ST deposits and investments, against around $178m in long-term debt. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACMR/balance-sheet\">ACMR’s balance sheet</a> is very strong in my opinion. All of the debt, short-term and long-term, and long term is easily covered by the mountain of cash and ST investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of these results, the company reiterated its 2026 guidance as follows: revenue to be in the range of $1.08B to $1.175B or $1.1275B at the midpoint, which fell a little short of investors’ expectations of at least around $1.15B. These numbers imply a 20%-30% growth for the year, which is not too shabby at all. For the next quarter, revenues are expected to be around $228m vs $209m expectations and $0.34 in EPS vs $0.37 expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I’m not sure how to feel about this end of the year report. There are some positives, but clearly these positives have been overshadowed by the negatives, which is why the company’s share price plummeted over 18% as of writing this update. The massive EPS miss and rapid deterioration in profitability across the board did a number on its share price. Was it a catastrophic report that justified such a selloff? I don’t think so, but it wasn’t a pretty report, and when your share price has been steadily climbing for the last two years, anything but a perfect report will see some profit-taking action.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Comments on the Outlook</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After this report, it seems that the company will need to do a lot of work to restore investor confidence. It certainly needs to do a lot for me because the last time I covered it, I was giving it high praise due to its growth potential and profitability. Now, the profitability is a lot worse than before, which is much more important for me than the decent top-line guidance for 2026. So, what are they planning to do to restore margins?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They are banking on the company’s new products to deliver an improvement in the long-term, hopefully towards the higher end of the given margin range above, somewhere around 48%. Furnaces like PECVD, TRACK, ALD, and advanced cleaning tools like Tahoe and SPM, which have been proven to deliver 10%-15% better gross margins than semi-critical cleaners that the product mix shift towards them recently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, the company is planning to improve its supply chain to cut costs, which includes the Oregon facility expansion for localized production, as well as continuing its efforts to reduce China dependency, which was the big worry of many investors back in 2024 when I covered the company last. China still remains a large region for the company, but it is getting a lot more diversified than before.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What is interesting to see, and not at all surprising, is the product shift away from Foundry and logic, which still dominate, and much more towards memory and somewhat packaging &amp; wafer processing.

When including all distributions paid out to shareholders, the total return jumps up to 8.9% over the same time frame. BTZ now offers investors a starting dividend yield of 9.4% while issuing payouts on a monthly basis. The latest report indicates that the fund has generated sufficient income that supported distributions. While this is great for income investors, there are some trade-offs that should be considered.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3e380aee1f7837c48c298d7703cd38bd.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3e380aee1f7837c48c298d7703cd38bd.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3e380aee1f7837c48c298d7703cd38bd.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3e380aee1f7837c48c298d7703cd38bd.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For instance, the fund's allocation to credit instruments continues to be a source of stress in this high-interest-rate environment. Many of these income securities have an inverse relationship with high-interest rates, so growth is limited. Additionally, I believe the fund's net investment income needs to be substantially improved in order to improve the fund's resilience during market downturns. As it stands, the fund is heavily reliant on net realized gains to fuel its growth, which is challenging to capture during this current market environment. So let's start by taking a look at the underlying strategy that BTZ implements to generate its earnings.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Strategy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to the latest <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/240168/blackrock-credit-allocation-income-trust-usd-fund\" rel=\"nofollow\">fund overview</a>, BTZ has total managed assets of $1.55B that are spread across a diverse range of holdings. The fund has a listed expense ratio of 3.99%, which is extraordinarily high but a bit misleading. This includes fees related to interest expenses and operating costs related to some of its securities. Since BTZ is structured as a closed-end fund, BTZ is legally required to lump its expenses into its listed costs, but it isn't what investors actually pay. When excluding these other costs, the actual management fee sits at 0.96% of assets and is more reasonable considering the yield provided to investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund's primary objective is to generate a high current income for shareholders. It achieves this by allocating its assets across a variety of investment-grade credit, high-yield, non-US developed, and agency mortgage securities. Therefore, the fund essentially has no exposure to equities, and this means there should be no expectation for BTZ to stay on par with the movement of any indices. Many of its securities are directly linked to the health of the debt markets, so the fund is more likely to be influenced by interest rates rather than the movement of the indices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, the fund's share price continues to get suppressed by interest rates. The Fed initiated three separate <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4530232-fomc-cuts-interest-rate-for-third-straight-meeting\">25 basis point</a> cuts to interest rates in 2025, but the federal funds rate remains near the higher end of its ten-year range. Many of these debt-focused securities will typically share an inverse relationship with the federal funds rate, which means that valuations within BTZ's portfolio have struggled. As long as interest rates remain elevated, BTZ's growth potential may be limited. However, future interest rate cuts back to pre-pandemic levels may serve as a positive catalyst for growth in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_793942ef5c872fc36cd5e8249e38a130.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_793942ef5c872fc36cd5e8249e38a130.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_793942ef5c872fc36cd5e8249e38a130.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_793942ef5c872fc36cd5e8249e38a130.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expanding on the diversity of the fund, BTZ spreads its assets across different industries to help reduce concentration risks. As we can see below, BTZ is most heavily allocated to communications securities at 16.79% of assets. This is followed by an allocation to US agencies and consumer non-cyclical securities, which accounts for 12.51% and 12% of assets, respectively. The fund tries to focus on industries that are typically associated with reliable streams of income, which is why the allocation to technology securities makes up a smaller portion of assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720242772737727.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSU breakdown by industry\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"610\" height=\"524\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720242772737727.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720242772737727.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720242772737727.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>BlackRock</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BTZ is so large that its portfolio currently contains 1,771 different positions at this time. Despite the focus on income, BTZ's top holdings reveal a lot of notable names. Although Uniform MBS is currently the largest holding at 9.85% of assets, we can see many other traditional positions as well. For instance, this includes exposure to holdings like the Invesco Senior Loan ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BKLN\" title=\"Invesco Senior Loan ETF\">BKLN</a>), Verizon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ\" title=\"Verizon Communications Inc.\">VZ</a>), Bank of America (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC\" title=\"Bank of America Corporation\">BAC</a>), and Altria Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MO\" title=\"Altria Group, Inc.\">MO</a>), just to name a few. However, BTZ has exposure to these positions through various debt securities rather than common shares. Therefore, investors should not expect BTZ to keep up with the movement of its underlying holdings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772025283594226_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1242\" data-height=\"362\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772025283594226_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BTZ top ten holdings\" width=\"640\" height=\"187\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772025283594226_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772025283594226_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772025283594226_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772025283594226_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>BlackRock</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation &amp; Performance Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I previously covered BTZ, the fund traded at a small discount to NAV of 3.21%. Despite the minimal change in share price over the last quarter, BTZ now trades at a <a href=\"https://cefdata.com/funds/btz/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">discount to NAV</a> of 5.74%. For reference, BTZ has traded at an average discount to NAV of 5.97% over the last five years. Referring to the red line on the chart below, we can see that it appears like BTZ trades somewhere in the middle range of its price-to-NAV history. However, the data is skewed by the large decline experienced throughout 2022's market decline. When looking at the data from 2024, we can see that BTZ actually trades at a reasonable price to NAV level in relation to its recent range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721367006234782_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1083\" data-height=\"632\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721367006234782_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BTZ discount to NAV valuation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"373\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721367006234782_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721367006234782_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721367006234782_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721367006234782_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>CEF Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since my last coverage, BTZ has released an <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/resources/regulatory-documents/stream-document?stream=reg&amp;product=BTZ-AGG&amp;shareClass=NA&amp;documentId=2489228%7E1912821%7E1864346%7E1864322&amp;iframeUrlOverride=%2Fus%2Findividual%2Fliterature%2Fannual-report%2Far-retail-tax-book-one.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">updated annual report</a> for 2025. This is the only report that provides transparency into the fund's underlying earnings and NAV trajectory. Net investment income amounted to $0.71 per share, while net realized gains landed at $0.39 per share. Looking back on prior years, BTZ continues to produce net investment income within a consistent range. This can be an indication that the portfolio strategy and selected debt securities are efficient at generating income through different market cycles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the future, I would love to see net investment income support the annual distributions on its own. This approach is more likely to result in attractive price appreciation over time since the fund will no longer be reliant on net realized gains to fuel its NAV growth. As it stands right now, BTZ's reliance on net realized gains limits the overall NAV momentum of the fund. An improvement in net investment income would also improve BTZ's resilience through market declines by softening the rate of its share price erosion.

Despite market indices racing to new all-time highs through 2025, we can see how BTZ's share price growth was nonexistent. Referring to the fund's performance over the last ten years, we can see that BTZ's share price has declined by 10.1%. When including all distributions that were paid out to shareholders, the total return jumps up to 96.5% over the same time frame. Therefore, investors should anticipate that most of their returns will come from the fund's ability to maintain a high rate of payouts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_0d80cc82a37e22a3a64506193ed947c6.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_0d80cc82a37e22a3a64506193ed947c6.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_0d80cc82a37e22a3a64506193ed947c6.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_0d80cc82a37e22a3a64506193ed947c6.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interestingly, this portfolio strategy and high yield isn't always enough to protect against market declines. For instance, market indices, such as the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>), have traded sideways over the last three months with the selloff of tech. Despite BTZ's high yield, the total return still underperforms against SPY over the same time frame. The issue is that BTZ may find itself in a scenario where it is paying out more than it generates, since net realized gains are a large part of the equation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_f873f0aa4e1fb064bdde62eb70aff774.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_f873f0aa4e1fb064bdde62eb70aff774.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_f873f0aa4e1fb064bdde62eb70aff774.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_f873f0aa4e1fb064bdde62eb70aff774.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Coverage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of the latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4536590-blackrock-credit-allocation-income-trust-declares-00839-dividend\">declared</a> monthly distribution of $0.0839 per share, the current dividend yield sits around 9.4%. Looking at the dividend history below, BTZ has maintained a consistent payout over the last five-year period. This is great for investors seeking a reliable source of dividend income within their portfolio, but there are some trade-offs. Referring back to the same annual report, BTZ has only been able to generate earnings that outpaced distributions twice in the last five years. While some of the challenges may be attributed to the market's uncertainty following the pandemic and changing interest rates, I believe this is an indication that something needs to change structurally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720243693557708_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1091\" data-height=\"400\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720243693557708_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSU dividend history\" width=\"640\" height=\"235\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720243693557708_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720243693557708_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720243693557708_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720243693557708_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that BTZ's long-term performance would be greatly improved if management chose to reduce payouts to match market conditions. By choosing to keep payouts the same, this keeps investors happy, but it also continues to threaten the fund's NAV over time. The fund offers a 9.4% yield, and if management were to reduce payouts by 20%, the dividend yield would still be around ~7.5%, which remains competitive amongst the high-yield landscape.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These changes would reduce the rate at which the share price declines and also display management's priority for preserving the NAV. A reduction would also translate to more capital appreciation during those periods where BTZ captures a high level of capital appreciation. The current strategy means that more NAV erosion is likely to occur in a scenario where interest rates remain at their current levels or increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, investors need to consider the risk that the distributions received from BTZ may not be completely tax-efficient. For reference, the latest <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/literature/press-release/1-30-26-pay-date.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Section 19(a) notice</a> indicates that 67% of the latest payout was supported by net investment income, which has the greatest tax consequence for investors. Therefore, a position in BTZ is best utilized within a tax-advantaged account for investors looking to minimize their overall tax liability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720341517145138_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1195\" data-height=\"518\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720341517145138_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BTZ distribution breakdown\" width=\"640\" height=\"277\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720341517145138_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720341517145138_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720341517145138_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720341517145138_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>BTZ Section 19(a) Notice</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In conclusion, I believe that BTZ remains as a hold at this time. Although the historical price-to-NAV graph is skewed by the deep discount experienced through 2022, BTZ actually trades at a reasonable valuation. Despite this, I still don't think it's a good time to accumulate shares since the growth potential remains limited in this high-interest-rate environment. The fund provides diversity across a wide range of income-producing securities, but the underlying structure is a bit flawed. For instance, the distribution policy is a bit generous at this time since the fund has frequently paid out more than it earned. This has historically resulted in NAV deterioration, which I would like to see resolved by a slight dividend reduction and an improvement in net investment income.</p>",
