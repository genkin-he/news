The fund does reasonably well in this task, as it boasts an<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> 11.49% yield at the current share price, which is significantly higher than most other assets in the market possess. However, as is the case with all of the closed-end funds currently offered by DoubleLine, DSL achieves its objectives primarily by investing its assets into a portfolio comprised of bonds. Bonds only offer extremely limited upside when compared to common stocks, which is due to the simple fact that bonds are both issued and redeemed at their face values, so they offer no net capital gains when held over their lifetimes. As a result of this, investors in this fund should not expect to earn much beyond the distribution. Indeed, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund has delivered no share price appreciation over the past ten years, and all of the returns that it has provided to its investors have come from the distribution. With that said, though, given the fact that this fund has a substantially higher yield than any of the benchmark bond indices, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund should offer superior total returns to any exchange-traded index fund that tracks a bond index.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund Versus Bond Index Funds</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As mentioned in the introduction, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund primarily invests its assets in bonds and similar fixed-income securities. The fund’s <a href=\"https://doubleline.com/funds/income-solutions-fund/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a> states:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The Fund will seek to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a portfolio of investments selected for their potential to provide high current income, growth of capital, or both. The Fund may invest in debt securities and other income-producing investments anywhere in the world, including emerging markets.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This quote explicitly states that one thing that the fund’s management is looking for is an asset’s ability to provide growth of capital. As was mentioned in the introduction, most bonds are incapable of doing this as they are issued at face value and return the face value to their owners whenever the bond matures. As such, anyone who purchases a bond when it is first issued and holds it until it matures will have absolutely no growth of capital. Furthermore, anyone who purchases a bond at a price that is above its face value is actually guaranteed to have a negative growth of capital. It is not uncommon for bonds to trade at prices above their face values during periods of time in which interest rates are extraordinarily low. In fact, bonds will usually trade above their face values whenever the coupon rate on the bond is higher than what the same bond would have if it were issued today. Over the past fifteen years, market interest rates have typically been lower than they are today. However, prior to the financial crisis of 2008, bond yields were typically higher than during the period that followed it. As such, it has been extremely difficult, if not impossible, to actually achieve growth of capital from most bonds over the past few decades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, there are two types of bonds that can deliver growth of capital over their lifetimes. These two types are:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><span>Convertible bonds, if the bond is converted into common stock prior to its maturity date,</span></li> <li><span>Bonds that have a face value denominated in a currency that is different from the investor’s own home currency.</span></li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>It is arguable whether the second type of bond is truly delivering growth of capital. This is because the bond’s gain comes from the investor’s home currency declining against the currency in which the bond is denominated. The bond itself did not actually deliver any increase in value because it still returns the same amount that was actually lent. All that has changed is that the investor’s home currency is worth less.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund does not have any convertible bonds in its portfolio. However, it does have a number of foreign bonds.

As such, it is not using this particular asset class to generate growth of capital. It is also unlikely that the small allocation to common stocks will deliver any meaningful growth, given the companies that the fund is invested in:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699381001644_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1878\" data-height=\"514\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699381001644_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL Common Stock Holdings Dec. 31 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"175\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699381001644_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699381001644_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699381001644_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699381001644_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DSL Q1 2026 Holdings Report</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Whenever a company goes bankrupt, it will sometimes convert its outstanding debt into common stock and issue this stock to the bondholders. It seems highly likely that DSL obtained its common stock positions via this method, given that several of these firms are not publicly traded and went through bankruptcy proceedings in past years. Thus, these are not so much investments as they are common stocks that the fund simply received along the way and now has no reason to sell (or is unable to sell) for whatever reason.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund does, however, have relatively high exposure to foreign bonds. We can see that, as of December 31, 2025, fully 48.4% of the fund’s assets were invested in either foreign corporate bonds or foreign government bonds. This does not necessarily mean that these bonds are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, however. It is not uncommon for a company or a country to issue bonds denominated in U.S. dollars. In fact, this is very common among those entities that are based in emerging markets due to the simple fact that many international investors do not trust emerging market currencies. As such, the fund’s exposure to non-U.S. dollar-denominated bonds is likely lower than the 48.4% of net assets that the asset allocation chart suggests. The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund, unfortunately, does not explicitly state what its foreign currency exposure actually is. However, given that the fund did have $37,305,132 (2.7% of net assets) invested in the DoubleLine Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DBELX\" title=\"DoubleLine Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond I\">DBELX</a>) as of December 31, 2025, it does have some foreign currency exposure. We just do not know exactly how much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the above chart shows, the portfolio of the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund essentially resembles that of a global bond fund. As such, it would be most appropriate to compare the fund to global bond indices. This chart clearly shows that the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund has a substantially better yield than any of the main American or global bond indices:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Index/ETF</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Current Yield</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AGG\" title=\"iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF\">AGG</a>)</p></td> <td><p>3.85%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Bloomberg High Yield Very Liquid Index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNK\" title=\"State Street SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF\">JNK</a>)</p></td> <td><p>6.54%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Vanguard Total World Bond ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BNDW\" title=\"Vanguard Total World Bond ETF\">BNDW</a>)</p></td> <td><p>4.08%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BNDX\" title=\"Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund ETF\">BNDX</a>)</p></td> <td><p>4.35%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>J.P.

This particular index tracks the price and yield performance of speculative-grade bonds issued by corporations in the United States. In other words, it tracks the price and yield performance of bonds in which the issuer is considered to have a high risk of defaulting on the bond. <a href=\"https://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/401/junk.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">According to Moody’s</a>, a BB-rated junk bond has a 1.5% chance of defaulting in any given year, and a B-rated junk bond has a 7% chance of defaulting in any given year. Naturally, whenever a bond issuer defaults, bond investors frequently lose all of the money that they invested in the bond. Despite the relatively high default risk, the American junk bond index only yields 6.54% at the current level. It is arguable whether or not this is actually high enough to compensate investors for the risk of loss here. After all, the yield of the junk bond index is only 2.69% higher than the yield of the investment-grade bond index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AGG\" title=\"iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF\">AGG</a>), which consists of bonds that have a substantially lower risk of default.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As mentioned in the introduction, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund has a yield of 11.49% at the current share price, so it is substantially higher than that of the American junk bond index. It is unclear whether or not the fund invests in riskier assets than those included in the index in order to achieve this outcome. The fund’s website provides the following breakdown of the credit quality of the bonds that comprise its portfolio:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699389006011.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL Holdings by Credit Quality\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"619\" height=\"660\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699389006011.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699389006011.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699389006011.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DoubleLine</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of January 31, 2026, the fund had 74.12% of its total assets invested in speculative-grade bonds.

Thus, any index fund that tracks the Bloomberg High Yield Very Liquid Index will have 100% of its assets invested in junk bonds. That is a much higher allocation than DSL currently has.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the website for the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund does not break its assets down further than shown above. The website does not, for example, specify what proportion of the fund’s holdings consist of CAA1 and CAA2 bonds. It is possible that the junk bonds in the fund’s portfolio consist of the riskiest (and therefore highest-yielding) junk bonds on the market, while the JNK ETF only has a relatively small allocation to those bonds. Thus, unless DoubleLine provides a breakdown of the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund by the specific letter grades of the securities in the portfolio, we cannot be certain whether or not DSL is taking on greater risks than the index funds in order to achieve a higher yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, one thing that we can be sure of is that the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund is using leverage as a method of boosting the effective yield that it earns from its net assets. The way that this works is that the fund borrows money and then uses the money that it borrows to buy bonds and similar debt securities. It then uses the coupons that it receives from these purchased securities to pay the interest on the borrowed money. If the bonds that the fund purchased pay more than is necessary to cover the interest on the fund’s debt, the fund is allowed to keep the surplus money. This ultimately results in the yield that the fund receives as a percentage of its net assets being higher than it would be if the fund did not use leverage. The fund’s most recent holdings report states that the fund’s portfolio consisted of securities that were worth $1,748,727,149 on December 31, 2025. However, the fund also had $388,984,550 in debt that it owed on that date. The net assets were only $1,359,742,599, but it collects coupon payments on the $1.7 billion amount. Thus, the fund’s income should actually be higher than it would be if the only assets that it controlled were the ones that were purchased with its net assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most recent <a href=\"https://pex.broadridge.com/summary.asp?doctype=ann&amp;cid=dbline&amp;fid=258622109\" rel=\"nofollow\">financial statements</a> for the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund reinforce this conclusion. For the twelve-month period that ended on September 30, 2025, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund received an income of $159,818,963 from the assets in its portfolio. This is an 11.28% yield on the fund’s average net assets of $1,416,805,329 over the period. This is clearly higher than any of the bond indices provide, and indeed, it is higher than just about any individual bonds provide. Thus, we can clearly see that the fund’s leverage is providing a boost to the effective yield that it earns from its net assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As was already noted, bonds deliver essentially all of their total returns through direct payments that they make to their investors. As such, for the most part, higher yields translate into higher total returns. This is true for many bond funds as well, not just for individual bonds. As the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund has a higher yield than any of the indices, we would therefore expect it to offer higher total returns than index funds tracking the major American or global bond indices. Indeed, this is what we see, as clearly shown here:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699272076936_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1195\" data-height=\"413\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699272076936_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL vs Indices 10-Yr.

As is clearly shown, the fund managed to outperform all of the indices by a considerable margin. However, please note that the above chart assumes that an investor used the distributions that were paid out by each of these funds to purchase additional shares on the distribution payment date. This may not be a realistic assumption for bond investors, though, as many of those individuals who actually invest in bonds would prefer to take the distributions as cash.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, however, investors who actually take this fund’s distributions as cash end up disappointed. Over the past ten years, the share price of the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund declined by 29.42%.

However, the fact that the fund’s share price declined by almost 30% suggests that the fund has not consistently covered the distributions that it pays out. After all, the share price of a closed-end fund typically correlates with its net asset value (although it is not as precise of a correlation as an exchange-traded fund experiences). This statement proves to be correct in this instance, as we can see in this chart:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699284934053_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1214\" data-height=\"439\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699284934053_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL vs NAV 10-Yr.

As we can see, both exhibited a very strong correlation with one another. Furthermore, the net asset value of the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund also declined over the period, as it declined by 33.16% over the ten-year period. The fact that the fund’s net asset value declined over the period means that the fund did not manage to cover its distributions over the period. While this is certainly concerning, it is worth noting that the fund cut its distribution in late 2020 following the losses that it suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, most of the net asset value decline was due to the fund continuing to pay out distributions throughout 2020 despite the massive sell-off of bonds in March, as well as the increase in interest rates during 2022. The bond market stabilized somewhat beginning in 2023, and the fund has done a better job maintaining its distribution since that time:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699291123552_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1190\" data-height=\"418\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699291123552_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL vs NAV 3-Yr.

Indeed, the fund’s net asset value is down over the period. As such, investors may want to use caution when considering purchasing shares of the fund.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund Versus Other Bond CEFs</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As was just discussed, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund is able to employ certain strategies that allow it to earn a higher level of income and boast a higher yield than most bond index funds. This is not the only fund on the market that is able to use similar strategies, however. In fact, many closed-end bond funds are able to do so, and as a result, they are able to be much more competitive in terms of yield. We can see that here:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Fund Name</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Morningstar Classification</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Current Yield</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>11.49%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>BrandywineGLOBAL – Global Income Opportunities Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BWG\" title=\"BrandywineGLOBAL - Global Income Opptys Fd Inc\">BWG</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>11.51%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>MFS Multimarket Income Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MMT\" title=\"MFS Multimarket Income Trust\">MMT</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>8.65%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Nuveen Global High Income Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JGH\" title=\"Nuveen Global High Income Fund\">JGH</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>9.76%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>PIMCO Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PDO\" title=\"PIMCO Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund\">PDO</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>11.00%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Putnam Premier Income Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PPT\" title=\"Putnam Premier Income Trust\">PPT</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>8.60%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Western Asset Global Corporate Defined Opportunity Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GDO\" title=\"Western Asset Global Corporate Opportunity Fd Inc.\">GDO</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>12.86%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>abrdn Global Income Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCO\" title=\"abrdn Global Income Fund Inc\">FCO</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>26.17%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The median yield of this group of eight closed-end funds is 11.25%, which is slightly below the yield of the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund. Thus, the yield of this fund should seem fairly reasonable to many income investors. We can see, however, that DSL also does not have the highest yield in the peer group. At its current level, its yield is only slightly above that of the median fund in the group. There are a number of funds with higher yields and thus a number of funds that will provide their investors with a higher level of income. Many income-seeking investors might be inclined to seek out other options given this. However, the fact that this fund does not have a particularly outsized yield relative to its peers suggests that the market is not pricing in a distribution cut. If it were, then the fund’s yield would be well above the median, as is the case with the abrdn Global Income Fund. As one of the things that we look for as income investors is a sustainable income, the fact that the market does not seem to expect a distribution cut is an attractive characteristic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The correlation between yield and total return that we saw in the previous section does not necessarily apply when considering closed-end funds. As we can see here, the funds with the highest yields do not have the highest total returns over the trailing ten-year period:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Fund Name</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Trailing Ten-Year Total Return</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund</p></td> <td><p>97.04%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>BrandywineGLOBAL – Global Income Opportunities Fund</p></td> <td><p>85.08%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>MFS Multimarket Income Trust</p></td> <td><p>95.52%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Nuveen Global High Income Fund</p></td> <td><p>142.76%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>PIMCO Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund</p></td> <td><p>n/a</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Putnam Premier Income Trust</p></td> <td><p>66.40%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Western Asset Global Corporate Defined Opportunity Fund</p></td> <td><p>68.53%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>abrdn Global Income Fund</p></td> <td><p>43.40%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The highest-yielding funds in this peer group are GDO and FCO, and we can clearly see that they were not the best funds to own in terms of total return. There is a reason for this, and it comes down to the fact that a closed-end fund can overdistribute. While it is generally not a good idea for a closed-end fund that is intended to last for perpetuity (as most of them are) to pay out more than its investment profits, there are no legal restrictions that forbid them from doing so. Indeed, a closed-end fund can technically pay out as much money as it wants to until its net asset value reaches zero. This seems to be the policy of the abrdn Global Income Fund, as its net asset value has been consistently declining over the past ten years:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699297253358_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1196\" data-height=\"409\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699297253358_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FCO NAV 10-Yr.

As we already saw, this was worse than the net asset value decline suffered by the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund over the same period. Indeed, it is substantially worse. The cause of this is that the fund is distributing significantly more than it earns from its assets and destroying its net asset value in the process. As the fund’s net asset value declines, its share price also declines, and this decline in the share price offsets the high yield. As such, it is usually best to stick with a fund that is at least trying to keep its distributions in line with its investment profits. The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund does much better here, although it was not the best fund overall over the past ten years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recent Performance Update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We last <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800500-dsl-this-popular-bond-fund-is-destroying-purchasing-power\">discussed</a> the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund on July 10, 2025. As such, approximately seven-and-a-half months have passed since the last time that we looked at this fund. As we all know, many things can happen over a seven-month period. That was certainly the case with this one, and as such, there are a few things that we should discuss to understand the performance of this fund since that time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the most important things that occurred over the past seven months that had an impact on bonds and bond prices is the resumption of the Federal Reserve’s attempts to ease monetary policy. This came in the form of three 25-basis point cuts to the federal funds target rate, which occurred in September, October, and December:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699303455665_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1654\" data-height=\"608\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699303455665_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EFFR Article-to-Article Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"235\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699303455665_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699303455665_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699303455665_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699303455665_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The effective federal funds rate was 4.33% the last time that we reviewed the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund. Today, it is at 3.64%, or 69 basis points below the July level. This is in line with the 75-basis points of cuts to the federal funds target rate, although the central bank did not manage to force the federal funds rate down by the entire 75 basis points. The current effective federal funds rate is in the target range, however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We should note that the Federal Reserve only directly controls short-term interest rates. Long-term interest rates, such as those paid by most bonds, are not under the direct control of the nation’s central bank. This is why we can sometimes get situations such as what happened at the end of 2024, when the yields on long-term bonds rose despite the Federal Reserve reducing its benchmark federal funds target rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It was a bit of a different story in the current period, however. As was just mentioned, the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark federal funds target rate by 75 basis points since July. This did not cause the interest rate on long-term bonds to rise as it did back in 2024. Rather, the coupon yields on long-term bonds declined in response to this event, although they did not decline by nearly as much as the federal funds rate did. We can see this here:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Bond Term</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Yield on July 10, 2025</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Yield Today</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Ten-Year</p></td> <td><p>4.35%</p></td> <td><p>4.02%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Twenty-Year</p></td> <td><p>4.87%</p></td> <td><p>4.60%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Thirty-Year</p></td> <td><p>4.86%</p></td> <td><p>4.67%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the purposes of this chart, I used the yield of U.S. Treasury securities of the specified term at the close of the market on the date mentioned. Corporate bond yields will be higher, but U.S. Treasuries generally give a pretty good idea of what the rest of the bond market is doing. As we can see, long-term U.S. Treasury yields have only declined by 19 to 33 basis points, depending on the term. This is far less than the decline in short-term yields that occurred over the period. As such, the yield curve has steepened.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bond funds such as the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund mostly invest in notes and bonds, rather than in ultra-short-term bills.

As such, caution may be recommended, as situations such as this could very easily result in a distribution cut if the fund’s management cannot correct this problem.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even if we take the fund’s distributions into account, the DoubleLine Income Solution Fund substantially underperformed the bond indices:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-1772169933350722_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"413\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-1772169933350722_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL vs Indices Total Return Article-to-Article Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"220\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-1772169933350722_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-1772169933350722_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-1772169933350722_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-1772169933350722_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fortunately, we do see that the fund managed to deliver a positive total return over the period. The distributions that it paid out over the period were greater than the decline in the share price. However, investors still would have been better off with any of the index funds. The emerging market bond index fund, in particular, did very well, which may have been partly due to the fact that emerging markets in general have <a href=\"https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/insights/emerging-market-debt-outlook-the-return-of-goldilocks\" rel=\"nofollow\">lower debt and less fiscal pressures</a> than developed countries. Emerging market debt (particularly emerging market debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar) did remarkably well in 2025, and we can see that reflected above. While the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund does have some exposure to emerging market debt, it was clearly unable to capitalize on the strength in that sector as illustrated by its performance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Forward Outlook For The Fund</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While perhaps not as common as in 2024, it is still fairly often that I see financial commentators <a href=\"https://global.morningstar.com/en-nd/bonds/why-2026-will-be-turning-point-bonds\" rel=\"nofollow\">suggest</a> that bonds will do fairly well as an asset class in 2026. The reasons for these calls usually revolve around predictions that the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates this year and that inflation will decline. However, these two drivers might not be as good for bonds as some analysts expect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One common suggestion in favor of bonds is that interest rates should come down as the Federal Reserve reduces interest rates. It is true that the Federal Reserve is expected to continue with its interest rate-cutting program that began back in 2024. Indeed, as of right now, the market believes that there is a 33.0% chance that there will be two 25-basis point cuts to the federal funds target rate by the end of this year:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699339966426_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1287\" data-height=\"690\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699339966426_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FED FUND Predictions YE2026\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"343\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699339966426_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699339966426_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699339966426_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699339966426_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, we can note in the chart above that the market believes that it is more likely that there will be three 25-basis point cuts than that there will be one cut by the end of the year. In fact, the market currently believes that there is a 59.3% chance that the federal funds target range will be cut by either 50 or 75 basis points by the end of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is an inverse correlation between interest rates and bond prices. Whenever interest rates decline, bond prices increase and vice versa. The argument for buying bonds, therefore, becomes that the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate cuts will reduce interest rates all across the yield curve and thus cause bond prices to rise. There are two problems with this thesis. The first is that interest rates on bonds do not always decline whenever the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. We saw this in the final three months of 2024. In fact, the yield of the ten-year U.S. Treasury note is higher today than it was on September 16, 2024. The reason that I chose that date is that it was the day before the Federal Open Market Committee met and made the decision to cut the federal funds target rate by 50 basis points (the first rate cut of the current cycle). On September 16, 2024, the ten-year U.S. Treasury note closed at 3.63%. Today, the ten-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.02%, despite the federal funds target rate being 175 basis points lower than it was in early September 2024. Thus, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve do not always lower the interest rates on bonds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second reason why the thesis about interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve is flawed is that the market is forward-looking. As we have just seen, the market currently expects the central bank to reduce the federal funds rate by 50 to 75 basis points this year. That expectation is already priced into bonds. Thus, if the Federal Reserve simply fulfills the market’s expectations, it is unlikely to move bond prices by very much. Therefore, any bond market profits that are likely to be made by 50 to 75 basis points of cuts have already been made.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other part of the thesis that some analysts are making in favor of bonds is that inflation is coming down and will continue to do so. However, it is unclear whether or not inflation is actually coming down. On February 20, 2026, the Bureau of Economic Analysis <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/news/2026/personal-income-and-outlays-december-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">released</a> its personal consumption expenditures index for the month of December 2025. This report showed that this index increased by 2.9% year-over-year. That is higher than in any of the past four months:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699345924413.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PCE Inflation Rate 4-Mo.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"537\" height=\"182\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699345924413.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699345924413.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699345924413.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bureau of Economic Analysis</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, that is the highest year-over-year increase in any of the past twelve months:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699349129305_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"983\" data-height=\"453\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699349129305_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PCE YoY Rate of Change 1-Yr.

The personal consumption expenditures index is generally considered to be a better indicator of the true rate of inflation than the Consumer Price Index. There are a few reasons for this, including the fact that the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index includes a broader range of goods and services consumed by individuals, and it also takes into account the price of things that are purchased by health insurance and similar products that make purchases on behalf of consumers. The Federal Reserve has historically considered the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index to be a more accurate measure of inflation, and it relies on it to make decisions about monetary policy rather than the Consumer Price Index.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, it is questionable whether or not inflation is actually coming down. The Consumer Price Index shows that it dropped in January, although it is still higher than in April 2025:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699355237284_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"978\" data-height=\"459\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699355237284_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"US CPI YoY Rate of Change 1-Yr.

Unless this trend changes and inflation quickly declines and stays down, then there is not much room for bond yields to decline. After all, investors still want to get a positive real return on their bonds. It is difficult to see any catalyst that could push inflation down and keep it down for an extended period of time, given the borrowing needs of the U.S. government.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, it is difficult to make a bullish case for bonds or bond funds right now. Most of the potential upside from interest rate cuts is already priced in, and bond yields cannot decline very much before they end up delivering negative real yields. As such, DSL seems somewhat unlikely to deliver much upside over the next twelve months.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Distribution Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The website for the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund states that the fund has the primary objective of providing its investors with a high level of current income. This makes a lot of sense for a bond fund. In accordance with this objective, the fund pays a monthly distribution of $0.1100 per share ($1.32 per share annually), which gives it an 11.49% yield at the current share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let us look at the fund’s most recent financial report, which is the annual report for the twelve-month period that ended on September 30, 2025, to see how well it is covering its distribution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the twelve-month period that ended on September 30, 2025, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund reported a net investment income of $118,096,979. That was not sufficient to cover the $149,393,545 that the fund paid out in distributions over the period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, the fund was not able to make up for the difference through capital gains. For the twelve-month period that ended on September 30, 2025, DSL reported net realized losses of $17,784,059, which were partially offset by $8,647,081 of net unrealized gains.

Thus, it did manage to cover its distributions over the past two years. However, we can still see that the fund had to rely on its net unrealized gains to accomplish this. That could be problematic given that bonds always pay their face value at maturity (regardless of what the fund paid to get them) and unrealized gains are not necessarily permanent. As such, investors might still want to keep a watchful eye on the fund’s finances and watch its net asset value closely.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares of the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund are currently trading at a 2.81% discount on net asset value. This is a slightly worse price than the 3.53% discount that the fund’s shares have had on average over the past month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund’s current price is, however, reasonably in line with its long-term average. Over the past five years, shares of DSL have traded at prices ranging from a 14.20% discount to a 3.00% premium on net asset value. The average price over the five-year period was a 2.07% discount on net asset value. That is a slightly worse price than the fund has today.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Fund Name</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Premium/(Discount)</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund</p></td> <td><p>(2.81%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>BrandywineGLOBAL – Global Income Opportunities Fund</p></td> <td><p>(8.57%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>MFS Multimarket Income Trust</p></td> <td><p>(16.07%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Nuveen Global High Income Fund</p></td> <td><p>(7.83%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>PIMCO Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund</p></td> <td><p>5.76%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Putnam Premier Income Trust</p></td> <td><p>(3.97%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Western Asset Global Corporate Defined Opportunity Fund</p></td> <td><p>(5.32%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>abrdn Global Income Fund</p></td> <td><p>12.41%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The median price out of this group of eight funds is a 4.65% discount, so we can see that the current price of DSL is a bit above the peer median level. However, given that this is historically one of the more expensive bond funds around and that it is not particularly expensive compared to its long-term average price, the current price appears reasonable.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expenses</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund’s annual report states that it had an expense ratio of 2.98% for the most recent fiscal year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In conclusion, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund is a closed-end bond fund that provides a far superior yield than that of most bond index funds. It is difficult to make a case for buying it though, given that the fund failed to cover its distribution in the most recent year and it has been suffering from falling net asset value. Furthermore, it is difficult to make a case for buying bonds in the current environment, given that interest rate cuts are already priced in, and inflation remains high enough to limit the degree to which interest rates can decline further before real rates become negative. The fund’s price appears to be reasonable compared to its historical range, however.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

Are You Serious?</h2> <p>Wow! Before I begin to discuss the thesis for investors in Block, Inc. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XYZ\" title=\"Block, Inc.\">XYZ</a></span>), I would like to express my heartfelt sympathies to the Block employees who<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> are affected by this sweeping 40% single-day </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558343-blocks-jack-dorsey-tells-employees-why-hes-slashing-headcount-and-what-block-is-paying\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">headcount reduction</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> that CEO Jack Dorsey has decided to initiate.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There were already reported rumors of some kind of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4548789-block-may-eliminate-up-to-10-positions\">reorganization back in early February</a>. But that reported figure was supposed to be 10%, not the 40% that we have come to know as of yesterday (February 26). So it must have baffled Block employees and investors, even though the market has reacted with palpable optimism.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm not going to go into whether the market is right or wrong to lift XYZ stock by almost 20% in the pre-market as I pen this update. It is my understanding that markets are amoral and that they react to KPIs (most of the time). And because of the potential of a markedly lower cost base due to the significant reduction in headcount, not only has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875898-block-inc-xyz-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">guidance for XYZ improved</a> in the near term, but the upgrade is also pretty significant. With that, I think you can make sense of why the market reacted like what we saw after the earnings report and conference. CFO Amrita Ahuja has the insights for us:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>For Q1, we expect year-over-year gross profit growth of 22% to $2.8 billion. In addition to the growth momentum we're seeing, our guidance also reflects a smaller cost structure going forward. We believe the actions we're taking today will enable us to deliver faster product innovation for customers in the future while also enabling us to invest meaningfully in our business. With this change in cost structure, combined with the investments we plan to make, we are increasing our guidance for adjusted operating income in 2026 to $3.2 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 54% and 6 points of margin expansion relative to 2025. We are increasing our expectation for adjusted diluted EPS in 2026 to $3.66, also reflecting year-over-year growth of 54%. For Q1, we expect adjusted operating income of $600 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.67, reflecting year-over-year growth of 29% and 20%, respectively. Before wrapping up, a few additional considerations related to our guidance. Our Q1 operating income guidance includes a modest benefit from today's announcement, but we expect the organizational changes we announced today to begin to more meaningfully impact adjusted operating income in the second quarter with the full impact of our new cost structure more meaningfully improving profitability in the second half of the year. Given these timing dynamics and the pacing of investments in both risk loss and sales and marketing, we expect adjusted operating income margins to expand each quarter throughout the year from our Q1 starting point of 21%. We expect these margins to expand at a faster rate in Q3 and Q4 relative to Q2, and we expect to deliver just under 60% of our 2026 adjusted operating income guidance in the second half of the year. - <em>Block Q4 2025 earnings call.</em></p></blockquote> <p data-start=\"1137\" data-end=\"1800\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">There you go. It is not a little bit of an increase, right? We are talking about a 54% growth in adjusted EPS for 2026 and also a 54% growth in adjusted operating income, or AOI, for the same fiscal year. Note that most of the benefits will flow through to the P&amp;L in the second quarter and second half, as year-over-year growth guidance for Q1 is limited to about 20% on adjusted EPS. Hence, the market is reacting just like what we should expect the market to do. It does suggest that Block has finally moved from AI experimentation to productization successfully; otherwise, we wouldn't see it being reflected and emphasized as such by the CFO in the outlook commentary.</p> <p data-start=\"1802\" data-end=\"3330\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">And we wouldn't see that <a href=\"https://s29.q4cdn.com/628966176/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-2025-Shareholder-Letter_Block.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">Block CEO Jack Dorsey is so confident</a> that he has decided to take it upon himself to announce these far-reaching layoffs to his organization. Now you see, Jack Dorsey has always been somewhat of an engineering person, if you are familiar with his background. While he may not necessarily be the <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/newsletters/the-briefing/jack-dorsey-proves-ai-job-cut-fears-true-ellisons-win-warner?rc=3e6wgn\" rel=\"nofollow\">best manager of talent</a>, some could argue he has still been instrumental and influential in shaping narratives involving social media (he’s the co-founder of Twitter), Bitcoin (note that XYZ owns a reporting segment linked to it), and, of course, payments infrastructure.</p> <h2 data-start=\"1802\" data-end=\"3330\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Block's Two-Sided Flywheel Will Be Tested</h2> <p data-start=\"1802\" data-end=\"3330\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the latter, Block has penetrated firmly into the Gen Z consumer segment and also the SMB merchant opportunities. In other words, Block has consolidated a two-sided flywheel encompassing Cash App (consumer) and Square (merchant) in its fledgling ecosystem. Investors who have followed this company long enough before it changed its name to Block and ticker symbol to XYZ should know that back in the pandemic boom years, they also acquired Afterpay. And we all know that back then, tech companies were going after talent like nobody's business, snapping up everyone like \"hotcakes,\" as bosses were concerned whether they could hire enough people due to the implication resulting from the pandemic.</p> <p data-start=\"1802\" data-end=\"3330\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Obviously, those crazy moments are now well behind us. Employment indicators have gone tepid, even though they are not showing any distress signals right now. However, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-24/us-consumer-confidence-rises-on-stronger-views-of-economy-jobs?srnd=homepage-americas\" rel=\"nofollow\">consumer confidence</a> is still at historically low levels, despite having some respite this month based on the latest reports.</p> <p data-start=\"3332\" data-end=\"3782\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, I think there is some justification that Block could have amalgamated a pretty sizeable headcount base that may not truly reflect the current era where AI could fundamentally alter the growth curve of its earnings projections. Let's not forget that the market has not been truly convinced about its investor day goals yet. Because if the market has full confidence in those targets, then why is XYZ still &gt;80% below its pandemic-era highs when calculated from its recent bottom?</p> <p data-start=\"3784\" data-end=\"4265\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course we could point out that this situation is not unique to Block. In the fintech space, we have seen how PayPal (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PYPL\" title=\"PayPal Holdings, Inc.\">PYPL</a>) has also suffered immensely at the hands of the shareholder class. PayPal also owns a two-sided network, but it probably hasn’t executed as well as XYZ in the merchant space. I guess that's why, when it comes to e-commerce, it has not been able to make significant gains and is underperforming the market average, as <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874612-paypal-left-for-dead-but-the-buyout-narrative-changes-everything-upgrade\">I discussed in a recent PYPL update</a>.</p> <p data-start=\"4267\" data-end=\"4603\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Whereas, for Block, the current environment offers them another chance to regain the initiative and help the stock get out of its rut. The market needs more confidence, obviously beyond just headcount cuts. Nevertheless, the upgraded guidance for 2026, for now, shows that the company has a viable pathway to reaching its 2028 commitments.</p> <p data-start=\"4605\" data-end=\"4855\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">In July last year, in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802172-block-rally-not-finished-yet-do-not-bail-now\">my previous update on Block</a>, I thought that the slide in the stock could come to an end. However, this proved to be premature, as the challenges that have affected fintech companies like Block persisted through the rest of 2025.</p> <h2 data-start=\"4605\" data-end=\"4855\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Block: Growth Reacceleration In The Works</h2> <p data-start=\"4605\" data-end=\"4855\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721920203746235.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Block 2025 gross profit\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"Block 2025 gross profit\" data-source=\"Block\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721920203746235.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721920203746235.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721920203746235.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721920203746235.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\">Block 2025 gross profit <span>(Block)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p data-start=\"4605\" data-end=\"4855\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p data-start=\"4857\" data-end=\"5833\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the positive takeaway from the 2025 numbers is that the company is still fundamentally strong. It's already profitable, and it has integrated its diverse segments well, benefiting from the two-sided flywheel that I discussed earlier. This network effect has obviously gained traction even though the growth rates have slowed tremendously.</p> <p data-start=\"4857\" data-end=\"5833\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we can see from the above chart, Block is now no longer considered a high-growth play. There are enough profitable companies out there outside the fintech space that are growing their profits above 20%. You can find them easily in the semiconductor space or even among the suppliers to the chip designers, as they supply the picks and shovels and the plumbing to help build out the AI infrastructure. And since we are still in the earlier stages of this multi-trillion-dollar phase, I believe management could also be concerned about when they will get that re-rating opportunity that could see the valuation return to a higher level.</p> <p data-start=\"5835\" data-end=\"6504\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because it's important for us to understand that fintech companies are not your typical value or income stock in the financial sector. Value investors are not going to pay the current premium (17x forward earnings, as compared to financial media of &lt;11x) attached to XYZ even before yesterday's post-earnings spike. These investors should very much prefer more stable big banking earnings predictability, as well as the dividend income that comes with their P&amp;L, that are less susceptible to business cycle risks that could affect XYZ more significantly than the rest. After all, like I mentioned earlier, the company has a bigger exposure to the more vulnerable class in the consumer and merchant business.</p> <p data-start=\"5835\" data-end=\"6504\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-1772192171880085.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Block guidance\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"Block guidance\" data-source=\"Block\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-1772192171880085.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-1772192171880085.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-1772192171880085.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-1772192171880085.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\">Block guidance <span>(Block)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p data-start=\"5835\" data-end=\"6504\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p data-start=\"6506\" data-end=\"7032\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, I believe management must come out with something disruptive on their own to re-energize shareholders and potential growth investors to come back to its bullish narrative. And if you can put up guidance that suggests more than 50% growth in adjusted earnings, now that's something to get people’s attention, right? It certainly also got my attention, because if you look at the 2026 guidance, it suggests that gross profit growth could now be re-accelerating and laying a clearer pathway to reaching the 2028 imperatives.</p> <p data-start=\"7034\" data-end=\"7452\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's important right now is that management has a lower OpEx base to work with, even though this is predicated very much on the success of its AI initiatives. It remains to be seen whether these are indeed transformational for the company, but I guess Block is astutely leveraging the zeitgeist that has made Claude Code the dominant media narrative and headlines in the past month, and particularly so this week.</p> <p data-start=\"7454\" data-end=\"7750\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">For a stock that was valued at just under 17x forward earnings before the run-up, it is very below the S&amp;P 500’s 21.4x forward earnings. In other words, there is much for XYZ to be re-rated if it manages to use the current organizational restructuring to drive constructive earnings growth.</p> <p data-start=\"7752\" data-end=\"8160\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jack Dorsey was clearly generous with his words, as he wanted to use the opportunity to emphasize how deeply the company has integrated AI into its workflows, suggesting that this project has been an ongoing and multi-year initiative. So the 40% headcount reduction should not be construed as something it came up with at the last minute, given the current flux that we have in fintech on the street right now.</p> <p data-start=\"8162\" data-end=\"9316\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dorsey’s commentary suggests to me that we could see an even tighter integration on its network and peer-to-peer capabilities. Therefore, it is not only going to be just the merchant side, but also the consumer side. This should drive improved operating leverage. As he explained, Block could \"personalize\" the products and services, which has the potential to improve the attach rates on its software integration, which is actually where Block really makes most of its money.</p> <p data-start=\"8162\" data-end=\"9316\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">And so they have this dual-pronged approach in circulating the consumer and merchant flywheel to deliver a higher value proposition through a \"better understanding of Block’s customers.\" I think the traction is really still very much uncertain in the current context. So I expect management to provide us more salient updates on how these AI initiatives could propel it closer to its 2028 goals. While investors have bid up the stock in view of the optimistic outlook, moving forward they will definitely want to see execution and clarity from the AI productization to be convinced that a longer time recovery could be taken as the norm and not the exception.</p> <h2 data-start=\"8162\" data-end=\"9316\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Buy Or Sell XYZ Stock?</h2> <p data-start=\"8162\" data-end=\"9316\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721923701022832.png?io=w640\" alt=\"XYZ price chart (long-term, monthly)\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"XYZ price chart (long-term, monthly)\" data-source=\"TradingView\" width=\"640\" height=\"418\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721923701022832.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721923701022832.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721923701022832.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721923701022832.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\">XYZ price chart (long-term, monthly) <span>(TradingView)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p data-start=\"8162\" data-end=\"9316\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p data-start=\"9318\" data-end=\"10640\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Okay, I guess you can see that XYZ has been moving in a pretty predictable consolidation zone between the $45 level and the $80 level. With the pre-market prices moving the stock back up to the $65 zone, the situation has arguably stabilized, which should reduce the chances of seeing it fall back toward the February lows.</p> <p data-start=\"9318\" data-end=\"10640\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">And since the $45 level has almost been tested twice, I don't expect the stock to drop below that level. Yet I also don't find enough longer-term catalysts after this current surge as the market attempts to price in the near-term benefits from a lower cost base, attributed to the organizational restructuring.</p> <p data-start=\"9318\" data-end=\"10640\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving from here, investors will likely press management for more answers on how it intends to execute such a massive reduction in its employee count. Without that level of certainty, it's challenging to envisage how Block could attract more buyers back as the valuation normalizes closer to the S&amp;P 500 average.</p> <p data-start=\"9318\" data-end=\"10640\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, the ongoing economic uncertainties and weak consumer confidence levels could continue to weigh on its buying sentiments through the rest of 2026. And with the broad weakness in the financial sector potentially stymying efforts in elevating the bullish proposition, the coast is far from clear. This should require us to consider a larger discount to reflect these headwinds.</p> <p data-start=\"10642\" data-end=\"10669\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rating: Downgrade XYZ to Hold.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

This isn't the case with Iridium Communications (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IRDM\" title=\"Iridium Communications Inc.\">IRDM</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">); the firm has solid fundamentals with management that has a propensity to return value to shareholders; however, the stock has been a laggard for multiple years now, which made me label it a \"falling knife\" in my previous </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824611-iridium-communications-good-fundamentals-but-a-fall-knife-nonetheless\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">article</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">. To give you a perspective of how disappointing the price performance has been, just take a look at the YoY performance chart of IRDM vs. peers and the S&amp;P 500. Iridium lost 22% in value, underperforming the 18% return from SPY, while ViaSat, Globalstar, and EchoStar returned 449.7%, 224.2%, and 277.6%, respectively. </span></p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721253498596656.png?io=w640\" alt=\"YoY Total returns\" width=\"629\" height=\"500\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"629\" data-height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721253498596656.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721253498596656.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721253498596656.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">YoY Total returns <span>(YCharts)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason for this major underperformance has to do with the fact that the company has historically underinvested in growth while its industry was being invaded by multiple competitors like SpaceX and AST SpaceMobile. This made investors question the durability of Iridium's dominance in offering IoT and narrowband services to government and enterprises. Investor behavior was slightly different in the last 10 years compared to the current environment. Companies that were being too conservative with their use of cash were seen as ossified and had a greater chance of being disrupted by companies that were embarking on more ambitious goals. Since 2017, IRDM has reduced its CAPEX by roughly 80%, while competitors were going in the other direction.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336971165698_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336971165698_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IRDM CAPEX vs Peers\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336971165698_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336971165698_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336971165698_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336971165698_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IRDM CAPEX vs Peers <span>(Stock Analysis)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, relative to peers, Iridium has been growing its top line at single digits, which in a way was validating to the market that the firm must have been slowly losing its pricing power in certain segments of its business, especially the broadband segment, which has been declining since 2023 as enterprises switched to using Starlink's constellation to access higher throughput and low-latency Ka and Ku bands and opted for Iridium's broadband services as backup. While growth rates are highly cyclical in this industry, IRDM hasn't been able to achieve YoY rates of more than 20%, while VSAT and GSAT would return more than 50% in a given year. In the last five years, Iridium returned a revenue CAGR of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/comparison/new/MCUyQ2lyZG0lMkNhc3RzJTJDc2F0cyUyQ2dzYXQlMkN2c2F0\">8%</a> vs. its peers ASTS, SATS, GSAT, and VSAT returning 36.39%, 51.56%, 15.58%, and 15.44%, respectively. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336734901357_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336734901357_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IRDM revenue growth vs Peers\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336734901357_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336734901357_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336734901357_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336734901357_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IRDM revenue growth vs Peers <span>(Stock Analysis)</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result of the stock continuing to decline, Iridium now trades at an attractive valuation relative to its sector and peers. But when the stock first showed up on my screens, I was wary to hit the bid, as momentum indicators were still in the red. Hence my initial hold rating. The momentum is finally positive, and there are growth drivers like the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869525-iridium-communications-inc-irdm-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">commercialization</a> of NTN Direct and PNT ASICs in the middle of this year that are expected to boost topline growth by $200 million in 2030. However, the short-term catalyst for significant growth will likely come from third-party enterprises that are looking to utilize Iridium's L-band spectrum asset to offer a D2D network to its end consumers, but this is still in the speculation phase, but the likelihood of such an alliance is pretty high given that management did state in the last earnings call that it will not rule out business alliances that offer incremental value to shareholders. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721264796875544.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q4 Earnings transcripts\" width=\"567\" height=\"263\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"567\" data-height=\"263\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721264796875544.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721264796875544.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721264796875544.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Q4 Earnings transcripts <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my previous article, I said Iridium had solid fundamentals, but it's a falling knife. Due to recent events, this sentiment has shifted. YTD, Iridium stock has outperformed its peers, returning 36%, while GSAT and SATS returned 3% and -1%, respectively. The scatter plot below makes a comparison between 1-year and YTD performance of a subset of stocks within the communication services sector that are close peers to Iridium. Iridium is in the second quadrant with one of the highest YTD performances, showing a mean-reversion behavior. This is also true with GSAT and SATS; they've massively outperformed peers last year, but YTD performance has disappointed. Given the B+ rating for momentum, I expect this positive momentum to continue, driven by Iridium's discounted valuation and the commercialization of NTN and PNT services, making me upgrade my initial rating from a hold to a strong buy. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721258345130308_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1276\" data-height=\"506\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721258345130308_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Momentum\" width=\"640\" height=\"254\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"254\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721258345130308_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721258345130308_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721258345130308_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721258345130308_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Momentum <span>(Analyst Chart, Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial Analysis</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FY 2025 Income Statement</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the full <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/154067302\">fiscal year</a> results, revenue increased 5% to $871.55 million. Looking at segments, the growth was led by engineering and support growing 26% to $156.96 million, followed by commercial IoT increasing 9% to $181.38 million. Growth was offset by subscriber equipment declining 11% to $81.11 million and broadband declining 10% to $50.72 million.

The growth in FCF was offset by capex increasing 43% to $100.28 million. This massive capex growth is in response to the company pausing buybacks to bolster growth through additional services. Management did state that it is not under pressure to invest in upgrading and growing its LEO constellation until 2031, freeing FCF for more dividend payouts and debt reduction. Despite FCF growing 2%, the margin still outpaced the sector median at 28% vs. 10.33%. SBC decreased 19% to $51.58 million, reflecting management's commitment to reducing stock dilution, as it stated that future compensation will be paid fully in cash, reducing stock issuance by 1%. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721267581231148_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6000\" data-height=\"4000\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721267581231148_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FY2025 Cash Flow Statement\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"427\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721267581231148_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721267581231148_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721267581231148_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721267581231148_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">FY2025 Cash Flow Statement <span>(Analyst chart, SEC Filling)</span></p></figcaption></figure><h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FY 2025 Balance Sheet</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Iridium's balance sheet displays management's effort to reduce debt and lower interest expenses.

While the balance sheet is still highly leveraged, the firm managed to retire debt that was maturing in the near term; most of the remaining debt matures in 2030, and given that the firm is a cash-generating machine with growth drivers ahead, I'm pretty confident the debt-to-equity ratio will get reduced to 2x as management intends. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126803122895_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6000\" data-height=\"4000\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126803122895_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FY2025 Balance Sheet\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"427\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126803122895_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126803122895_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126803122895_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126803122895_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">FY2025 Balance Sheet <span>(Analyst chart, SEC Filling)</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Quantitative Analysis</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the profitability factor of Iridium in relation to its peers, we can see that it has one of the highest EBITDA and FCF margins, warranting it an A- rating by the Seeking Alpha Quant system.

The trend line in the scatter plot illustrates that for a firm that trades at a price-to-cash flow of 6.20x, the fair value for the EBITDA multiple should be around 13x as opposed to the current multiple of 9.36x, implying a 39% stock upside. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126942925048_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1276\" data-height=\"506\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126942925048_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"254\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"254\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126942925048_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126942925048_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126942925048_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126942925048_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Valuation <span>(Analyst chart, Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, when we look at the median of its historical valuation, it sits at 16.69x.

The reason for this estimation has to do with the surging demand for surveillance services that will enable governments to track position, time, and locations of war assets like UAVs without jamming and spoofing risks, unlike with GPS. As we speak, PNT services are being used in Europe and Asia, and management stated they have realized well over $10 million in revenue and estimate realizing more than $100 million by 2030 during the Q&amp;A of the call. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are multiple execution risks associated with Iridium, the main one being that they are expected to commercialize NTN direct in the middle of this year while also expected to transition the PNT ASIC from the prototype to the commercial phase. Any faults or delays in any of these developments could result in the stock tanking, as this will reduce investors' confidence in topline growth. And also, given the fact that management has paused buyback, the cushion layer for drawdowns has been removed, leaving no protection for the downside risk. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My worries about Iridium have been lowered given the positive momentum that has built up since the start of this year. I have always been impressed by the fundamentals of the firm and management's commitment to return value to shareholders, but seeing that the stock had consistently dropped made me feel wary that we could be catching a falling knife. That is not the case anymore. The firm now has growth drivers that will definitely appeal to investors that over-index for topline growth, adding another class of investors on top of those looking for high profitability and shareholder yield. According to my model, we could see roughly 39% upside if Iridium were to trade in line with its sector on an EBITDA multiple, deserving of a strong buy rating. </p>",

Sticky inflation data and a steady, low jobless rate may complicate that forecast for a near-term cut. Markets will pay close attention to next week’s payrolls report for February, looking for new clues on where monetary policy is headed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another key variable is Kevin Warsh, the incoming Fed chair, who will take over the central bank’s leadership in May. Analysts are debating whether Warsh will tilt dovish to support President Trump’s demands for lower interest rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A complicating factor is the current nowcast for a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4873893-us-growth-slows-q4-early-q1-data-signals-rebound\" rel=\"noopener\">rebound</a> in economic growth for the first quarter. The Atlanta Fed’s <a href=\"https://www.atlantafed.org/research-and-data/data/gdpnow\" rel=\"nofollow\">GDPNow model</a>, for example, is currently estimating that GDP will rise 3.1% in the first three months of this year, up sharply from Q4’s sluggish 1.4% increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The rise of artificial intelligence as an economic input is another variable that’s muddling the outlook. “The question is how is AI going to be inflationary, and maybe the long end of the curve is sniffing all of this out,” <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bond-traders-betting-fed-rate-111333432.html\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management. “The only inflationary aspect of AI is the building out of data centers and the associated energy needs, and that is known.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If CEOs are right and growth is re-accelerating, the Treasury market is mispriced. If the bond market is right, CEO optimism is a head fake.

This ongoing regulatory uncertainty serves as a systemic drag on the market, outweighing other potential technical or on-chain improvements.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Key Crypto-Specific Catalysts </strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amid this macro turmoil, project-specific events have exacerbated the downdraft:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Vitalik Buterin did sell 1,869 ETH for about $3.67 million over two days in late February 2026. This formed part of a larger pre-announced plan from late January, when he withdrew and allocated 16,384 ETH to support long-term Ethereum ecosystem initiatives. Although these sales were strategic and transparent, they added short-term market pressure and contributed to roughly a 5% decline in ETH's price during an already fragile period. This shows how extremely sensitive and fearful the current crypto market has become: reactions to the capital flows of key figures or institutions are often excessively amplified, gradually eroding rational market behavior in this environment.</p></li> <li><p>Bitdeer, a leading Bitcoin mining company, fully liquidated its self-mined Bitcoin treasury, selling approximately 1,133 BTC for about $62 million, reducing its holdings to zero. The move aims to generate liquidity for AI cloud services expansion and data center land acquisitions. Similarly, in early Feb 2026, Cango miner sold 4,451 BTC for roughly $305 million to bolster its balance sheet and accelerate its pivot to AI infrastructure. More and more miners are shifting toward AI and data center infrastructure, using Bitcoin sales as a key financing strategy to fuel this pivot.</p></li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Did the 10am Dump Stop Bitcoin from Hitting $150K?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since late 2024, Bitcoin has consistently experienced sharp sell-offs every trading day right around 10 a.m. Eastern Time, a pattern dubbed the “10am dump” by the crypto community.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a viral long-form X post, Justin Bechler argues that this was executed by quantitative trading firm Jane Street. As an Authorized Participant for major Bitcoin spot ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBIT\" title=\"iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF\">IBIT</a>), Jane Street has privileged access to create and redeem ETF shares directly with real Bitcoin. This allows them to arbitrage discrepancies between the ETF’s NAV and the spot market price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The author claims Jane Street leveraged this position by programmatically selling Bitcoin into the open market at 10 a.m., deliberately pushing spot prices lower to accumulate ETF shares at a discount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_202602270322347a4ddd32-6410-42f7-bf74-1728cebf6df9.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1500\" data-height=\"646\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_202602270322347a4ddd32-6410-42f7-bf74-1728cebf6df9.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Whale's Insight: Surface Weakness Masks Whale Accumulation In ETH\" width=\"1280\" height=\"551\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_202602270322347a4ddd32-6410-42f7-bf74-1728cebf6df9.jpg?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_202602270322347a4ddd32-6410-42f7-bf74-1728cebf6df9.jpg?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_202602270322347a4ddd32-6410-42f7-bf74-1728cebf6df9.jpg?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_202602270322347a4ddd32-6410-42f7-bf74-1728cebf6df9.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_202602270322347a4ddd32-6410-42f7-bf74-1728cebf6df9.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_202602270322347a4ddd32-6410-42f7-bf74-1728cebf6df9.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_202602270322347a4ddd32-6410-42f7-bf74-1728cebf6df9.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The post points to Jane Street’s Q4 2025 13F filings showing $790 million in IBIT holdings but suggests these long positions were likely fully hedged or even net short via undisclosed derivatives like put options, short futures, or collar strategies. This masked any true bearish exposure while public disclosures showed bullish holdings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The author estimates that without this daily suppression, Bitcoin’s price would already be at least $150k, far above current levels, highlighting how ETF mechanics may distort the asset’s true scarcity-driven value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notably, following a February 2026 federal lawsuit from Terraform Labs’ bankruptcy administrator accusing Jane Street of insider trading (tied to the 2022 Terra collapse), the 10am dump pattern abruptly ceased. Bitcoin then staged a strong V-shaped rebound, with the community interpreting this as legal and regulatory pressure forcing Jane Street to halt the alleged algorithm.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_20260227032235791c9113-036d-49c7-bd4c-4bd8b99126f0.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1500\" data-height=\"1510\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_20260227032235791c9113-036d-49c7-bd4c-4bd8b99126f0.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Whale's Insight: Surface Weakness Masks Whale Accumulation In ETH\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1289\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_20260227032235791c9113-036d-49c7-bd4c-4bd8b99126f0.jpg?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_20260227032235791c9113-036d-49c7-bd4c-4bd8b99126f0.jpg?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_20260227032235791c9113-036d-49c7-bd4c-4bd8b99126f0.jpg?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_20260227032235791c9113-036d-49c7-bd4c-4bd8b99126f0.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_20260227032235791c9113-036d-49c7-bd4c-4bd8b99126f0.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_20260227032235791c9113-036d-49c7-bd4c-4bd8b99126f0.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_20260227032235791c9113-036d-49c7-bd4c-4bd8b99126f0.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The thread exploded in popularity, sparking heated debates in crypto circles about institutional arbitrage transparency, ETF structural flaws, and Bitcoin’s suppressed price potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While some analysts counter that the pattern wasn’t consistent enough to prove systemic manipulation, and others point out that large market makers such as Jane Street have long possessed the technical ability to influence prices across many assets, though intentional manipulation is clearly illegal and not unique to crypto, the narrative has reignited scrutiny over who truly controls Bitcoin’s price discovery.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Week Ahead </strong></h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p><strong>Mar 1 </strong>Crypto Expo Europe</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mar 3</strong> US ISM Manufacturing PMI Release</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mar 5 </strong>Employment Situation for February</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mar 5 </strong>U.S. Import and Export Price Indexes for January</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next week blends crypto community activity with key US macro data.

I found that despite its recent missteps, the stock was still trading at a discount. The misstep I am referring<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to was the acquisition of Indoff in May 2023, which was dilutive in terms of operating margins and shifted the company's focus away from expanding its lucrative Private Label portfolio.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since then, GIC has continued to grow its topline better than expected, and more significantly, has expanded its gross margins. While the SD&amp;A increase has been a drag, the YOY improvement in operating margins is a pleasant surprise. While the share price has gained 21% since, I still find GIC to be decently undervalued, both on an intrinsic basis and relative to its peers. For the stock to realize its potential, the management needs to continue this momentum on the top line, keep up the expanded gross margin profile, and successfully navigate the ever-changing tariff situation. If it can successfully accomplish this, the stock still has a good runway ahead of it - getting back to, and hopefully surpassing this time, its all-time high of around <strong>$45</strong>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Investment Thesis</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global Industrial has cultivated a broad customer base over its 75-year history, ranging from small and medium-sized businesses to large enterprises like Walmart and Home Depot. Furthermore, the company has expanded its reach into the B2C segment through digital marketing efforts and continues to broaden its product portfolio and target customer segments, with recent inroads into public sector enterprises. Now, with a new CEO in place, it is re-targeting the larger strategic enterprise and governmental accounts—which tend to be more relationship-based, with higher average order size, and result in repeat customer orders. Being able to grow revenues at 4.8% in 2025 despite a 1% shrink in Q1 and in a year plagued with tariff vagaries is quite an achievement. The company seems to have begun a positive momentum streak, with 14% topline QoQ growth in Q4 and a 100 bps gross margin improvement YOY. This has translated into almost a 100 bps improvement in its operating margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the flip side, the Selling, Distribution &amp; Administrative (SD&amp;A) expenses remain elevated, even more than 2 years after the Indoff acquisition. Given the strategic shift towards “high touch” sales, I reckon the SD&amp;A will continue to be elevated, and therefore, operating margins will stabilize around 7.1%. It is important to note that GIC has managed to improve operating margins to 9% by 2022 from 5.8% in 2017.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Against this backdrop, I ran a <strong><em>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation </em></strong>analysis for GIC. I assumed next year’s topline growth will be a tad lower at 3%, given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty, and will gradually improve to the risk-free rate of 4%. Operating margins are assumed to increase over the period from 6.5% to 7.1%, driven by gross margin improvements. Historically, the company has not needed to invest much in Capex besides maintenance capital and additional working capital needs. I reckon this modus operandi will continue. Finally, the WACC for the company is 8.6%, which is lower than what I used previously, primarily driven by the recent drop in the US risk-free rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>Using these inputs, the model yields an equity value of approximately $47/share. </em></strong>This represents a substantial 40% upside from the current share price of approximately $33.5.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>FCFF Valuation Model ($ million)</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58164074-17721487331540394_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"822\" data-height=\"437\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58164074-17721487331540394_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DCF Valuation Model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58164074-17721487331540394_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58164074-17721487331540394_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58164074-17721487331540394_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58164074-17721487331540394_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's analysis</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Simulation Results</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Results from the DCF model are highly dependent on the key assumptions outlined.

I regressed commonly used multiples against fundamental value drivers for each multiple. Based on these regression models, I calculated the predicted values of the multiples at which GIC should be trading, given its fundamentals (growth rate, margins, beta, payout ratio, ROC, etc.). I selected multiples where the regression R-squared was relatively high. As shown in the table below, GIC is currently undervalued across all four selected multiples. The valuation range derived from these relative multiples is <strong>$35 - $51</strong>. This confluence of intrinsic and relative valuation provides additional confidence in the thesis that GIC is currently trading at a discount. It should be trading close to its all-time high of around <strong>$45</strong>, which it has hit several times but has failed to break through that ceiling.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p>Multiple</p></td> <td><p>Predicted Value of Multiple</p></td> <td><p>Equity Price/ share</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>EV/Sales NTM</p></td> <td><p>1.4</p></td> <td><p><strong>$43.8</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>EV/Invested capital</p></td> <td><p>4.7</p></td> <td><p><strong>$38.1</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>EV/EBITDA NTM</p></td> <td><p>15.2</p></td> <td><p><strong>$35.1</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>P/BV</p></td> <td><p>6.24</p></td> <td><p><strong>$50.6</strong></p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Several important risk factors warrant consideration:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Continued tariff uncertainties—The tariff</strong> situation continues to evolve on an almost weekly basis. With the recent cancellation of IEEPA tariffs came the imposition of 15% tariffs under section 122. These can technically be applied for only 150 days. Hence, in another few months, we are likely to see the scenario changing again. A more significant impact from tariffs, both monetarily and due to increased uncertainty, could severely affect economic activity in North America. The industrial distribution sector would consequently suffer from reduced demand, higher landed costs of products, and increased inventory carrying costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Stalling of Private Label product proliferation—It</strong> is ironic that, though proliferation of private label portfolios is a major driver of gross margin expansion for the company, the initiative seems to have taken a back seat. The very fact that it’s not being mentioned in the prepared remarks or even in the analyst questions during the last few earnings calls is a concern. This is a unique opportunity for the company, and squandering it is not in the inventors’ best interests.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Continued poor performance of Indoff acquisition—For</strong> two years in a row, the SD&amp;A costs have increased and are now running at 28.5% of sales versus a 5-year average of 26.9% prior to the Indoff acquisition. While this may not seem like much, given the low-margin nature of the business, the impact from these 160 bps of underperformance is about 21% in intrinsic value. Even if the company can recover to the 27.5% level in the next 5 years, it would be an accretive ~$4.8 to its value.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I continue to find GIC to be trading at a substantial discount from both an intrinsic value and a relative pricing perspective. It represents a 40% upside potential from its current price of $33.5. GIC has recently (Q4 2025) repurchased 326,000 shares at an average price of $28.50, further strengthening the undervaluation thesis. It has continued on this path in Q1 2026 as well and has authorization to purchase another 1MM shares. With the current momentum from Q4 continuing, the stock has the potential to hit the $45 level again, a feat it has achieved on several occasions. There could still be further upside if management can address some of the risks outlined here.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUT\" title=\"Hut 8 Corp.\">HUT</a></span>) is being valued as if its transformation into a digital infrastructure platform is already complete. It isn't. The company has made genuine progress. It has signed contracts, developed a credible energy pipeline, and achieved<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> compute revenue that more than doubled in fiscal 2025. The stock, however, trades at roughly three times the forward EV/EBITDA multiple of its large-cap mining peers, implying that structural diversification has already shown up in earnings.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Revenue Picture</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hut 8 posted 45% year-over-year revenue growth in <a href=\"https://cdn.kscope.io/844aaf72301af0202a524be04aa938b8.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">fiscal 2025</a>, with total revenue reaching $235.1 million. That puts it in the middle of the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUT/peers/comparison\">large-cap mining peer group</a>. According to Seeking Alpha figures, Riot Platforms, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RIOT\" title=\"Riot Platforms, Inc.\">RIOT</a>) posted 103.6% over the same period. MARA Holdings, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MARA\" title=\"MARA Holdings, Inc.\">MARA</a>) came in at 53.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That would be unremarkable if forward profitability was above peers, but Hut 8 is expected to post approximately -14% forward EBITDA growth. Riot stands at 11.7%, and Marathon is at 15.6%. Mid-tier revenue growth and negative forward EBITDA growth at a premium multiple are the main issues here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valued For Future Income</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The valuation gap between Hut 8 and its peers is substantial. The stock trades at 24.7x trailing sales versus 8.9x for Riot and 3.2x for Marathon, and at 31.5x forward EV/EBITDA, roughly three times both peers. Even on a forward EV/sales basis, Hut 8 sits at 16.5x compared with 10.5x for Riot and 6.3x for Marathon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Those multiples price in infrastructure earnings that have yet to contribute significantly to the income statement. With negative forward EBITDA growth, the burden of proof rests on execution rather than current financial performance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What The Income Statement Actually Shows</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The headline numbers for fiscal 2025 aren’t great, with a net loss of $248 million and an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $135.4 million, compared to net income of $331.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $555.7 million in 2024. However, the swing was driven largely by a $220 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on Bitcoin holdings, reversing a $509.3 million gain the prior year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strip out the mark-to-market change, and the picture is considerably less bleak. Gross margin expanded from 47% to 54%. Q4 2025 revenues grew 179% year-over-year with gross margin expanding from 36% to 60%. The underlying operational trajectory is improving. The reported bottom line simply doesn't reflect it clearly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That is precisely the problem for anyone trying to support the valuation. As long as Hut 8 holds a significant Bitcoin treasury and mining remains the dominant earnings driver, reported EBITDA will continue to move with the Bitcoin price rather than with operational progress.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Computing Up, Power Down</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The segment mix in 2025 is showing signs of transition. Compute revenue more than doubled to $202.3 million from $80.7 million, driven by ASIC colocation and the Highrise AI GPU cloud business. Compute now accounts for most of the total revenue. Power revenue, meanwhile, declined to $23.2 million from $56.6 million, reflecting the termination of the Ionic Digital managed services agreement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The compute growth is solid. But the power segment, which is central to the long-term thesis of owning and monetizing energy infrastructure, actually contracted in fiscal 2025. Management attributes this to the <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241204073664/en/Ionic-Digital-Announces-Termination-of-Amended-and-Restated-Management-Services-Agreement-with-Hut-8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ionic termination</a> rather than structural weakness, and that explanation is plausible. But investors need to see power revenue grow, not shrink, for the infrastructure thesis to gain credibility. A company positioning itself as an energy infrastructure platform should, at some point, show growing energy revenue.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Contracts Are Signed</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To be fair to the bull case, recent news on the infrastructure side is genuinely encouraging. In Q4 2025, Hut 8 signed a <a href=\"https://www.hut8.com/news-insights/press-releases/hut-8-signs-15-year-245-mw-ai-data-center-lease-at-river-bend-campus\" rel=\"nofollow\">15-year lease</a> for 245 megawatts of AI data center capacity at its River Bend campus, valued at $7 billion, with payments financially backstopped by Google. The company also <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hut-8-announces-ai-infrastructure-partnership-with-anthropic-and-fluidstack-302644377.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">signed a deal</a> to build an AI data center in Louisiana for Anthropic, with Fluidstack operating the high-performance clusters, a deal management expects to generate roughly $454 million in net operating income annually over the base term. However, income from these deals is not expected to materialize until 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are not vague pipeline announcements. They are signed agreements with creditworthy counterparties. The 8,500-megawatt development pipeline now has real anchors behind it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, signed contracts and recognized net operating income are two different things. The River Bend and Anthropic deals are meaningful de-risking events for the bull case, but they don't resolve the near-term earnings picture. What matters now is execution: whether the infrastructure earnings start flowing through the income statement on schedule and at the margins management has guided to. Until it does, the valuation is still running way ahead of the financials.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Sideways Bitcoin Problem</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Bitcoin trades sideways from current levels for an extended period, Hut 8's negative forward EBITDA growth becomes even more difficult to reconcile with a 31.5x forward EV/EBITDA multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Post-halving, the operating leverage cuts both ways. Reduced block rewards mean margins are more sensitive to Bitcoin price movements than in prior cycles. The cost to mine one Bitcoin has effectively doubled in reward terms since April 2024. Current margins are holding up because the Bitcoin price has been elevated. Flat Bitcoin means the expansion that would justify the forward multiple simply doesn't arrive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Layer in the mark-to-market dynamics, and the picture gets worse. Flat Bitcoin means no unrealized gain tailwind on treasury holdings. A 20% Bitcoin decline would amplify the problem. Operating leverage works in reverse. EBITDA compresses faster than revenue. Treasury mark-to-market adds downside to already weak reported earnings.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks And Catalysts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The primary downside risk is Bitcoin price weakness combined with negative forward EBITDA growth at an elevated multiple. Multiple compression from current levels could be significant even without operational deterioration. Delays or cost overruns on the development pipeline would compound the problem.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most meaningful catalysts are concrete: River Bend and the Anthropic deal beginning to contribute real earnings, power segment recovery, and greater segment disclosure that isolates recurring infrastructure earnings from mining volatility. Cleaner reporting would itself support valuation stability. Right now, the two are too tangled together to give the market clarity.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hut 8 has made genuine progress. The near-term challenge is that reported earnings remain volatile and Bitcoin-dependent, the power segment contracted in 2025, and the stock trades at a substantial premium across every key valuation metric. The infrastructure income is coming, but is not yet reflected at scale. Until then, the premium valuation requires investors to carry both Bitcoin cyclicality and development execution risk simultaneously, which may be asking a lot. I maintain a Hold rating.</p>",

The S&amp;P 500 Index and Russell 3000 Index, each a measure of U.S. equities, rose 2.66% and 2.40%, respectively. Within the U.S. equity market, there was a broadening of<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> leadership away from the mega-cap technology stocks that had been key drivers of market performance for most of the year. Small-cap stocks produced competitive returns relative to their larger peers after lagging for the majority of 2025, as measured by the 2.19% return of the Russell 2000 Index and the 2.41% return of the Russell 1000 Index. From a style perspective, value-oriented stocks outpaced growth-oriented stocks across the capitalization spectrum. Internationally, the MSCI EAFE Index, measuring developed market equities, returned 4.86%, and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, measuring emerging markets equities, returned 4.73%, each in U.S. dollar terms. Fixed-income market returns were similarly modest but positive across the quality spectrum. Indicators suggesting softer economic growth led the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates twice during the quarter. The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index returned 1.10%. U.S. Treasuries, per the Bloomberg Treasury Index, returned 0.90%, essentially in line with the 0.84% return for investment-grade corporate bonds, per the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index. Securitized assets, per the Bloomberg U.S. Securitized Index, performed better with a return of 1.68%, with mortgage-backed securities benefiting from a relatively stable interest rate backdrop and low prepayment levels. High-yield corporate bonds, per the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High Yield Index, returned 1.31%, as the outlook for low default rates remained intact. Emerging markets debt returned 2.40%, as measured by the Bloomberg Emerging Markets USD Aggregate Index. The global fixed-income market, as measured by the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index, returned 0.24%. Commodities returned 5.85%, per the Bloomberg Commodity Index, led by precious metals.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positioning</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Absolute returns in all five portfolios of the Columbia Capital Allocation Series were positive, and, on a relative basis, the Institutional shares of all but the most conservative portfolio outperformed their respective blended benchmarks. Underlying fund manager performance within the equity asset class was the primary driver of performance across the three most aggressive portfolios; effective asset allocation decisions were the primary driver in the two most conservative portfolios. Style decisions detracted in the three most aggressive portfolios and had only a neutral to modestly additive effect in the two most conservative portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Across all five portfolios, overweighted equity exposure, especially overweights to U.S. large- and mid-cap equities, contributed positively, as did underlying fund manager performance in U.S. large- and mid-cap equities. Underlying fund manager performance within international equities detracted slightly across all five portfolios. Allocations to fixed income modestly detracted across all five portfolios, driven primarily by weak underlying fund manager performance within the asset class. Exposure to high-yield corporate bonds, which are out-of-benchmark, detracted across all five portfolios, but exposure to emerging market bonds, also out of benchmark, added value across all five portfolios. Performance across core fixed income was mixed, as negative underlying fund manager performance was offset by positive asset allocation decisions to have rather neutral effect overall in all five portfolios. A modest use of leverage to fund an overweight in equities helped across all five portfolios. Exposure to commodities contributed positively in the three most aggressive portfolios, the only portfolios to hold commodities during the quarter. Active currency positioning detracted across all five portfolios, particularly the decision to be long the Japanese yen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the quarter, we slightly increased the portfolios’ fixed-income exposure, mostly to investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, and shifted to a moderate underweight to U.S. Treasuries. While the portfolios remained overweight equities versus their respective benchmarks, we modestly decreased equity exposure, reflecting a slightly more cautious approach despite, our constructive outlook for risk assets and viewing the trim as prudent risk management rather than a strategic shift.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the end of the fourth quarter, we believed the market environment remained constructive for risk assets, supported by lower volatility, strong momentum and favorable business conditions. This view led to a moderate equity overweight in the portfolios, with valuation concerns keeping us from a larger overweight to the asset class. Within equities, we maintained high conviction in regional preferences, wherein we favored U.S., Canada and emerging markets equities over Europe, the U.K. and developed Asia ex-Japan. In fixed income, we maintained an overall neutral stance but introduced a pro-credit tilt, given our view of improved conditions for credit markets. Strategically, we believe fixed income will continue to serve as a useful portfolio diversifier, a view reinforced by lower stock/bond correlations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50624080-17722017347708473_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1277\" data-height=\"320\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50624080-17722017347708473_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Conservative Portfolio\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"160\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50624080-17722017347708473_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50624080-17722017347708473_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50624080-17722017347708473_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50624080-17722017347708473_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

The fund’s investment in <strong>other funds</strong> subjects it to the investment performance (positive or negative), risks and expenses of these underlying funds. There are risks associated with <strong>fixed-income</strong> investments, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and prepayment and extension risk. In general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer term securities. <strong>Foreign</strong> investments subject the fund to risks, including political, economic, market, social and others within a particular country, as well as to currency instabilities and less stringent financial and accounting standards generally applicable to U.S. issuers. Investing in <strong>derivatives</strong> is a specialized activity that involves special risks that subject the fund to significant loss potential, including when used as leverage, and may result in greater fluctuation in fund value. <strong>Asset allocation</strong> does not assure a profit or protect against loss.</p> <p><strong>Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a mutual fund carefully before investing.

Butterfield &amp; Son Limited (</span></span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTB\" title=\"The Bank of N.T. Butterfield &amp; Son Limited\">NTB</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">). Now I am usually not really a bank guy, but when I heard of their special geographic focus, I had to take a deeper look. Based in Bermuda with significant operations in the Cayman Islands and the Channel Islands, Butterfield caters to high-net-worth individuals, trusts and corporate clients. This unique spot in the banking landscape has allowed them to weather the storms in regional banking much better, not needing to compete aggressively for deposits.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>The stock has performed exceptionally over the last year, rallying 50% from its 52-week lows around the $35 mark, as well as recovering much faster from the 2023 lows most banks faced due to the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. I think the stock still has room to run, with most investors not yet fully understanding their offshore moat, which allows them to have a really sticky deposit base. Add on top of that a strong history of returning capital to shareholders, and you have got yourself one of the best deals in banking I could find.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Offshore Moat and Core Business Model</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>To understand Butterfield's appeal, I want to emphasize its incredibly unique structural advantage. Unlike mainland US regional banks, where the barriers to entry are low and larger national banks are mopping up more and more business as the yield-seeking retail deposit base moves quickly from bank to bank to get the best deal, Butterfield essentially operates as an oligopoly in its island jurisdictions. Bermuda and the Cayman Islands have highly concentrated banking sectors with very few players, and Butterfield acts as the no-brainer choice for most residents, local businesses as well as international trusts. For example, </span><a href=\"https://thebanks.eu/banks-by-country/Bermuda\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener noopener\">thebanks.eu</a><span> currently lists five banks operating in Bermuda, licensed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, of which the second-largest, HSBC Bermuda, has an asset base only about half the size of Butterfield's. So plain and simple, there's just no one else to go to if you're looking for a mortgage or a deposit account, so Butterfield can charge a premium. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>This dynamic creates a much more sticky and low-cost deposit base compared to most banks you will be familiar with in the US. Customers keep their funds at Butterfield not necessarily for the yield, but for the transactional utility and specialized trust services the bank provides. This structural advantage has enabled Butterfield to earn an ROE most other banks would be salivating at the sight of. Take a look at a quick comparison to US regional and national banking peers over the last 10 years: </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_4ec2324cc56434d14fb7a549473cb53a.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_4ec2324cc56434d14fb7a549473cb53a.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_4ec2324cc56434d14fb7a549473cb53a.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_4ec2324cc56434d14fb7a549473cb53a.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FY 2025 and Q4 Earnings Review: Strong Execution Across the Board </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Butterfield's <a href=\"https://www.butterfieldgroup.com/sites/butterfield-corp/files/butterfield/investor-relations/financial-reports/annual/annual-report-2025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">most recent report</a> shows them once again humming along and bringing good results as they utilize their special spot in the banking world. The bank posted quarterly earnings of $1.54 per diluted share, beating the consensus estimate of $1.47 by about 5%. Total revenue for the quarter came in at $158.9 million, topping estimates of $153 million and representing solid year-over-year growth. Now, while the growth is nothing to scoff at, it's not really what excites me the most. Several other factors stood out to me:</span> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Net Interest Margin (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NIM\" title=\"Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund\">NIM</a>) Expansion:<strong> </strong></span><span>While many banks saw their margins squeezed in 2025, Butterfield’s NIM actually increased by 5 basis points to 2.69% for the full year. On top of that, the average cost of deposits fell to 1.5%, with management again underscoring my point of the unique customer base and business model driving this dynamic</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Surging Non-Interest Income:<strong> </strong><span>The bank generated $66.3 million in non-interest income in Q4, an increase of $5.1 million from the previous quarter. While part of this was driven by seasonal card volumes, the higher foreign exchange fees and trust income will be something to look out for in the next quarters. The trust segment includes contributions from the integration of the acquired Credit Suisse book, so that seems to be going well for the company. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Exceptional Return on Equity: <span>As already mentioned, Butterfield's impressive ROE track record continued into the fourth quarter with an ROE of 21.7% and a core Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (ROATCE) of 24.2%. In the banking sector, an ROATCE above 15% is generally considered excellent; with Butterfield operating above 20% and even near 25%, places it in the top tier of financial institutions. If this metric doesn't get you interested, or even better, a bit suspicious, then I don't know what will.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h3> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Asset Quality and Balance Sheet Health</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Let's take a closer look at Butterfield’s books; I want to get the confidence that their high ROE is not just built on excessive risk-taking. But luckily, from what I was able to glean from a look into their balance sheet, Butterfield has backed up its high ROE with prudent risk management, once again on display in their Q4 report. </span> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Credit performance remained quite stable in the quarter, with the bank reporting <a href=\"https://www.butterfieldgroup.com/sites/butterfield-corp/files/2026-02/NTB-4Q25-and-Full-Year-Earnings-Presentation-February-10-2026.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">zero net charge-offs</a>, bringing the full-year net charge-off ratio for 2025 to a negligible 0.01%. Non-accrual loans are holding steady at roughly 2%, and the allowance for credit losses (ACL) remains at an adequate 0.6%. </span> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772016254690327_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"782\" data-height=\"426\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772016254690327_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Butterfield's Portfolio Distribution\" width=\"640\" height=\"349\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772016254690327_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772016254690327_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772016254690327_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772016254690327_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Butterfield's Portfolio Distribution <span>(Butterfield Group Investor Relations)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>I’d also like to highlight Butterfield’s loan distribution</span>. 71% of its loan portfolio consists of full-recourse residential mortgages. Additionally, 79% of these loans have loans-to-value ratios (LTVs) below 70%, giving them ample room to withstand any real estate shocks. This means even in a scenario where island real estate prices drop by 20% to 30%, Butterfield has a meaningful equity buffer before principal impairment becomes likely. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of this, Butterfield maintains a much more conservative balance sheet, compared to its US peers, as well as to the benchmarks set out by regulators, as measured by its regulatory capital to total capital ratio. This measure signals that Butterfield has a very large cushion against losses set up. On the other hand, tangible common equity (TCE) is a bit lower than the US median, with 7.5% TCE and 8.6% excluding cash, meaning they are more leveraged than peers, so any losses that do pile up eat into equity faster. However, looking at some larger US regional banking peers, Butterfield's TCE is very much in its expected range, with Regions Financial's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RF\" title=\"Regions Financial Corporation\">RF</a>) 7.76%, Citizens Financial's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CFG\" title=\"Citizens Financial Group, Inc.\">CFG</a>) 7.5% and KeyCorp's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KEY\" title=\"KeyCorp\">KEY</a>) slightly higher 8.36%, as well as above their own target range of 6.0% to 6.5%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720172859122522_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1227\" data-height=\"408\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720172859122522_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Butterfield Balance Sheet Risk Measures 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"213\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720172859122522_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720172859122522_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720172859122522_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720172859122522_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Butterfield Group Investor Relations</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h3> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capital Returns: A Shareholder Yield Machine</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another major positive for me is management's relentless commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Because Butterfield requires very little capital to fund its growth and ongoing business, management chooses to reward shareholders and directs nearly all of it back to investors. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Share Repurchases: In 2025, the bank bought back 3.5 million shares at a total cost of $146.7 million. Because the stock has historically traded at a low multiple, these buybacks have been highly accretive to tangible book value, which grew by 21.7% in 2025 to end the year at $26.41 per share. Looking ahead, the Board has recently authorized a new 3.0 million share repurchase program (worth roughly $150 million) effective through December 2026. If all of the 3 million shares are repurchased, this would represent about 7% of Butterfield's shares outstanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividends: The bank recently declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. At current prices, this translates to a reliable forward dividend yield of roughly 3.9%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When you add those two sources of capital returns together, Butterfield boasts a total payout ratio of about 100% of its earnings. This creates a massive yield for long-term holders of the stock, and establishes a solid floor under the share price. Importantly, buybacks are discretionary, giving management flexibility if conditions tighten. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772019557999942.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Butterfield Payout Ratio\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"622\" height=\"367\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772019557999942.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772019557999942.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772019557999942.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Butterfield Group Investor Relations</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation: Still Room to Run</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Despite the stock's recent performance, I think Butterfield is far from overvalued. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Currently trading at around $51, the stock is valued at a trailing P/E of 9.32x and a forward P/E of 8.61x. This is quite a bit lower than the broader sector median of almost 13x, as calculated by Seeking Alpha’s Quant dashboard. Given Butterfield’s much superior ROE of 21.49%, low credit risk, and strong history of shareholder capital returns, I, personally, would argue that Butterfield should even deserve a premium multiple, rather than the current discount. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720477625943882.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha Quant Valuation Rating\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"578\" height=\"846\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720477625943882.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720477625943882.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720477625943882.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha Quant Rating</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>If the market were to re-rate Butterfield to even just a modest trailing P/E multiple of 12, still below the sector median and far away from the premium I would be happy to pay, we would expect a return of almost 30%, even before accounting for dividends. The market’s hesitance likely stems from a lack of familiarity with the offshore banking jurisdiction that is at the source of the structural pricing advantage. Even if investors continue to not pay attention to the Butterfield’s fundamentals, the strong buyback initiative active at the moment gives me confidence that sooner or later, the market will be able to price their unique situation. Until that takes place, we can enjoy the good dividend policy. </span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I can see a couple of headwinds that could impact my investment thesis:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Geographic Concentration: <span>Butterfield’s business is inherently tied to the health and real estate markets of its three major operational jurisdictions. </span><span>A severe hurricane or a local economic downturn could hurt their operations and spike credit costs. Additionally, due to operating in the UK’s Channel Islands, around 25% of their book has exposure to GBP, adding some slight currency risk. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regulatory Changes:<span> Being concentrated in offshore tax havens means any sweeping changes in global minimum tax regulations or trust reporting standards could impact the attractiveness of Butterfield's businesses. And just in general, the \"offshore tax haven\" angle of the investment definitely turns off many investors, likely being partially responsible for Butterfield being so overlooked at the moment.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interest Rate Sensitivity:<span> While Butterfield was able to manage their interest rate exposure well over the last interest rate cycle, they do report a larger exposure to a change in rates than their US peers. Specifically, a cut in rates by the Fed or the Bank of England could pressure the yields on their investment portfolio, which is heavily exposed to medium-term US Treasuries and MBS.

It offers investors access to a bank entrenched in a niche market, operating highly profitably, while actively returning capital to investors by shrinking its share count and paying a healthy dividend. The 2025 earnings update as well as the new share buyback program gives me confidence that management is focusing on the right things: expanding margins, keeping a lid on credit costs, and successfully integrating their M&amp;A trust acquisitions. </span></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Trading at under 10x earnings while having an ROE of over 20% just doesn’t make sense, but does offer us a compelling upside and a wide margin of safety. As the market wakes up to the durability of Butterfield's offshore moat, a multiple re-rating feels more and more like an inevitability. While I by no means expect Butterfield to grow by large margins in the coming future, I see them humming along at their currently strong baseline, continuing to give back what they earn to the shareholders, slowly but surely buying up the float, and paying a sizeable dividend. For that reason, I issue a Buy rating. </span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h3>",
