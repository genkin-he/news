This is where I end up looking at things much differently, because I read through the entire earnings report and listen to the earnings call before forming an opinion. Shares of META fell as low as $650.25 as the headline news made the financial community question the CapEx spend and make references to the Metaverse. It wasn’t possible for anyone to go through the data while the sell-off was happening considering the conference call hadn’t happened nor is it possible to read a press release and the financial statements in a millisecond. The main point that the algo’s and traders didn’t calculate in their decisions to sell is that the </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285165-meta-reports-third-quarter-2025-results\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285165-meta-reports-third-quarter-2025-results\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">EPS miss</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> was because of a $18.95 billion tax expense which increased more than $16.5 billion QoQ. They also didn’t see that despite increasing the CapEx spend in Q3 by more than $3 billion to $19.85 billion, their cash generated from operations increased by more than $4 billion QoQ to $29.99 billion. I believe that the sell-off is creating an opportunity for long-term investors and while things could be volatile for some time I believe META will be one of the companies leading the market higher in 2026.</span></p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"889\" data-height=\"309\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Meta\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"222\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Following up on my previous article about META</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in August I wrote an article about META after they reported Q2 earnings (can be read here). Since then shares of META have declined by -8.65% while the S&amp;P 500 has increased by 7.52%. I had discussed how META delivered a blowout Q2 which was driven by AI-fueled ad growth and unmatched user engagement as they crushed revenue and EPS estimates. I envisioned a long growth runway as Meta continued to leverage AI, wearables, and its massive user base to unlock new revenue streams and profitability. I felt that the market was underestimating Meta’s AI wearables and future earnings potential as I have learned not to discount Mark Zuckerbergs vision. I am following up with a new article to discuss why I think the market is wrong on META and how this will ultimately turn into an opportunity for long-term investors.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"873\" data-height=\"248\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Meta\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"182\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>What the investment didn’t have time to see as they were fixated on the large EPS miss</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The whole point of quarterly earnings reports is to inform the market and more importantly the shareholders about the progress that is being made within a company. People trading around headlines without caring about the substance within the earnings report is short term capital and that doesn’t matter to me. On the top-line <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285165-meta-reports-third-quarter-2025-results\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285165-meta-reports-third-quarter-2025-results\" target=\"_blank\">META</a> beat revenue estimates by $1.83 billion as they generated $51.24 billion throughout Q3. The reason why everyone sold the news was because META missed on EPS by -$5.66 and generated $1.05 of EPS. If people actually waited until the earnings call was over they would have learned that EPS was down because of a onetime noncash reduction in deferred tax assets that META no longer anticipates using under the new U.S. tax law. Their tax rate would have been 14% if it wasn’t for this charge, instead it was 87%. This is where the market can become shortsighted and created opportunities for long-term investors. Later in the earnings call Susan Li (META CFO) discussed that the transition to the new U.S. tax law may have resulted in an accounting charge in Q3 but they are expecting to recognize significant cash tax savings for the remainder of 2025 and future years going forward. In my opinion this is a horrible reason to dump META as the short term money is more interested in immediate gratification rather than what will ultimately benefit the company going forward.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1432\" data-height=\"559\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"META Cash from Ops\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"250\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Steven Fiorillo, Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is one of the biggest aspects that was overlooked and why I prefer to look at the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META/cash-flow-statement\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META/cash-flow-statement\" target=\"_blank\">cash flow statement</a> over the income statement in many scenarios. I care more about the cash that META is generating from operations and what they are doing with the cash rather than worrying about a one-time tax charge. The reality is that META has continued to increase their CapEx, but their cash from operations continues to expand. META has generated $107.57 billion in cash from operations in the TTM which is an increase of 17.79% YoY ($16.25 billion). The bottom line is that in order for META to increase their revenue they need to reinvest in their buisness. Despite CapEx increasing by 65.15% YoY to $61.53 billion META is still generating $44.23 billion in free cash flow (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCF\" title=\"First Commonwealth Financial Corporation\">FCF</a>). The other aspect that I believe was overlooked was the actual metrics from Q3. META’s cash from operations increased by $4.44 billion (17.36%) QoQ while their CapEx increase by $3.31 billion (20.03%). META allocated 20.03% more toward CapEx but their quarterly FCF actually increased to $10.15 billion (12.47%) QoQ. So what are people really mad at? I believe that people are getting frantic that the days of spending frivolously on the Metaverse are back but I have a news flash for those investors. This time it’s the entire segment of big tech and not just META. This is the way of the future and to get there these companies need to make massive investments and they are funding it through profitability.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1386\" data-height=\"608\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q3 Deck\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"281\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>META</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside of the crazy interpretation of why META actually missed, I felt this was another strong quarter. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285165-meta-reports-third-quarter-2025-results\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285165-meta-reports-third-quarter-2025-results\" target=\"_blank\">META</a> grew their revenue 26% YoY to $51.24 billion while increasing their gross profit by 26.66% ($8.82 billion) to $42.04 billion. META’s income from operations increased 18% YoY to $20.54 billion. It’s crazy that people wanted to sell off a company that has a 82.03% gross profit margin and is operating at a 40.01% margin. The buisness is humming as the family of apps revenue generated $50.77 billion while Reality Labs revenue increased 74% YoY to $470 million. META was in a position to repurchase $3.16 billion of Calls A shares while paying out $1.33 billion in dividends during Q3. I think a big factor to keep in mind is that their net income would have increased by $15.93 billion to $18.64 billion, compared to the reported net income of $2.71 billion. I think everyone should keep in mind that there were 3.54 billion family daily active people using their products which was an increase of 8% YoY while the ad impressions delivered across their family of apps increased by 14%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>There is a lot to be excited about as META continues to position themselves for the future</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">META continues to position itself for the future by aggressively investing in A.I. which could end up ushering in a new windfall of revenue. Meta is focused on establishing itself as the leading frontier A.I. lab and building personal superintelligence that everyone can utilize. Through META’s superintelligence offerings they are focused on delivering A.I. experiences and computing devices that impact the users that utilize their products. META also continues to lead the marketplace with A.I. glasses as they continue to develop next generation of models and products. META recently announced their 2025 line of Meta Ray-Ban display glasses at Connect which feature a high-resolution display and new AI capabilities. META believes that these endeavors with the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta products will become very profitable products that will be accretive to the bottom line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">META is in a position to leverage it’s A.I. capabilities to enhance its highly profitable family of apps segment to unlock new revenue streams. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835033-meta-platforms-inc-meta-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835033-meta-platforms-inc-meta-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">META</a> is expecting to advance its recommendation systems across several avenues through 2026. This would include surface content that caters to diverse user interests on Instagram while progressing on longer-term ranking innovations in 2026 as they create foundational ranking models and developing new model innovations to produce more relevant recommendations. Reels has grown into an annual run-rate business that exceeds $50 billion as the overall time spent on Facebook and Instagram grew double digits year-over-year in Q3 which was driven by video. The advertising revenue from advertisers using end-to-end automated solutions such as Advantage+ lead campaigns has reached $60 billion. META continues to refine ad supply across its to deliver better and more relevant ads. META continues to see a lot of growth in business messaging which grew 60% YoY and they are opening business AIs to businesses across messaging platforms to help scale conversations and improve sales.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"999\" data-height=\"214\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"META EPS\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"137\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Steven Fiorillo, Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The haircut that META took has made it the cheapest stock in big-tech on a forward earnings basis. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META/earnings/estimates\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META/earnings/estimates\" target=\"_blank\">META</a> is now expected to generate $27.05 in EPS during 2025 and $33.62 in 2027 which is an increase of $6.56 or 24.25% over the next 2-years. META is now the only company in the Magnificent Seven which is trading under 20 times 2027 earnings. The one-time tax expense that META just incurred is nothing more than a one-time expense and this isn’t changing the forward EPS outlook in the analyst projections. This makes me bullish on the long-term potential from the current valuation META is getting and I think this will be looked at as a buying opportunity a year from now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks to investing in META</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I am bullish on META after the sell-off there are several risk factors to consider. Everyone should do their own due diligence as my speculations could be incorrect. Over the past 2-years META has generated $197.33 billion in income operating income from it’s family of apps and generated -$39.29 billion in operating income from Reality Labs. When these are netted out META has still generated $158.04 billion in income from operations over the past 2-years. Part of the reason why META was selling off is because a segment of the investing community is worried that META is gong to continue to increase their spend on CapEX and A.I. won’t be there profit center that META envisions it will and it will look much more like Reality Labs. The A.I. landscape could also take much longer for META to monetize compared to the amount of capital their allocating toward it and this could negatively impact earnings. There is a lot for investors to consider so please do your due diligence before starting a position in META.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1283\" data-height=\"194\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q3 Deck\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"97\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Meta Platforms</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that the sell-off was unwarranted and that META got caught in the cross-fire between stop-losses and algos trading. The reality is that META had a one-time $18.95 billion tax expense that caused them to produce a major miss on EPS. META got caught in a downtrend immediately without anyone getting a chance to read through earnings or listen to the call. META’s cash generated from operations increased by more than $4 billion QoQ to $29.99 billion which outpaced the $3 billion that CapEx increased by. META is expecting that they will generate between $56-59 billion of revenue in Q4 and I am expecting that their EPS will be back to normal as their CFO said that the new tax law would create a tailwind for earnings going forward. I believe that META is trading at a strong valuation at less than 20 times 2027 earnings and that we will look back on this period as a buying opportunity rather than the current picture that is being painted of the sky is falling.</p>",

But the nowcast suggests that there was a fair amount of growth momentum in the previous quarter to keep recession risk low.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The partially updated <a href=\"https://www.dallasfed.org/research/wei\" rel=\"noopener\">Weekly Economic Index</a> (WEI), published by the Dallas Fed, suggests as much. WEI edged down to a 2.0% pace for the week through Oct. 25, an estimate that equates with a four-quarter GDP growth that’s slightly below the 2.1% pace reported for Q2. The report suggests that the economic trend is holding steady. But since some of WEI inputs – weekly jobless claims, for instance – aren’t updating, the latest estimate may be misleading.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Optimists can also point to the Atlanta Fed’s <a href=\"https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow\" rel=\"noopener\">GDPNow model</a>, which is currently estimating a strong 3.9% for Q3 economic activity (as of Oct. 27) – well above the median estimate in the chart above and slightly faster than the Q2 advance. But here, too, the updates should be viewed with a non-trivial degree of skepticism due to the missing data for some of the model’s inputs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The government shutdown is costing the economy about $7 billion per month, according to a <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-10/61823-Shutdown.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">new report</a> by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). That’s a rounding error for a $30 trillion economy, but it’s still another headwind at a time when signs of a labor market downshift have been persuading the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This much is clear: the longer the shutdown lasts, the stronger the headwind. Meantime, it’s still reasonable to guesstimate that economic activity grew at a moderate pace in Q3. The outlook for Q4, by contrast, is far more uncertain from the perspective of developing a reasonably accurate nowcast. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.capitalspectator.com/us-economy-probably-grew-at-solid-pace-in-q3/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

This is likely due to a combination of low growth rates (typical of a large company) and what is likely an average valuation for the industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But the price-earnings ratio shown above is well below the average for the market. That would imply that even if the valuation is average as the quant system shows, there could be more stock price progress made as long as the turnaround continues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now with that quant system rating, this may not be the most favorable time for stock price appreciation. After all, the market is looking towards a recession with the implication of weak commodity prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But that is just the time to consider an integrated major. This is the type of company that will lead any industry recovery. Because of the quant system rating, the stock price (in the judgement of the quant system) has a fair chance of going down before it goes up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But given the low visibility of the industry and commodity prices in general, it may be wise to consider dollar cost averaging rather than going \"all-in\" at once.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability, which happens to be my favorite, is rated excellent. Revisions and Momentum are likely keeping the stock price from following much of the industry. Management announced some more portfolio moves to adjust profitability. Each move itself may not be all that material to the latest results. But if management keeps \"tweaking\" the portfolio correctly, then over time a lot of losers will be gone before they can hurt results.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Major Project Pipeline</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like most majors, this company has a long list of upcoming major projects that will likely replace some things that were sold or shut down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2173\" data-height=\"1205\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shell Corporation List Of Material Projects Coming Online In The Near Future\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shell Corporation List Of Material Projects Coming Online In The Near Future <span>(Shell Corporate Presentation Third Quarter 2025)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.shell.com/investors/results-and-reporting/quarterly-results/_jcr_content/root/main/section/simple_copy/promo_1962010312_cop/links/item3.stream/1761789807852/d5fdd917d2b521125c2a10067399225077314fb2/q3-2025-slides.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Since Shell has moved</a> to England (as the last article noted), the company has been justifying that move by refocusing the business on its main oil and gas roots.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the company does venture into \"green\" projects, then those projects have to meet the same profit criteria as the main line of business.

Earnings are still lower this fiscal year than last year. But Mr. Market is always concerned with what is being done recently. A strong quarter can often overcome the reality of the fiscal year results.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Debt Issue</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a side issue the net debt figure also declined in the latest quarterly report. The debt is still above the previous fiscal year. But that decline may well relieve some investors who were worried about climbing debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Understand that the debt was well within \"safe\" territory. The company could likely afford more debt and still be investment grade. However, for those of us who remember back in the late 1970s and early 1980s about Exxon Mobil Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>) having a debt issue that went from next to nothing to a whole $4 billion, there will always be those investors that worry about rising debt, no matter how safe the debt level is. There are enough of them to significantly affect market valuations of at least some stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What any investor needs to understand is that there is a world of difference between rising investment-grade debt levels and non-investment-grade debt that sends the debt ratio \"off the charts\". The reason is that part of the evaluation that leads to an investment-grade rating is that the management will deal with debt issues on a prompt basis (compared to companies with below-investment-grade ratings). This is a general rule and not company-specific. But it does mean that rising investment-grade debt levels are usually not a factor to worry about.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the website noted, Shell<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511031-shell-misses-top-line-and-bottom-line-estimates-initiates-q4-outlook\"> beat the consensus</a>. Some of that beat was likely due to the idea of Shell in the past rather than the progress being made by the refocusing effort. Many times, the consensus is based on the history of the company. But this company is demonstrating that it does not intend to follow that history. Instead, it intends to improve upon that history.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That makes this idea a strong buy for buy-and-hold investors. This is a growth and income story that has an additional boost from the ongoing turnaround effort. A diversified company like this with a relatively high debt rating is considered below average risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But despite the stock price appreciation, the price-earnings ratio is still low during a period of weak commodity prices. To me, this is nothing close to a cyclical top. Instead, weak commodity prices imply a bottom at some point in the future. Generally, cyclical stocks look very expensive at cyclical bottoms due to a lack of earnings. That could mean there is far more long-term upside potential than the market gives this stock credit for.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current bargaining that is resulting in threats of trade wars and tariffs needs to be replaced with something constructive and permanent. If the political uncertainty caused by this bargaining continues, then the much-feared recession can well become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Business tends to \"hunker down\" and pull back during times of uncertainty. The latest <a href=\"https://www.dallasfed.org/research/surveys/des/2025/2503\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dallas Fed Report</a> confirms that trend with a worse 2026 on the way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The uncertainty could make for lower-than-expected commodity prices that are sustained for longer than expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, a diversified company like this one will come through such a period in better shape than many in the industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk is whether or not the stock simplification and the accompanying move to England will pay off in the long run. There are clearly some short-term benefits from the move. But the situation can change to make the move unexpectedly unfavorable or at least not worth the effort.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Taking a step back and evaluating the overall market: the Pandemic inflation surge has passed, enabling the Fed to cut interest rates further this year – which is historically a positive for equity markets; earnings have proven to be resilient and continue to broaden out beyond the Magnificent 7; and secular forces, such as productivity gains from generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI), continue to provide markets an additional tailwind.</li> <li>As we look ahead, innovation is flourishing in many areas of the US economy, and we are continuing to find quality companies across the market cap spectrum in these favored areas. These areas include, but are not limited to, pioneering Gen AI companies in semiconductors and software, as well as industrial companies enabling datacenter expansion and power infrastructure to support it. We are excited about AI’s role in the emerging defense and space technology sector, as a historically low growth area sees an inflection in autonomous software and hardware systems. This positive inflection is also benefiting areas such as cloud, e-commerce, mobility, search, and social networks, as well as non-technology sectors such as Communication Services, Consumer, and Health Care.</li> <li>That said, there are several countervailing factors still in play, such as policy uncertainty. Therefore, we believe security selection is more important than ever as high-quality businesses with strong business models and exceptional management teams should be better equipped to pass through tariffs, adjust supply chains, and find productivity gains from Gen AI tools.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>TOP 10 ACTIVE OVERWEIGHT POSITIONS</strong></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Company</strong></p></td> <td> <p><strong>Fund Weight</strong></p> <p><strong>(%)</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Index Weight</strong></p> <p><strong>(%)</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Active Weight</strong></p> <p><strong>(%)</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Market Cap</strong></p> <p><strong>($B)</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>AppLovin Corp.</p></td> <td><p>3.4</p></td> <td><p>0.5</p></td> <td><p>+2.9</p></td> <td><p>219.1</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Arista Networks, Inc.

I had a HOLD rating on the name.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the article was published, the stock hit my then price target of $542 before tumbling, registering an overall decline of 1.30%, compared with a gain of 8.21% for the S&amp;P 500 during the same period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MSFT announced its Q1 results yesterday and despite a strong quarter, the stock still slipped. In this article, I analyse the Q1 numbers and the overall report in detail to identify what factors could have led to the post-earnings selloff. Moreover, MSFT went into the earnings release with the stock near all-time highs. Therefore, I also analyse the company’s valuation using a quantitative model to see if it was a factor behind the selloff.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>A Snapshot of Q1 Earnings Report </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MSFT started the new fiscal year strongly, comfortably beating both the top- and bottom-line estimates. More specifically, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285087-microsoft-cloud-and-ai-strength-drives-first-quarter-results\">Q1 revenues came in at $77.67 billion</a>, up 17% y/y on a constant currency basis and beating analyst estimates by $2.28 billion. Diluted EPS came in at $4.13, up 21% y/y on a constant currency basis, and comfortably beating analyst estimates by $0.47. Operating margins were strong, coming in at 49%, which translates to an expansion of 200 bps (or 2%) y/y and an expansion of 410 bps (or 4.1%) sequentially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The guidance from the company was also strong, with Q2 revenues expected to be in the range between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion and operating margins expected to be flat on a y/y basis and down sequentially, <em>“<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835092-microsoft-corporation-msft-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">aligned with historic seasonality</a>.” </em>Capital expenditures, a metric that investors keenly watch out for, when it comes to companies such as MSFT, are now projected to not only grow sequentially but also are expected to have a higher growth rate in FY26 relative to FY25.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Azure’s Strength &amp; Massive Bookings Jump Justifies Further Capex Spend</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MSFT’s stock, at the time of writing, is down 2.2%, and it is hard for me to identify the precise catalyst behind the sell-off. It could be that the stock was at an all-time high going into the earnings, or it could be because of the increasing capex spending that the company announced at the time of reporting Q2 results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If it’s the latter that’s driving the sell-off, then the reaction, in my view, is certainly overdone. This is because if one looks at the overall performance of the company as well as the underlying demand that continues to outpace supply, then I don’t see any option in front of the company other than to spend more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Take Azure, for instance. The segment came into the quarter with a lot of momentum and has exited the quarter with even more momentum, as it delivered a 40% y/y growth. And while on a sequential basis, the growth has only marginally ticked up from 39%, this time last year, Azure’s revenue growth stood at 33%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, the demand for Azure continues to remain strong, as evidenced by a massive jump in the commercial bookings, which increased 111% in constant currency in Q1. The growth does not account for the additional $250 billion Azure commitments from OpenAI that was announced as part of the ChatGPT-parent’s restructuring plans, which suggests that the growth is likely to continue. Furthermore, as further evidence of how substantial the demand for Azure is, MSFT announced that its commercial remaining performance obligations reached $392 billion, which translates to a growth of 51% y/y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1447\" data-height=\"736\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A chart showing the y/y revenue growth of MSFT's Commercial RPOs\" width=\"640\" height=\"326\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>MSFT Press Releases</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As evidenced by the above chart, this is the highest RPO growth in the last five quarters and given that the growth stood at 21% this time last year, it reflects the significant contribution that AI has played both with respect to Azure and with respect to Microsoft 365. What is even more impressive, to me, is that the weighted average duration has remained stable, despite the huge growth, at 2 years. It was also notable that management, during the earnings call, mentioned that there was sufficient breadth in the demand (numerous products, customers of all sizes) since this mitigates some of the concentration risk that the company has, with OpenAI as one of its largest customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the rapid growth seen in bookings and given that the company is generating a substantial ROI on its capex, I don’t see any reason for the company to not spend more on capital expenditures and mitigate the capacity constraints. The company has been spending while maintaining strong margins and strong growth, and with such high demand, I don’t think this time’s going to be any different. This is primarily why I believe that the negative stock reaction, post earnings release, is overdone if capex spend is the catalyst.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is not to say that it was a perfect quarter from MSFT. For instance, MSFT reported a $3.1 billion loss this quarter compared to a $523 million loss during the same period last year. This is a substantial amount, and when asked about it during the earnings call, CFO Amy Hood confirmed that it was indeed the case, which is a substantial figure in my opinion. Ms. Hood also highlighted in her prepared remarks that going forward, outlook for other income and expense will exclude “<em>any impact from our investments in OpenAI,”</em> due to the “<em>ongoing nature of our partnership resulting in increased volatility.”</em> This is not exactly reassuring to investors, at least in near-to-medium term, especially with MSFT boosting their capex spending. This could be one of the reasons why the stock is down post-earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, Azure’s growth in Q2 is projected to slide down to 37% due to capacity constraints, which could have also triggered a knee-jerk reaction. Finally, while the company’s search business has shown accelerated growth in recent quarters, the growth rate may be stalling, or even declining, as shown below. While search is a small part of the company’s business, MSFT’s AI moves were expected to keep the segment’s growth momentum going.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1026\" data-height=\"460\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A chart showing the y/y growth in MSFT's Search &amp; News Business\" width=\"640\" height=\"287\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>MSFT Q1FY26 Earnings Call Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, it was a strong quarter from MSFT. The announcement of an increase in capex spending in FY26 seems to have not gone down well with the market. However, given that the company’s core segments that rely on these investments are generating substantial growth, and with demand continuing to outpace supply, I don’t see a reason why the company should slow down its spending. Moreover, it has the cash to spend as well as return excess capital to shareholders, so I don’t see a problem in this move by MSFT.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Valuation</strong></h2> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <td><p>Forward P/E Multiple Approach</p></td> <td> </td> </tr></thead> <tr class=\"bg-y\"> <td><p>Price Target</p></td> <td><p>$558.00</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Projected Forward P/E Multiple</p></td> <td><p>34.85x</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Projected EPS in the next twelve months</p></td> <td><p>$16.01</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sources: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT/valuation/metrics\">Seeking Alpha</a> and Author’s Chosen Model (MS-ARIMA)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I deployed a Markov-Switching Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (MS-ARIMA) model to forecast MSFT’s EPS for the rest of FY26. MS-ARIMA is a regime-switching time-series model that addresses structural breaks, unlike traditional ARIMA models. MSFT is a company that has regularly gone through regime changes, with the AI revolution being the latest switch and therefore, MS-ARIMA is an appropriate model to predict MSFT’s future EPS. More information on the model can be found <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1912559\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data on MSFT’s EPS was obtained from <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Financial Modelling Prep</a>. EPS for the last twelve quarters were selected to ensure that there was a fine balance between recency and stability. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions were then deployed on the 12-quarter window. The model was validated through out-of-sample testing on the last three quarters. The out-of-sample testing resulted in the following model metrics:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <td><p>Metric</p></td> <td><p>MS-ARIMA</p></td> <td><p>Notes</p></td> </tr></thead> <tr> <td><p>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</p></td> <td><p>0.252</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)</p></td> <td><p>0.286</p></td> <td><p>Values close to MAE suggest that there are no extreme outliers in both models.</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)</p></td> <td><p>6.68%</p></td> <td><p>MAPE values under 10% shows that the model is very good for forecasting. The directional accuracy of the model is 100%, which supports the model accuracy.</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other forecasting models such as Prophet and Random Forests were also deployed, but the MS-ARIMA had the lowest errors compared to these models, which further validated its selection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The MS-ARIMA model was then used to forecast the EPS of the next three quarters of FY26, and the results are shown below:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <td><p>Quarter-End</p></td> <td><p>Projected EPS</p></td> </tr></thead> <tr> <td><p>Q2 FY26</p></td> <td><p>$3.84</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q3 FY26</p></td> <td><p>$3.96</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q4 FY26</p></td> <td><p>$4.08</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The total EPS for FY26 would be $16.01. According to Seeking Alpha, MSFT currently trades at a forward P/E 34.85x. At this multiple and with a projected FY26 of $16.01, my price target for MSFT is $558, which represents about 6% upside from current levels. The limited upside is unsurprising, given that the stock was trading at all-time highs prior to earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a momentum perspective, MSFT’s momentum has weakened in the last three months, as evidenced by the C+ grade on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT/momentum/performance\">Seeking Alpha’s momentum scale</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taking these together, the current levels are not attractive to initiate a position based on my analysis. As such, I am maintaining my HOLD rating. Having said that, any major pullback in the name warrants a buying opportunity in my view. Finally, I don’t see any reason for existing investors to exit their positions at current levels given the strong tailwinds that the company has.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MSFT had a strong start to the year, with a beat on both the top- and bottom-lines. The company further justified its massive capex spending, as evidenced by the strong growth seen in Azure as well as the exponential growth seen in its commercial bookings. Operating margins were also very strong.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Post the earnings release, despite delivering a strong quarter, the stock fell, which I believe could be either due to the significant jump in OpenAI-related losses, or the projected deceleration in Azure in Q2 due to capacity constraints. An alternative to these two causes would be valuation, which my analysis suggests is the case. MSFT went into the earnings near all-time highs, so any negative news was bound to get punished. While my rating on the stock is HOLD, it’s on a pure valuation basis and not due to the fundamentals of the business. Any major pullback would be a buying opportunity in my view. Given the negative sentiment I am currently seeing in the market because of the irrational fear for capex spending, I believe such opportunities should be around the corner.</p>",

The European Central Bank calls this ‘the good<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> place’ that it's currently in, illustrating that boring times are the best times for central bankers. It made yesterday’s decision to hold rates quite straightforward, and today’s numbers emphasise that this was probably the right call. Eurozone inflation has moved within 0.2ppt of the 2% target since March, and we don’t expect it to deviate much for the foreseeable future.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, at the ECB press conference yesterday, President Christine Lagarde emphasised the concern around services inflation being persistently too high to balance out downside risks to inflation. Today’s data actually showed a further acceleration in services inflation, from 3.2 to 3.4%. The focus has been a bit more on downside risks to the inflation outlook in recent weeks, which could well push the inflation outlook lower. Today’s data stresses that the risks to the outlook do remain quite balanced, though, and resulted in a still-elevated core inflation rate at 2.4%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Inflation is measured on a year-on-year basis, but the shorter-term developments do show a slight pickup of momentum in core inflation on the back of services prices. The three-month rate of core inflation is currently increasing to an annualised 2.7% rate. Then again, selling price expectations for services have eased further, which is a decent predictor of future price developments. For the months ahead, we do expect a further easing of the inflation rate, but not much below the 2% mark. The 'good place' seems to be with us for some time to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Steel has always been the centre of gravity for vanadium. But for the first time, that balance is beginning to shift...As long-duration battery technology gains ground, vanadium is increasingly being pulled into the energy transition, particularly through vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), which use the metal as their key electrolyte. VRFBs are not new, but they are now entering a more serious growth phase. <strong>Installed capacity is expected to rise ten-fold by 2030, moving from 4 GWh today to around 40 GWh, with potential annual deployments of up to 50 GWh.</strong> As this happens, the amount of vanadium directed to battery storage could climb from around 5% of total supply to nearly 27% over the next five years. </p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Note: Bold emphasis by the author.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vanadium miner news</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>Vanadium producers</em></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>G</strong><strong>lencore [LSX:GLEN] [HK:805] (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLCNF\">OTCPK:GLCNF</a>)</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Glencore is a large vanadium producer, but vanadium production represents only a small portion of their revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On October 17 Mining Weekly <a href=\"https://www.miningweekly.com/article/community-unrest-erupts-at-glencores-rhovan-mine-after-expiry-of-solar-project-contracts-2025-10-17\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Community unrest erupts at Glencore’s Rhovan mine after expiry of solar project contracts...Rhovan, a vanadium mining and processing facility managed by Glencore Ferroalloys, began construction of the solar plant in 2024 as part of its efforts to support sustainable energy use...Now, after being notified that their contracts will not be renewed, the affected employees have expressed dissatisfaction and initiated a labour dispute, demanding continued employment.

As some might remember, I invested in the stock between 2020 and 2024. At first, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4528578-stellantis-undervaluation-is-harder-and-harder-to-justify\">I thought the stock was deeply undervalued,</a> and I indeed saw my gains double. But <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4652229-stellantis-was-about-to-sell-but-didnt\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">I was slow to realize</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> how Stellantis' success hinged on supply chain bottlenecks. Once these were eased, </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4781030-stellantis-q1-shipments-and-revenues-suggest-more-pain-is-coming-downgrade-hold\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">the company wasn't able to accept a volume over value</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> strategy and kept focusing on margins. The result was a bloodbath, especially in the U.S., where </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GM\" title=\"General Motors Company\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">GM</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">'s strategy proved</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/luca-socci/analysis?ticker=GM\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> more resilient</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> amid different market conditions and is now paying off as General Motors is not offering big discounts as most of its peers because it has well-positioned its models in the right price tiers.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the end, I exited the stock more or less flat, with only the hefty dividends received as the true gains (a 25% yield, more or less). This taught me a lesson: the investment in Stellantis was reasonable, but it had to be timed better. This made me understand that Stellantis wasn't the best fit for my portfolio, since I try to hold predictable companies. I thus reinvested the capital into better plays, such as Prysmian (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PRYMF\" title=\"Prysmian S.p.A.\">OTCPK:PRYMF</a>) and Ferrari (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RACE\" title=\"Ferrari N.V.\">RACE</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, last week we saw both GM and Ford (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/F\" title=\"Ford Motor Company\">F</a>) reporting strong results; the market reacted and sent both <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830740-earnings-preview-who-will-do-better-between-ford-and-gm-my-money-is-on-gm\">stocks up double-digits</a>. We heard about recovering industry volumes and indeed some expectations about Stellantis mounted as we waited for the company to publish its sales release (Stellantis is headquartered in the Netherlands and, therefore, issues its results semiannually, reporting only its sales in Q1 and Q3 of each fiscal year). But as soon as Stellantis reported its Q3 sales, the stock slumped and went down 9%. What is going on?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First of all, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285625-stellantis-reports-13-percent-year-over-year-increase-in-q3-2025-shipments-and-net-revenues#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">Stellantis reported a 13% YoY increase</a> both in shipments (1.3M) and revenues (EUR 37.2B). This ends the brutal streak of 7 consecutive quarters of sequential declines. Moreover, Stellantis reported that its market share in the U.S. grew by around 40 bps, which is another positive signal. A couple of years ago, Stellantis held a market share above 10%. Right now, it is down to 7.4%. Since North America is Stellantis' most profitable market, it is undoubtedly good news that the company was finally able to gain a bit of market share. This happened thanks to the strong sales of the new Jeep and Ram models, with Q4 expected to perform even better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When we look at the net revenues and shipments breakdown by region, we see that North America's deliveries increased by 35% to 403k units, and net revenues were up 29% to EUR 16B. Europe saw its shipments increase by 8% to 534k units, with revenues increasing 4% to EUR 13B. South America, which has historically been a very successful end market for Stellantis, reported a 3% decline in shipments to 252k units, with revenues down even more (-5%) to EUR 4 B. However, the Middle East and Africa continued performing well, with shipments up 21% YoY to 94k and net revenues up by 9% to EUR 2.1B.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1020\" data-height=\"468\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"STLA Q3 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"294\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53230627-17618528112973752_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>STLA Q3 Sales Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835433-stellantis-n-v-stla-q3-2025-sales-call-transcript\">sales call, </a>the new CEO, Antonio Filosa, explained that Europe didn't perform as well as expected, with a market share loss of 70 bps. In fact, the French and Italian markets were softer than previously anticipated, and the LCV business also lost some traction. As a reminder, LCVs represent Stellantis' most profitable segment and generate around a third of total revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, the question remains. Why did Stellantis lose a tenth of its market cap after this sales release?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, the main reason comes from a contextual announcement that Stellantis made, stating that it has committed to its largest single investment program ever, which will make it deploy $13B in the U.S. over the next 4 years. By doing so, Stellantis aims to produce around 50% of its U.S. sales directly in the U.S.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why is this so concerning? Well, first and foremost, until two years ago, Stellantis was swimming in cash and had around EUR 45B parked in cash, making it one of the few automakers with a positive net cash position, even when including financial debt. The last year of Carlos Tavares' tenure brought along the surprise no one expected. A month or so after having reassured investors that the company would be fine in 2024, Stellantis released a profit warning and said it would end the year burning around EUR 10B in cash. This is why we now see that Stellantis' cash balance was EUR 32.4B at the end of 2024 and is now around EUR 29B. During the sales release, Stellantis only said that in the second half, it will improve its FCF generation versus the first half of the year, which ended with EUR -3B. So, I think what Stellantis meant by saying it will improve its result is that it won't be FCF positive, but that it will lose less. Let's say it will burn EUR 1.5B. We have a cash position that could be sitting at EUR 27B. When we subtract the large investment that was announced, we see that each year, Stellantis will use at least EUR 3.25B. Moreover, when such a large industrial plan is announced, we can expect that the largest part of this capital will be deployed in the early stages, thus severely impacting the next two fiscal years. In the meantime, Stellantis has become a net debt-positive company, thus eliminating one of the reasons why many of us considered it a steal just a few years ago. Now, although the company is back to a share price below $10, its fundamentals have changed. Right now, Stellantis is burning cash. Secondly, it has lost meaningful market share in its most profitable market. Third, its margins have come down from 12% to 4%-5%. Of course, the stock is being re-rated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While from a top-line revival perspective, this sales report could be considered encouraging, cash flow generation is still to be recovered. Therefore, the investment thesis can solely rely right now on considering Stellantis a turnaround play and not a fundamentally undervalued company. After all, the plunge in earnings will likely make Stellantis report negative EPS this year, which means that the PE ratio doesn't make sense anymore. Right now, the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STLA/valuation/metrics\">fwd PE sits at 24.2</a>, but it must be taken with a grain of salt. I would rather use the EV/EBITDA ratio: the TTM is 16.8, while the fwd is 3.7. This is a big difference and it shows how compressed Stellantis' EBITDA has been in the past 4 quarters. At the same time, many believe it will come back to more normal levels of around ERU 10B. We will have to wait one more quarter before we see some financial numbers, but we should not be so unrealistic as to expect the company to be back to EUR 20B in EBITDA soon. Considering that its cash position will decrease, we will have an EV that goes up, meaning that the ratio could expand as a result of the change in the capital structure of the company.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">No matter how I twist it, and as much as I don't like what I am saying since I wish Stellantis would achieve success, I don't see any room to step back in the stock. As a turnaround play, the tide is still highly uncertain, and the stock resembles more of a value trap rather than an undervalued opportunity. Right now, among the Detroit Big Three, I continue saying that my preference goes to GM. As for Stellantis, I confirm my sell rating.</p>",

The pullback from greenback's best level has been shallow. The US struck several<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> trade deals this week and secured a trade truce with China, even if many are skeptical of its longevity, and the Federal Reserve pushed against a December cut, and the futures market has reduced the odds to about 2/3rd from near certainty. Emerging market currencies are mixed, but this week's highlights include the PBOC setting the dollar's fix at a new low since October on Wednesday before steadying it in the last two sessions, and the (3.6%) recovery of the Argentine peso following last Sunday's election.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Nikkei (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NKY:IND\" title=\"NIKKEI 225 Index\">NKY:IND</a>) extended its weekly advance today. The 2.1% gain today brings the weekly rise to 6.3%. Most of the other large equity markets in the region but South Korea's Kospi (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KOSPI\" title=\"KOSPI Index\">KOSPI</a>) weakened today. Yet, the MSCI Asia Pacific index is closing higher on the week and is securing its seventh consecutive monthly advance. Europe's STOXX 600 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STOXX\" title=\"STOXX Europe 600 Index\">STOXX</a>) is weaker for the fourth consecutive session, which matches its longest decline since June. Still, it is poised to settle higher for the fourth consecutive month. Helped by Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) and Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), US index futures are trading higher today. The S&amp;P 500 (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Futures\">SPX</a></span>) and Nasdaq (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NDX\" title=\"NASDAQ 100-Index\">NDX</a>) will settle higher for the sixth and seventh consecutive months, respectively. European and US 10-year benchmark yields are slightly firmer today. Near 4.10%, the 10-year US Treasury yield (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y\" class=\"ticker-link\">US10Y</a>) is up around 12 bp this week, the most among the G10 countries. Gold is trading heavier, and barring a significant recovery, will settle lower in back-to-back weeks for the first time since July. December WTI is hovering near $60 and is off about 2% this week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>USD: </strong>A combination of the hawkish cut by the Fed and what appears to be an important de-escalation of US-China trade tensions (with some hope it can last a year) helped lift the Dollar Index to a new high for the month, near 99.70. Since the high was recorded in early North American turnover yesterday, DXY has remained above 99.40. Today's consolidation, near yesterday's high, looks constructive, and the next target is the 100.00-100.25 area. October is the second month of the year that DXY has risen and, more broadly, the dollar appreciated against all the G10 currencies. The Dollar Index has risen by around 2% this month despite lower yields, the government shutdown and the anticipation and delivery of the Federal Reserve's second rate cut of the year. The greenback's gains seemed to be a function of market positioning, optimism that the elevated Washington-Beijing tensions were part positioning ahead of new negotiations, and poor developments in Europe and Japan. While the House of Representatives remains out of session, the Senate has symbolically moved this week to check tariffs on Brazil, to end the \"emergency\" that has been used to justify many tariffs and to make SNAP contingency funds available. Yet, without the House's approval, these are symbolic measures but show dissent among some Republican senators.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Euro:</strong> The euro held above $1.1600 in the European morning yesterday, but the entry of North American players saw it sold to about $1.1545, a few hundredths of a cent above the month's low. It is holding today, but the single currency has barely traded above previous support near $1.1575. A break of the $1.1540 area leaves little on the charts ahead of the late July/early August lows near $1.1400. A move back above $1.16 would help stabilize the technical tone. The US two-year premium over Germany is around 162 bp, the highest since early September. The ECB's decision to stand pat yesterday and comments from President Lagarde suggesting the bar to another cut is high takes the thunder away from today's preliminary October CPI. It rose 0.2% in the month, but due to the base effect, the year-over-year rate slipped to 2.1% from 2.2%. The core rate was steady at 2.4%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>CNY:</strong> The dollar rose by about 0.25% against the offshore yuan yesterday, its largest single-day advance this month. It reached almost CNH7.1180, and this is holding today. The halfway mark of this year's range is around CNH7.1210. Above there, resistance is seen in the CNH7.1280-7.1300 area. Apparently, the foreign exchange market was not a subject of US-China negotiations. The PBOC set the dollar's fix at CNY7.0880 (CNY7.0864 yesterday and CNY7.0928 a week ago). It is the first back-to-back increase in the dollar's reference rate this month. China's October PMI softened. The manufacturing PMI eased to 49.0 from 49.8. It has been below the 50 boom/bust mark since April. The non-manufacturing PMI has held up better. Although it has not been below 50 this year, it has not been above 50.5 since May. It ticked up to 50.1 from 50.0, the low for the year. The composite eased to 50.0, which is the lowest it has been since the end of 2022 (50.6 in September). It averaged 50.4 in Q2 and Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>JPY:</strong> The backing up of US interest rates, despite or because of the Fed's cut Wednesday, and the BOJ's seeming lack of urgency to raise rates yesterday weighed on the yen. The dollar, which finished last week near JPY152.85, rose to nearly JPY154.45 yesterday, which is the lower end of a resistance band that extends to JPY155. Its consolidation today (between ~JPY153.65 and JPY154.40) looks bullish. The dollar's low for the year was recorded in April a little below JPY140. The high for the year was seen in January, almost JPY159. Today's data may help inform the BOJ's next rate decision. The economy recovered in September from a weak August, and core Tokyo CPI likely signals the direction of the national reading due in a few weeks. The headline and core measures rose from 2.5% to 2.8%. The September jobless rate was steady at 2.6%, while retail sales rose 0.3% after a revised 0.9% decline in August (initially -1.1%) and industrial output rose 2.2% (-1.5% in August). The swaps market has about a 46% chance of a hike in December, down slightly from the end of last week. On the contrary, we suspect the odds have crept up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>GBP:</strong> Sterling has had a tough week, though the economic diary was light. It was sold to a six-month low yesterday, slightly above $1.3115. Although it stabilized and recovered back above the $1.3140 area that held in May and August, the technical tone has deteriorated, and it remains below the 200-day moving average (~$1.3245) for the first time since April. It has held above yesterday's lows today but has been unable to rise above the $1.3165 area. A weekly close below $1.3140 would leave it in a vulnerable position. The main feature next week is the central bank meeting. The swaps market has around 25% chance of a cut. It was less than 10% at the end of last month. One large US investment bank forecasts a BOE cut and is one of the two of 16 economists surveyed by Bloomberg that anticipate a cut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>CAD:</strong> After the Bank of Canada cut rates on Wednesday, the US dollar extended its pullback against the Canadian dollar, falling to its lowest level in more than a month, slightly below CAD1.3890. The greenback's surge after the hawkish cut by the Fed lifted it back to around CAD1.3950, and the follow-through action yesterday saw it near CAD1.4015. This met the (61.8%) retracement of the US dollar's retreat from the six-month high recorded on October 14 near CAD1.4080. It is trading quietly (~CAD1.3980-1.4010) but firmly in the upper end of yesterday's range. StatCan is expected to shortly report that the economy stagnated in August after growing 0.2% in July. The monthly GDP has not risen for two consecutive months since September-October 2024. The Bank of Canada delivered its fourth rate cut of the year on Wednesday, and the official comments confirm what the market already suspected: the bar to another cut is high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>AUD:</strong> The Australian dollar rallied from around $0.6445 on October 17 to about $0.6615 before the Federal Reserve's rate cut on October 29. Yesterday, it was sold to almost $0.6530 to meet the (50%) retracement of the rally. While yesterday's low is holding, the Aussie has barely traded to $0.6560. A break of $0.6530 can spur a move toward $0.6500. The elevated CPI reading on Wednesday is understood as practically ruling out a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia next week. Today's Q3 PPI does not change that calculus. It rose 1.0% (0.7% in Q2), and the year-over-year rate edged up to 3.5% (from 3.4% in Q2).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>MXN:</strong> The dollar broke out of the narrow consolidative range to the upside and briefly traded above MXN18.60 yesterday for the first time in two and a half weeks. The high for the month set on October 10 was a little below MXN18.64, while the high from October 14 was slightly below MXN18.63. The dollar is holding above MXN18.50 today. It has not spent an entire session above there since September 10. The 0.3% contraction in Q3 GDP that Mexico reported yesterday reinforces speculation that Banxico will cut rates next week to 7.25% from 7.50%. It will be the seventh rate cut this year for a cumulative reduction of 275 bp. In 2024, the central bank cut 125 bp. Brazil's central bank also meets next week. It is expected to keep the Selic rate at 15.00%, where it has been since June. The US dollar recovered from BRL5.3345 on Wednesday and approached the week's high and the 20-day moving average near BRL5.3950 yesterday. The next area of resistance is around BRL5.4050-5.4300. Coming into today, the US dollar has fallen by about 3.5% against the Argentine peso since this week, since Milei's party did better than expected in the election. The 10-year dollar bond yield has fallen by almost 25 bp this week. Although the US Treasury has declared victory, for many market participants the jury is still out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.marctomarket.com/2025/10/bullish-dollar-consolidation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU\" title=\"DocuSign, Inc.\">DOCU</a></span>) experienced a major boom during the pandemic, unsurprisingly. However, as the world returned to normalcy, the stock has essentially erased all those gains. Early this year, I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4756902-docusign-stock-dont-sign-me-up\">initiated the stock</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> at a sell rating, citing weak fundamentals and overvaluation. Since that article, DocuSign has plunged ~23%, so my bearish view has played out. The company reported earnings back in September but won't report again until December, and I believe this is a good time to take another look at their results.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the below analysis, few signs of a turnaround are found. Top line growth remains sluggish, and billings guidance was uninspiring. Profitability also seems to be under pressure as both gross and operating margins contract, so despite the introduction of AI tools into their solutions, not much is going right for the company at this point. That said, the forward P/E ratio has contracted to a justified level, so I have decided to upgrade DocuSign to a hold rating on the basis of valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"652\" data-height=\"236\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Rating History\" width=\"640\" height=\"232\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"232\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617635914058225_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Too Many Customers?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"881\" data-height=\"529\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Overview\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"384\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617642205906882_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DocuSign Q2 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Is it possible to have too many users or customers?

While that is still a satisfactory growth rate, as you can see above, revenue growth has been very sluggish since late calendar 2023. There is some rebound in growth from the previous quarter, but overall, it may be too early to conclude that an inflection point is in. Still, they were able to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/earnings\">beat analysts' expectations</a> by $20.05 million, so results are better than feared. Looking at their subscription revenues specifically, there has also been recent sluggishness with growth at just 9% as well. Therefore, there hasn't been enough acceleration to show that growth is truly headed in the right direction. Their billings do show some better signs, however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1082\" data-height=\"677\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Billings\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"400\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617656101039422_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DocuSign Q2 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While revenues aren't showing many signs of improving business activity, the company's billings show that the worst may be over.

Also note that the rolling four-quarter YoY growth rate has ticked up notably to 9%.

For gross margin there was notable contraction, especially for their core subscription business. For subscriptions, gross margin contracted by 40 basis points, while the company as a whole saw a contraction of 20 basis points. This could indicate that cost control hasn't been great, but it also may show that clients aren't opting for their higher-margin products. That client behavior could be a concern moving forward.

While I see no problem with the increase in R&amp;D spending as a percentage of revenues, the increases in sales &amp; marketing and general &amp; administrative expenses are clearly undesirable. S&amp;M expenses as a percentage of revenues increased by 80 basis points YoY, while G&amp;A expenses increased 90 basis points to 7.9% of revenues. These are clear signs that corporate efficiency has not been favorable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result of contracting margins, DocuSign reported an adjusted EPS of $0.92, representing a decline of 5.15% YoY. A bottom-line decline is, of course, not a great sign. Still, they managed to beat analyst estimates by $0.07, so expectations were very low to begin with. Currently, it seems that DocuSign is dealing with problems on two fronts. Top line growth remains sluggish, and profitability is also not headed in the right direction.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Guidance Raised</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1342\" data-height=\"499\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Guidance\" width=\"640\" height=\"238\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"238\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/57947294-17617671902625766_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DocuSign Q2 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite what I would call lackluster Q2 results, DocuSign was still able to deliver a beat and raise. All of the above FY2026 guidance figures have been <a href=\"https://investor.docusign.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Docusign-Announces-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026-Financial-Results-Announces-1-0-Billion-Increase-to-Share-Repurchase-Program/\" rel=\"nofollow\">updated favorably,</a> and that is, of course, welcome news for investors. The company is now expecting revenue growth to be at about 7%. That is a slowdown from <a href=\"https://investor.docusign.com/investors/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Docusign-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2025-Financial-Results/\" rel=\"nofollow\">FY2025's 8% increase,</a> and so again, the top line isn't showing signs of a re-acceleration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For subscription revenues in particular, the projected 8% increase would be unchanged from FY2025, so at least for their core business, things are shaping up to be steady. That's also the case for billings. Their 7% growth projection would also be unchanged from the previous year. However, recall that Billings growth was 13% in Q2. Therefore, the acceleration we saw may not continue for FY2026 as a whole, and that makes the demand outlook shaky once again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for their margins, the above ranges for both gross margin and operating margin are below what we saw in FY2025, so the efficiency and profitability woes we discussed above are also happening in the annual timeframe. Overall, while a raising of guidance is surely welcomed, I believe these updated figures still don't provide much promise that the company has hit an inflection point.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Likely Fair</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_4244839417614f049fc444831ab4fcfe.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During this year, DocuSign's forward P/E ratio has continued to trend down. At a current reading of 18.76, the multiple is essentially at one year lows. I believe the valuation correctly reflects the fundamentals right now. Today, we have learned quite a bit about the company. Revenues remain sluggish, and while Q2 billings were quite strong, full year guidance for billings shows that demand remains subdued. Profitability is also under pressure, and if they don't improve their corporate efficiency, the bottom line will pay the price. As stated just above, guidance was raised, but the new figures still don't show that a meaningful turnaround is happening. With that being the case, I find the valuation contraction this year to be unsurprising and justified. Currently, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOCU/valuation/metrics\">Seeking Alpha shows</a> that DocuSign trades at around a 25% discount to the IT sector according to the non-GAAP forward P/E ratio. Given the struggles the company finds itself in, I would say that this valuation gap is an appropriate reflection of reality.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DocuSign has been under pressure ever since the pandemic was over, and from today's analysis, it seems the company will continue to experience sluggishness moving forward. As stated above, demand doesn't seem to be overly robust right now despite their expanded solutions portfolio. Furthermore, margin contraction is dragging down their profitability. While normally a beat and raise is a great sign, the updated guidance is still rather lackluster in my view. That said, the forward P/E ratio has come down quite a bit from earlier this year, and since the valuation is now justified, I have decided to upgrade to a neutral rating of hold.</p>",
