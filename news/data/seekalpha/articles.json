The key point of attention going forward will be whether declining occupancy begins to spill over into lower leasing spreads.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management Commentary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Turning to the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834921-industrial-logistics-properties-trust-ilpt-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834921-industrial-logistics-properties-trust-ilpt-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">conference call</a>, the company is looking to cut debt by selling three properties for about $55 million, with closing expected in Q4 2025/early 2026. The largest property, set to be sold for about $50 million, is expected to fetch a premium valuation since the buyer will be the end user of the property (owner-buyer transaction). As such, the cap rate in this specific property may be below 6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Normalized FFO for Q4 2025 is expected to be between $0.27 and $0.29 per share, or up 7.6% Q/Q at the midpoint. Interest costs are fully hedged, hence interest expense will be flat Q/Q, with ILPT seeing no benefit from ongoing Fed rate cuts. As such, I think that the key driver of normalized FFO growth should be future NOI increases thanks to robust leasing spreads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net absorption is expected at 3 million square feet over the medium term, which would be quite significant since the company has 59 million in total rentable square feet. As such, my understanding is that the decline in occupancy observed so far in 2025 should reverse over the next few years. Indeed, my calculations show that net absorption of 3 million square feet would result in occupancy reaching as high as 99%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">ILPT Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4812590-industrial-logistics-properties-trust-turnaround-in-progress\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4812590-industrial-logistics-properties-trust-turnaround-in-progress\" target=\"_blank\">previous analysis of ILPT</a>, I estimated a normalized FFO run-rate of about $1.00/share over the next year. Given the ongoing NOI growth and expectations for a rebound in occupancy, odds are that ILPT will marginally exceed that, with my calculations showing that normalized FFO should continue to grow by $0.01-$0.02 per share, per quarter, thanks to NOI growth alone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, my estimate for 2026 normalized FFO would be $1.15-$1.23 per share. Taking the midpoint of $1.19/share, we observe that ILPT remains one of the cheapest commercial REITs, commanding an FFO multiple of just 4.4x relative to my 2026 normalized FFO outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, we need to consider the extreme amount of leverage used by ILPT, at about 86% of enterprise value. To account for this, we need to look at enterprise-level cash flows, which I estimate at about $333 million ($79 million in 2026 normalized FFO and $254 million in debt expenses). Relative to the $4.7 billion enterprise value, we observe that the market implied cap rate stands at about 7.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I should note that the 7.1% figure already incorporates management overhead, which I estimate at about $39 million currently. Hence, from an acquirer's perspective, we note that enterprise-level cash flows in 2026 should be marginally higher, at approximately $372 million. This would bring the market implied cap rate up to 7.9%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Either way, for a company growing marginally above the pace of inflation, I view the 7.1-7.9% market-implied cap rate as quite attractive. As such, I confirm my previous Buy rating on ILPT.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The principal risk in the investment case is ILPT's very high leverage, at about 86% of enterprise value. This silver lining is that recent debt refinancing at lower interest rates, coupled with ongoing NOI growth, has improved the interest expense coverage by adjusted EBITDAre to 1.3x from 1.1x at the end of 2024:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/44733396-17618997396283314_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1384\" data-height=\"327\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/44733396-17618997396283314_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Leverage and coverage ratios\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"151\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/44733396-17618997396283314_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/44733396-17618997396283314_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/44733396-17618997396283314_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/44733396-17618997396283314_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/44733396-17618997396283314_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/44733396-17618997396283314_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/44733396-17618997396283314_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/44733396-17618997396283314_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Leverage and coverage ratios <span>(Industrial Logistics Properties Trust Q3 2025 supplemental)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going forward, I expect significant retained earnings (the quarterly dividend stands at only $0.05/share, or a payout ratio of 0.17x relative to my $1.19/share 2026 normalized FFO outlook) and ongoing NOI growth to continue to improve interest coverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other key risk to consider is a recession in the United States. This would reduce demand for industrial properties, likely causing a continuation of recent occupancy declines, and dashing optimistic management expectations for net absorption. In my 2026 forecast, I have not penciled in normalized FFO growth from occupancy gains, hence, this risk is mitigated to an extent.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Industrial Logistics Properties Trust has been one of the best-performing REITs so far in 2025, benefiting from a mix of lower interest expenses and ongoing NOI growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead to 2026, I expect the strong performance to continue as the company remains cheap on both a normalized FFO multiple/enterprise-level basis, notwithstanding its elevated leverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I confirm my previous Buy rating on ILPT and expect the REIT to deliver normalized FFO of about $1.15-$1.23 per share next year, with the potential for an even higher result if the company manages to turn around recent declines in occupancy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other than high debt, a potential recession in the United States is a key risk in the investment case.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thank you for reading.</p>",

I am committed to the long-term thesis with Tesla, as I view the company as integral to Western revitalization in the autonomy age (and hence a very good investment due to the thematic trends). My last thesis explored Musk's insider buying activity, which boosted the market's sentiment on the company. Now, there's a newly proposed </span><a href=\"https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000110465925087598/tm252289-4_pre14a-gen.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">$1T potential pay package</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> contingent on operational milestones.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I view Elon Musk's potential pay package as an integral part of aligning the company's CEO with necessary incentives to increase the likelihood of operational success, with important equity stewardship and reasonable control for stronger internal decision-making. This is the basis of the writeup you are now reading and the framework for why I continue to be bullish on TSLA and hold the stock at ~4% of NAV.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Incentivizing Execution to Match Vision</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tesla is proposing a <a href=\"https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000110465925087598/tm252289-4_pre14a-gen.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">12-tranche performance award</a> using restricted common stock. The total pool is 423,743,904 shares, and these are split equally into 12 tranches of 35,311,992 shares each. For these tranches to be unlocked, a market-cap milestone has to be achieved (the 12 steps are $2T—$8.5T), and there have to be corresponding operational/fundamental milestones achieved (i.e., the vesting cannot be the consequence of speculation, which grounds the thesis in reality (hard to imagine for Musk's visionary leadership style, but very necessary for Tesla given its premium valuation)).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://ir.tesla.com/_flysystem/s3/sec/000110465925087598/tm252289-4_pre14a-gen.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">The milestones</a> are 20M aggregate vehicles; 10M FSD subs; 1M robotaxis; 1M robots; or eight specified Adjusted EBITDA tiers from $50B to $400B measured over the last four consecutive quarters. More specifically, the last three EBITDA milestones are $400B each and must be achieved in three non-overlapping four-quarter periods. Market-cap tests will use both 30-day and 6-month averages.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://www.mccarter.com/insights/delaware-court-of-chancery-rejects-elon-musks55-8b-tesla-compensation-package-again/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Delaware Chancery Court</a> rescinded the 2018 $55.8B award in Tornetta v. Musk due to transaction-specific control and disclosure defects; follow-on orders addressed rescission mechanics and fees, but Tesla has now <a href=\"https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/tesla-reincorporation-texas-delaware-musk-shareholders/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reincorporated in Texas</a>, and the new pay package will be addressed under Texas corporate law going forward. This should reduce friction, but proxy advisors ISS and Glass Lewis <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/proxy-firm-glass-lewis-joins-iss-urging-vote-against-musks-1-trillion-pay-2025-10-20/\" rel=\"nofollow\">recommend AGAINST</a> the ~$1T-headline plan, not that that's going to stop it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The \"reasonable\" outlook on this proposal is that it has a low probability of full realization within the award window, but then again, what in Tesla's history has been reasonable? None of it, and yet it has achieved essentially all of what it set out to do to date. Even with failures along the way, the lesson of Musk is this: if you believe, you <em>never</em> <em>give up</em>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We need to put into perspective what it is we are looking at here fundamentally so we can gain perspective on the valuation and the scope of the deal. I think it is important to understand from the outset that Tesla is trading beyond any reasonable doubt in \"ultra-premium territory.\" The valuation is completely detached from the sector and the market as a whole. Bear in mind that I still own it at 4% of NAV, but there is much less intrinsic value in the stock than one would hope unless Musk executes on his vision with precision.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tesla's forward PEG non-GAAP ratio is currently 12.71, while the sector's is 1.66. This is a proper representation that either the analysts' consensus perspective on the company's growth is heavily inaccurate (in fact, in the short term, it is not inaccurate because the timing of autonomy at scale is not 12 months—in fact, headwinds could persist in that timeframe), or that the market is properly pricing long-term growth well in advance. Even then, I reluctantly use the word \"properly,\" because the growth rates are not being valued efficiently by the market but are instead being granted an \"ultra premium\" based on perceived moat and celebrity factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We should quickly and cleanly compare this to Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>), which has a forward PEG non-GAAP ratio of 1.28, which is almost 30% below its information technology sector median. So with Nvidia, you are getting undervaluation based on reliable near-term growth. With Tesla, you are getting overvaluation based on visionary long-term growth. The risk profiles are completely different. Tesla is high-risk, but its return history is almost mystical in spite of this. Whatever Musk is doing, it's working (operationally, which is all that counts). That is, there is a thriving underlying business here with a strong pivot strategy; there is no \"bubble\" in Tesla, the market just loves Tesla stock, or maybe they love Musk (or love to hate him, or hate him and buy Tesla stock anyway, who knows).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's very difficult to value and price forecast Tesla based on its fundamentals due to its unique position in market psychology. That is why I always refer to the technicals when considering my allocation framework for Tesla stock:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58583751-1761848449291924_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1633\" data-height=\"1316\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58583751-1761848449291924_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TSLA One-Week-Intervals Price Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"516\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58583751-1761848449291924_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58583751-1761848449291924_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58583751-1761848449291924_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58583751-1761848449291924_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58583751-1761848449291924_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58583751-1761848449291924_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58583751-1761848449291924_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58583751-1761848449291924_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">TSLA One-Week-Intervals Price Chart <span>(Author's Chart)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the trajectory of Tesla as being focused on upward margin mobility in the long term and it having an autonomy-based growth thesis already being executed on, the risk of extended downside volatility is low. That said, near-term moderate volatility is likely with quarterly operational hurdles and resistance. The price is above the 50-week MA quite considerably right now, so sentiment is \"elevated,\" but we can also see that the 50-day MA recently crossed the 200-day MA in early 2025, so we are experiencing a long-term uptrend now, and I don't expect this to end anytime soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That is why I posit that holding through any near-term volatility and aligning capital with Musk's long-term vision is wise. This might not be an \"elite\" entry point (that was back in mid-to-late 2024), but it's a good one if you can ignore short-term price noise and focus on what counts: your long-term annual return.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are obvious risks with an investment in Tesla that are amplified by the ultra-premium valuation, but in general I do not consider them to be anything to be afraid of. Put simply, one has to believe in Musk to be an investor in Tesla; if you can accept that, you will likely see the resiliency of the return horizon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Detractors point to quarterly instability and use peer analysis and fundamental valuation calculations to convince themselves that the market is wrong, but the market is not wrong; they are.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The greatest risk I see is key-man risk; that is, Musk, for some reason, is no longer available as CEO. Bar this, the odds are stacked in Musk's favor, precisely because he breaks the odds. Part of that is intellectual genius, and another part is a wartime will—the \"never finished\" mindset—until victory, but only God knows when that time will come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, in the near term, there are some factors that could introduce volatility, even if the long-term success looks \"inevitable\" to me. Proxy advisers influence <a href=\"https://financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=409707&amp;\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">roughly 20–30%</a> of institutional votes, and so the ISS and Glass Lewis AGAINST recommendations signal a perception (which could increase) of reputational/governance risk. Passive and quant desks often reduce or hedge exposure to stocks facing contentious proxy votes to dampen event volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This perception sensitivity coincides with a drag on the valuation premium if Musk loses more socio-political favor, though I find that unlikely given that it is a diminishing left-leaning populace which are his detractors, while the supportive factions appear to be garnering the popular vote (indeed, we saw this play out in the Trump 2.0 election and playing out with the rise of <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-uk/reform-uk-leads-12-pts-over-labour-both-pm-and-chancellor-hit-historic-low-satisfaction-ratings\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reform in the UK</a>).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Buy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Musk's life is one full of sacrifices, and sacrifices I, personally, would not make. Yet, his role in society is clearly not one of selfishness, but instead a modus operandi of service to macro (I can't stress the word macro enough here) human flourishing and meritocracy. It is this ethos that I associate with Tesla's past successes and the high probability of its future victory. The stock might be expensive, but it reflects the value of a remarkable operating model, including Musk's psychology leading an elite team of engineers and a full-stack corporate force.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the current elevated price compared to MAs and the reality of operational repositioning amid the autonomy pivot, a conservative base-case stock price estimate is $500 in 12 months' time, but this is only the beginning and negligible in light of what's ahead. Exciting times, indeed.</p>",

However, this doesn’t mean the past will keep repeating itself, creating an opportunity for some sector stocks to rotate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is where Privia Health Group, Inc. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PRVA\" title=\"Privia Health Group, Inc.\">PRVA</a></span>) comes into play: a fee-for-service physician enablement company with sufficient growth to warrant the premiums assigned to it. With a steady stream of recurring revenue and a moat around its relationships with various medical practices, this stock combines the safety of healthcare with a high-growth profile, which should be priced into its valuation over the coming months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With implemented providers being a key driver in Privia Health's business platform, further growth in users can deliver on both revenue growth and economies of scale to spread costs as a boost to operating margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As will be pointed out, an expansion in the company's footprint in the United States market will carry out these positive effects moving forward, creating upside potential not yet priced into the stock today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Right now, the stock trades at a triple top, as the chart suggests. However, chances are $26.00 will mark a breakout ahead of its following quarterly earnings results, to be announced on November 6th, 2025. While a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation model doesn’t reflect much upside under conservative assumptions, recent developments may warrant a revision and a more favorable exit case.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Recent Events Create High Expectations For Privia Health's Quarter</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A September 23rd, 2025, press release points to <a href=\"https://ir.priviahealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/privia-health-expands-value-based-care-footprint-acquisition\" rel=\"nofollow\">Privia Health’s acquisition</a> of Accountable Care Organization (ACO) from Evolent Health Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EVH\" title=\"Evolent Health, Inc.\">EVH</a>). This addition to the portfolio allows Privia Health to tap into over 120,000 new users, expanding this revenue stream and post-acquisition growth trajectories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, the financial effects will be clearer on the upcoming earnings call, though market expectations are high. With a forward P/E ratio of 78.8x today, above all the mentioned comparables (discussed later), Privia Health’s earnings per share (EPS) growth is likely to beat the current consensus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1402\" data-height=\"692\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Historical and forecasted income statement figures\" width=\"640\" height=\"316\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/25/52925648-17614144370177307_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Privia Health income statement <span>(TIKR.com )</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given sustained conservative revenue growth into FY’27, appropriate margins, and tax assumptions, it is still somewhat unclear where analysts are getting the $1.17 EPS figure for their forecast.

Assuming a 10% conversion from broad care into VBC (or 3.4 million people), the additional revenue on top of the ACO projected benefits can make this $17.43 DCF valuation seem conservative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this 10% conversion rate from broad care into VBC, some assumptions can be made using the <a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/oact/tr/2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">2025 Medicaid trustees payout data</a> reported:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">- $9,400 average spent per year per user.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">- Under normal Privia Health platform fees of 1.3%, this shift into VBC could represent (1.3% * $9,400) = $120/yr in revenue per user.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Keeping this in line with the 3.4 million new users coming into VBC after these Medicaid cuts, investors can arrive at $120/yr in revenue per user * 3.4 million users for a net revenue addition of $408 million on a base case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is how that valuation range changes as these assumptions are added to forecasts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Privia Health's Premium Comes From The Revenue Side</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Spreading Privia Health next to comparables in the space, such as Hims &amp; Hers Health, Inc.

Under the Wall Street consensus for revenue in FY’25 of $2.1 billion, and a P/S multiple range of 2.25x to 2.66x, Privia should be able to trade up to $36.32 and $43.15 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking back at the<span> </span><a href=\"https://ir.priviahealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/privia-health-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">company’s 2Q’25 results</a>, a 23.4% annual revenue growth rate places it among the ranks of Hims &amp; Hers and other fast-growing companies in the space.

Additionally, with over 120,000 new customers and expansion into 11 additional states, the gross margin (and operating margin) figures have been boosted accordingly due to economies of scale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While these are the base numbers reported for ACO, the addition of new customers and over 1,000 physicians could open a new total addressable market for Privia Health, potentially surpassing the $10 million in additional EBITDA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The result is an EPS forecast that serves as a sanity check against the consensus numbers, pinpointing where the additional upside not yet priced into Privia Health stock comes from today, erasing some of the \"surprise\" factor as far as exogenous factors are concerned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With an updated income statement and DCF view, upside is found in Privia Health stock, while still leaving the chance of a stronger combined operation moving forward to overdeliver on these forecasts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2280\" data-height=\"1125\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Acquisition adjusted income statement model\" width=\"640\" height=\"316\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/52925648-17616834358875234_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Technical analysis breakdown for Privia Health, volatility and volume measures <span>(Investing.com data )</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the technical side, volatility measures have contracted to their lowest level in 2025, as indicated by average true ranges (ATRs), which coincide with a triple top pattern on the chart as of October 24th, 2025. A reasonable expectation is that volume and volatility remain tamed through the November 6th earnings release, after which a breakout in both metrics is likely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the last earnings release in August 2025, the stock’s ATR jumped to 7.2% from the latest reading of 1.5%. Previous earnings volatility has yielded similar ATR readings of 7% to 9%. Considering this behavioral range, an implied move to the upside, warranted by the stock’s premium, could send Privia Health to $28.33 per share, another significant resistance area set in the second and third quarters of 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All told, this price target does not fall far from the current Wall Street <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PRVA/ratings/sell-side-ratings\" rel=\"noopener\">consensus of $30.33 per share</a>, striking Privia Health right into that previous resistance area. Moreover, the lower end of a P/S valuation from the earlier comparables analysis ($36.32) also aligns with an August 2025 rating from JMP Securities, in which David M. Scharf set a $30 per share price target for the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chances are, if the premium on the stock is warranted in the upcoming earnings release, more analysts will have to adjust their assumptions and targets, closing the gap and justifying a higher price for the stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks To Privia Health's Breakout</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Buying a premium stock doesn't take risk away, and traders would be relying on a good quarter to be reported on November 6th, 2025, for this to play out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given how low EBIT margins are (1% to 2%), there is a thin margin of error; therefore, any miss on the top line could invalidate the optimistic outlooks Wall Street analysts have today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the recent acquisition from Evolent Health could support these assumptions and expectations, so the premium must be justified once the deal is closed and the new financial figures are incorporated into updated targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the technical side, traders are relying on a volume pick up for Privia Health to deliver on this breakout, given the $26.00 per share resistance level it faces today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is also a significant swing in additional revenue relying on the conversion from Medicaid broad care into VBC. Under this 10% conversion assumption, a factor that could not end up being realized and affect the terminal value of Privia Health stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">How the Administration chooses to undertake these benefit cuts will ultimately determine how these users react to this conversion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Should any of these fail to come in for the stock, then the risk premium increases ahead of the earnings announcement, and this entire thesis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the healthcare sector in itself showing a wide underperformance gap to the S&amp;P 500 index, the opportunities for price action (and valuation) rebounds abound.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Privia Health shows all the signs of a potential EPS swing to bolster its valuation case, some assumption risks do exist.

While some players are signaling resilience through revenue growth and strong StarMine model scores, analysts remain cautious on earnings surprises.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, retailers are leaning on aggressive discounting strategies to spur demand for costumes and décor. The discount penetration for costumes and accessories has surged to 83%, with average discounts at 36%, the highest since pre-pandemic levels, suggesting aggressive promotional strategies to drive demand.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Trick or treat</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consumers may be spooked by higher chocolate prices this Halloween as record cocoa costs continue to pressure margins. Rising input costs are likely to translate into higher prices for smaller-sized Halloween candy bars.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mondelez International (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDLZ\" title=\"Mondelez International, Inc.\">MDLZ</a>), with brands such as Sour Patch Kids and Cadbury, just beat third-quarter earnings and revenue estimates despite the impact of cocoa cost inflation. CEO Dirk Van de Put noted: “Although we anticipate challenging conditions to continue in some markets, we are encouraged by recent moderation in cocoa prices, as well as promising signs for a strong cocoa crop this fall.” (Source: Mondelez International Q3 2025 Earnings Release)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is on track to deliver 13.4% earnings growth and 8.2% revenue growth in Q4 2025, which includes the Halloween season (Exhibit 1).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Exhibit 1: Mondelez Revenue and Earnings Results/Estimates: 2019 – 2025</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_Picture1-2.png?io=w640\" contenteditable=\"false\" alt=\"\" width=\"1037\" height=\"122\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_Picture1-2.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_Picture1-2.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_Picture1-2.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_Picture1-2.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_Picture1-2.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_Picture1-2.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_Picture1-2.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_Picture1-2.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Source: LSEG I/B/E/S data</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, analysts surveyed by LSEG remain cautious.

Since then, Western Digital has effectively doubled, and when any stock rallies that fast, we have to take a fresh look with fresh eyes at whether it really has the capacity to rally higher. To me, high expectations are now baked into the stock, and high valuation multiples have slimmed down the possibility of further upward multiples re-rating, causing me to downgrade Western Digital to \"Neutral.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At current share prices, I see more of a balanced bull and bear case for the company. On the bright side for Western Digital:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Western Digital is seeing unprecedented levels of demand. Revenue growth continues to hang on to a ~30% y/y clip, and competitors like Micron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU\" title=\"Micron Technology, Inc.\">MU</a>) have indicated that supply for 2026 is largely already booked out.</li> <li>Gross margin levels continue to rise. In the past, storage and memory companies have had a problem similar to airlines: boom and bust cycles that led to price wars and negative margins. In this cycle, however, Western Digital has continued to strengthen its gross margins to the mid-40%s, indicating healthy ASPs and vibrant demand.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, however, we do have to be wary of several risks:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Storage is a commoditized business. The company has no shortage of competitors, ranging from other heavyweights like Micron and Seagate (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STX\" title=\"Seagate Technology Holdings plc\">STX</a>) to international conglomerates like Toshiba and Samsung.</li> <li>Capex may be frontloaded, and this level of demand may not be sustained forever. Companies, especially the tech giants, are racing now to build out AI infrastructure to support new applications, but this doesn't mean that this level of demand will last in the long run. In other words, Western Digital's boom times now may represent a revenue peak that will be difficult to comp.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What ultimately leaves me more ambivalent about Western Digital, however, is the fact that the stock is no longer cheap. It was a very appealing buy a mere few months ago when it was trading at a low-teens P/E multiple; today, the stock's 21x forward P/E multiple towers over Micron, despite similar growth rates and margin tailwinds in the latter.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_0fbf8bdd526cb86fc946bf90c4e5f7fd.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_0fbf8bdd526cb86fc946bf90c4e5f7fd.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_0fbf8bdd526cb86fc946bf90c4e5f7fd.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_0fbf8bdd526cb86fc946bf90c4e5f7fd.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_0fbf8bdd526cb86fc946bf90c4e5f7fd.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_0fbf8bdd526cb86fc946bf90c4e5f7fd.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_0fbf8bdd526cb86fc946bf90c4e5f7fd.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_0fbf8bdd526cb86fc946bf90c4e5f7fd.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_0fbf8bdd526cb86fc946bf90c4e5f7fd.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So while I continue to view Micron as an opportunistic buy, I think Western Digital is close to reaching the end of its rope.

Per CEO Tiang Yew Tan's remarks on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835925-western-digital-corporation-wdc-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835925-western-digital-corporation-wdc-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">Q1 earnings call</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>As a result, our customers are providing greater visibility into their long-term needs, which in turn strengthens our partnership and helps us to support their future growth requirements. Our top 7 customers have now provided purchase orders extending throughout the first half of calendar year 2026. And 5 of them have provided purchase orders covering all of calendar year 2026. I'm also pleased to share that 1 of our largest hyperscale customers has signed an agreement covering all of calendar year 2027.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These longer-term commitments give us reassurance that the current demand boom and strong margin profile will be durable, at least in the medium term. We do think, however, that investors should consider the potential fallout if companies start to pull back on capex, after intense pull-forwards of investment in 2025/2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, Western Digital's margins remained hot. The company doesn't report exact ASP, but on the Q&amp;A portion of the Q1 earnings call, CFO Kris Sennesael reported \"modest low single-digits ASP per terabyte increases\" which buoyed gross margins.

This comes ahead of a key meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later in the week. So what are the broader market implications? Joining me now is Phil Davis, founder of PhilStockWorld.com, from a beautiful, sunny location.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Phil, always great to have you here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Phil Davis:</strong> Hi, thanks, Kim. Very good to be here, thanks. Appreciate it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kim Parlee:</strong> Let's start things off, if we could, about the deal that's supposed to be en route, I will say, for the US and China. They talk about a substantial framework that's going to be in place. How optimistic are you about this?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Phil Davis:</strong> I'm less optimistic than the markets have been this week. We've seen the movie before. In January of 2020, in fact, Trump, he signed a deal with China that was supposed to be-- China was supposed to make $200 billion worth of purchases, and it took a long time, and it only worked out to 100 billion. And none of the major issues ever got resolved.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So we're right back here doing the same thing again. This year, it was 145% in April, 30% in May. Now it's 45. Now he might go to 100. We don't know what's going on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kim Parlee:</strong> So well, let me ask you then, is there anything you've heard in this latest round of talks that you think is substantial? What's actually been agreed to?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Phil Davis:</strong> Well, when you hear framework, the framework is a framework to discuss the trade deal. It's not the trade deal itself. There's no framework to the trade deal. This is a framework to have a meeting about the trade deal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a preliminary consensus, and Beijing says it's constructive, but there's no money being discussed, there's no timeline, there's no enforcement. And these are complicated things that take months to go over and fill out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just last week, they launched an investigation into whether China fulfilled any of the 2020 promises that they made. We've got major issues. We've got semiconductors, IP theft, the TikTok thing. None of that's resolved. This is a timeout at best.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kim Parlee:</strong> So let's talk about, then, the US and Canada. Even though you're not, I'll say, optimistic about the progression with the US and China, a lot of people are a lot less optimistic right now about US and Canada. And it's interesting to note, and Canada actually got in trouble for highlighting the downside for the States that could come out of a lack of a deal. But you want to double click on that and say that is an issue. It's not just bad for Canada, it's bad for the US.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Phil Davis:</strong> Oh, absolutely. But I mean, on behalf of sane Americans, I apologize for this idiocy. It was a very good commercial, by the way. The Canadian viewers should pay attention to this because the Bank of-- your Bank of Canada governor, Macklem, he laid it out. The tariffs have contradictory effects. They slow growth. They kill jobs. They push inflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They obviously raise the cost of imports, which pushes more inflation up. Canada is looking at a 5% hit if we stick with these tariffs. America 2%, maybe 2.5%, probably less of an effect. But it hurts both countries. It's ridiculous.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The US takes a hit, but what's really dangerous is that you break the supply chain, and those costs get passed through. You got auto parts, steel, aluminum. If you don't resolve it, you're looking at higher car prices, construction costs, both sides of the border, not just for Canada. And the Fed is trying to make policy not knowing what our trade policy is. That's insane also.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kim Parlee:</strong> Yeah, there's a lot happening. What are you watching in the upcoming week? I mean, there's a whole lot of things right now. We've got the Mag 7 reporting this week, and we've seen markets kind of key off some of that. And it's been pretty positive. You mentioned the lack of economic data that's coming out right now. What are you paying attention to?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Phil Davis:</strong> I mean our government is closed, so it's completely ridiculous that the Fed is making multi-trillion dollar decisions with absolutely no data. They're just guessing. I mean, they're just guessing at the best of times, but this is, like, blind and guessing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What my biggest concern is in this whole thing is, if you look at the Magnificent 7 and all of their outlook and their reporting and so on and so forth, they're all just paying each other. Everyone's got their hand in everybody else's pocket, and they're just passing the money back and forth between each other. But there's no actual money coming in from consumers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I mean, of course, there's billions of dollars coming in, but in reality, that's nowhere near enough for the $600 billion of infrastructure they're all promising to spend on each other. And it is literally on each other. Like NVIDIA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) invests $100 billion in OpenAI. And OpenAI promises to buy $100 billion worth of chips from NVIDIA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's the same freaking money, but it gets reported twice. That's the most dangerous thing that in the economy, and in the outlook, and in the market capitalizations, you're having all this double, triple, quadruple reporting of the same money between the same parties. That's dangerous.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kim Parlee:</strong> Yeah, I know you talk about it being a closed loop. And so these are just CapEx budgets getting recycled throughout the Mag 7. Can I play devil's advocate for a second, though, because when you have the startup of new industries, even if I think about railways when they first came across North America or when the Internet started, did you not have some of these closed loops in those places too? Is this just the latest version of?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Phil Davis:</strong> Oh, what a terrible example. I'm just watching The Gilded Age, which is a really good show on HBO. And the guys, they're doing the railroads back in the day in the 1900s, and it's the same problem. You've got to build massive, massive infrastructure. And everybody is racing to build essentially the same thing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's a track. It goes from one place to another, and you've got five guys building a track from Chicago to LA, but only not all of them will end up getting used. Most of the money ends up being wasted, and the system becomes so interdependent that if one goes down, they can all get pulled under. The banks can't sustain the damage when they fall apart.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's what we're doing now. We're basically building railroads, and it's the same thing as when we built the telecom infrastructure in the dotcom days. You remember MCI and Sprint and five other companies, I remember, that went out? Who was that? There was a really big one that went out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Anyway, they spent redundant billions. Back then a billion was a lot of money. They spent billions of dollars. Now it's like, now it's like, oops, I dropped a billion. Don't worry about it. It's an incredible system and it's going on right in front of us. Money is just being burned up on a daily basis. And it's not being replaced.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kim Parlee:</strong> Do you think-- Do you have an idea what's going to trigger something to change?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Phil Davis:</strong> I think the trigger-- I think there's not enough money in the world to justify spending $600 billion this year. Not this year, I think. I guess next year-- $600 billion next year of promised infrastructure spending. Everybody's reports, everybody's forward price/earnings and everything is based on the fact that they're anticipating the $600 billion to appear from somewhere.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And yes, NVIDIA sells a lot of chips, but how are these guys buying the chips? How are they going to spend this kind of money on it just to have a little bit smarter AI? It's a little bit ridiculous now that they're spending the money on incremental gains in AI. They're willing to spend $100 billion just to have, version 2.4 instead of 2.3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I mean, we're running out of ideas already. And the worst thing, here's the worst thing-- OpenAI has 500 million users per week, yet they only have 15 million paying customers. That means only 3% of the people who use OpenAI are willing to pay for it. That's not much money.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.moneytalkgo.com/video/billion-dollar-loop-is-big-tech-paying-itself-to-power-the-ai-boom/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p>",

It’s not too complicated to understand why - in today’s digital world, the traditional department store business model is, as widely believed, by and large, a fading one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the reason I’m still willing to move forward to research further— and not immediately call it a value trap — is because I remember a time, roughly three to four years ago, when <a href=\"https://abc7.com/post/kohls-possible-sale-stock-activist-investor-buyout-offer/11504663/\" rel=\"nofollow\">buyout funds were actively competing</a> to acquire Kohl's. The story was frequently featured on CNBC, and it kind of stuck in my memory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What also stayed in my mind was the buyout price range, which hovered around $60 per share. I also remember discussions about Kohl’s real estate portfolio, which was considered highly valuable and was said to be largely lease-free — or at least that’s what was claimed at the time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, I’ll continue to dig deeper to see if there’s more here than just a nice stream of cash flow — which, judging by Mr. Market's perspective, appears to be considered unsustainable in the long run.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on this analysis, I rate Kohl’s as a Hold.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Kohl's In Brief</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Kohl’s began its journey in 1962 with the opening of its first department store in Brookfield, Wisconsin. The company went public in 1992, at which point it operated 76 stores across the Midwest. In 2001, Kohl’s entered the digital era when it launched its online platform, Kohls.com. Over the years, the company has continued to grow and expand, and today it operates more than 1,100 stores across 49 states, additionally supported by a well-established e-commerce presence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1683\" data-height=\"229\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A close-up of a stamp AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"87\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619028597241018_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Kohl's in Figures <span>(Kohl's Presentation )</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Kohl’s has had an outstanding growth story, no doubt, especially considering the scale it has reached today. It’s now the largest independent department store in the U.S. by number of locations — with roughly 1,100 stores, compared to Macy’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/M\" title=\"Macy's, Inc.\">M</a>) around 700 and Nordstrom’s 350. In terms of revenue, Kohl’s ranks second behind Macy’s, generating around $15 billion annually versus Macy’s $22 billion. Nordstrom follows closely, with revenue in a similar range to Kohl's.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The challenge, however, is what they say — yesterday’s gains can become today’s pain. While this isn’t unique to Kohl’s, the entire department store industry is facing more or less the same headwinds - consumers are increasingly buying online. And although both Macy’s and Kohl’s have made strong efforts to grow their digital presence, those gains haven’t fully offset the pressures on their brick-and-mortar revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And here lies Kohl’s unique challenge, in my view — it operates the largest department store network in the U.S. among its peers. Simple logic suggests that generating $15 billion in revenue from 400 stores, like Nordstrom, is more efficient than doing so from 1,100, or compare that to Macy’s, with fewer stores, roughly 700, and around $22 billion in annual revenue.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Competitive Landscape</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In today’s environment, Kohl's large-scale physical retail operations definitely feel more like a burden than a strength.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To gain deeper insight into the competitive dynamics, we can focus on the three remaining department store chains of a similar type still publicly traded after Nordstrom’s buyout. In addition to Macy's, there is also Dillard's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DDS\" title=\"Dillard's, Inc.\">DDS</a>), which fits that type of department store group segment. While they’re definitely not comparable on an apples-to-apples basis — given differences in client segments and marketing strategies—they’re as close as we can get.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, looking at their growth dynamics offers insight into which strategies have performed better in a challenging environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619061751881351.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"288\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619061751881351.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619061751881351.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619061751881351.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619061751881351.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619061751881351.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619061751881351.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619061751881351.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619061751881351.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Kohl's Peer to Peer Growth Analysis <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These comparisons show that over the past five years, Kohl’s has been the underdog in terms of revenue performance, while Macy’s and Dillard’s have managed to post positive overall growth during that period. That said, markets are forward-looking, and Kohl’s projected revenue decline of –4.07% for next year is nearly identical to Macy’s comparable estimate, which is definitely a positive. Another encouraging aspect of this comparison is Kohl’s EBITDA profitability: its forward-looking growth multiple, although still negative, is in line with — or even ahead of — its peer group.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, this comparison clearly shows that the ongoing struggles aren’t unique to Kohl’s, but rather an industry-wide challenge. And while Kohl’s has long been the underdog, the latest data suggests they’ve done solid work recently, and the results indicate that they’re now roughly on par with their peers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Financials</strong></h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Latest Quarterly Results </strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market reacted positively to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4489521-kohls-gives-mixed-q2-results-raises-fy-outlook\">Kohl’s latest results</a>, and shares rallied after the release of better-than-feared second-quarter earnings and an improved outlook for FY25.

After amortization, total tangible assets are reported at $7.297 billion. One might conclude that this reflects hidden real estate undervaluation. However, since real estate is recorded on the balance sheet at its purchase or construction cost and then amortized over time, it doesn’t provide a true picture of current market value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we know, the real value of property depends on what someone is willing to pay for it — the market value — not what it originally cost. So, my conclusion is that while the balance sheet line where real estate is recorded appears conservative, we can't draw any deeper conclusions from it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I found some additional disclosures related to their real estate holdings:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220616982331_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"103\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220616982331_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220616982331_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220616982331_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220616982331_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220616982331_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220616982331_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220616982331_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220616982331_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220616982331_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Kohl's Real Estate Holdings <span>(Kohl's 2024 Annual SEC filing)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that <a href=\"https://crexi.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crexi.com</a> — where quite a few Kohl’s department stores are listed for sale — shows an average price range of $8–15 million, we can use a midpoint estimate of $11 million. Multiplying that by 405 stores yields a total estimated real estate value of approximately $4.46 billion. Since these are very rough estimates, we can reasonably summarize that the value of Kohl’s likely owned stores falls somewhere in the $4–5 billion range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, Kohl's owns distribution centers and e-fulfillment centers. Given that typical industrial or logistics real estate in the U.S. is valued at $50–$100 per square foot — depending on location, condition, and market dynamics — and considering the total footprint of 12.91 million square feet across these facilities, the estimated value range would fall between approximately $645 million and $1.29 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"520\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"354\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-17619220804560013_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Kohl's Distribution Centres <span>(Kohl's 2024 Annual SEC filing)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To summarize, we can conservatively estimate that Kohl’s owns real estate valued at roughly $5 billion. Since the 'Property and Equipment' segment on the balance sheet also includes approximately $2.22 billion in leased property value, the reported ~$7 billion in tangible assets appears to be a reasonable reflection of fair value — especially considering that most other tangible assets carried in balance sheet assets tend to depreciate quickly and typically hold limited value in a liquidation scenario.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I could conclude that I didn’t find any meaningful hidden real estate value that would significantly impact Kohl’s overall valuation. However, the good news is that the assets on the balance sheet are tangible and carry justified real value, which is not always the case. In many instances, balance sheets are dominated by intangible assets like goodwill, software, and similar items that may have little to no real value, especially in a liquidation scenario.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Valuation</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As outlined earlier, Kohl’s price-to-free cash flow (P/FCF) ratio was slightly above 4. When we also consider the EV/EBITDA multiple — calculated at around 2.6 as seen below— it further supports the case for significant undervaluation. This figure is less than half of what would typically be expected, even under conservative assumptions for a company with a \"cash cow\" profile. Some comparable valuation approaches include other long-term financial obligations and capital leases as part of long-term debt; in Kohl’s case, that would add approximately $5 billion to its long-term liabilities. Under this adjusted method, the EV/EBITDA multiple would rise to around 6.5 — not extremely cheap, but still a relatively low valuation.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td>Share Price based on EV/EBITDA calculation, billions $</td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>EBITDA</td> <td>1.24</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Cash</td> <td>0.17</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Debt</td> <td>1.60</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Net Debt</td> <td>1.42</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>EV/EBITDA</strong></td> <td><strong>2.59</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Equity Value/Mcap</td> <td>1.79</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stocks</td> <td>0.11</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stock Price</td> <td>16.00</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"353\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"240\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/5914651-1761928819749482_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Kohl's Adjusted EBITDA <span>(Kohl's 2Q Earnings Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe the current share price is roughly in line with a justified valuation. While fundamental multiples could support a value up to twice as high, the underlying uncertainties — ranging from tariffs to broader threats to the business model — limit that upside potential.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the main risk is, as previously outlined, the execution - five CEO in five years is a great example. If they can't find the right strategy to navigate through the industry challenges, the longer-term sustainability becomes increasingly questionable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second important risk, while not specific to Kohl's, is definitely tariffs. The CEO was asked about that multiple times at the earnings call, and in my mind, he wasn't too worried. I think the case is that it's the same for all retailers. Sooner or later, they need to raise prices where needed, and every retailer must find their best approach to navigate the situation. Management’s position and approach were well articulated by the CEO on the call.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p><em>As we have mentioned before also, we have a diversified sourcing strategy from a country standpoint. We're not heavily reliant on any one particular country, and we have the flexibility and agility to actually move production to other countries if necessary.</em></p> <p><em>The other thing that we are doing, obviously, is working with our vendor and supplier community, negotiating when we do understand and get clarity on tariffs to make sure that we're able to continue to provide the value that we need to our customers. And we're also examining what we can do with our proprietary brands from a value engineering standpoint with the product to keep cost of goods in line with the value that we need to offer to our customers.</em></p> </blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For me, Kohl’s isn’t a meme stock — even if it sometimes acts like one. It’s a value play, backed by a solid balance sheet with tangible real estate assets, but, as they say, it’s skating on thin ice. Navigating a department store business model like Kohl’s, which isn’t exactly fading but isn’t thriving either, is a challenging balancing act, no doubt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s definitely a tough task for management to satisfy everyone in these circumstances — from everyday shoppers to shareholders. The fact that there have been five CEOs in five years says a lot: while everyone could have their own bold vision, the challenge here is deeper than it looks at first glance. Right now, it feels like the current (interim!) management is doing more than just creating bold visions — and from my perspective, while it's too early to draw deeper assessments, they’ve been doing it quite well.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, I’m staying on the sidelines — while the stock price feels nicely balanced, the recent stock's run from $5 to $15 has already priced in some improved execution in my view. That said, I’m ready to jump in if the price dips closer to $10 and/or if management continues to deliver encouraging signs of even stronger prospects ahead.</p>",

(See my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4816136-fuchs-se-guidance-cut-provides-buying-opportunity\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4816136-fuchs-se-guidance-cut-provides-buying-opportunity\" target=\"_blank\">Q2/25 review</a> for details.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Employee numbers did not grow anymore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Compared to Q2/25 alone, earnings grew solidly in all regions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, Fuchs actually beat <a href=\"https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/FUCHS-SE-125841147/finances/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/FUCHS-SE-125841147/finances/\" target=\"_blank\">expectations</a> by a small margin:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong><em>(Euro millions)</em></strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Consensus</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Results</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Sales</strong></p></td> <td><p>892</p></td> <td><p>896</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>EBIT</strong></p></td> <td><p>114</p></td> <td><p>117</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Net income</strong></p></td> <td><p>83</p></td> <td><p>84</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>EPS <em>(Euro)</em></strong></p></td> <td><p>0.63</p></td> <td><p>0.64</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span class=\"highlighted_text\"></span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company confirmed its recently revised outlook for the full year and is highly likely to deliver on that promise as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As mentioned in my previous coverage, this year's earnings are under additional pressure from forex (USD, AUD, Renminbi, and South American currency weakness) and one-off costs related to a series of small acquisitions. Additionally, the substantial, partially acquisition-related headcount increase compared to 2024, coupled with inflation-related wage increases, was a huge burden. Despite all these negatives and the difficult macro environment, after three quarters, Fuchs still delivered stable EBIT in EMEA, and the strong EBIT growth in Asia-Pacific fully compensated for the shortfall in the Americas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the mentioned forex developments effectively mask volume growth and therefore market share gains (forex-adjusted sales growth over 3% YoY), I fully expect the company to return to robust earnings growth once the general business environment stabilizes.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further Considerations And Conclusions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fuchs has a pristine balance sheet with a small net cash position that can provide further optionality for share buybacks or M&amp;A.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that Fuchs produces locally for its various regional markets, it can become a tariff-profiteer if importing competitors need to raise prices to compensate for import tariffs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The German industry anxiously expects the federal government to finally announce concrete reforms and stimulus measure to boost the sluggish economy. Stimulus measures will almost certainly come into effect over the next 12 months and should improve general sentiment and stock market valuations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, corporate taxes are likely to be lowered from 2028. As a result, the current overall tax burden on companies should decrease from nearly 30 percent at present to about 25 percent in 2032. This development so far has been largely ignored by the stock market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fuchs' more liquid preference share currently trades for just 16.7x expected 2025 earnings, while the voting shares are even cheaper at a 13x multiple. In my view, this is too cheap for an excellently managed, resilient, and broadly diversified company which has a stellar growth record and even in these sluggish years earns over 16% on its equity (despite not employing any leverage).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

As shown in the chart below, no other month has experienced a larger median maximum drawdown. Somewhat surprisingly, though, April at -4.5% and January at -4.3% aren’t far behind. What makes the month seem even more volatile than it is, though, is that for anyone who has been around a while, two of the three largest intra-month drawdowns from a high have both occurred in October. In 1987, the S&amp;P 500 declined by more than 34% from peak to trough, while in 2008, it plunged by 28%. The only other months with an intra-month decline of more than 25% were March 2020 (-30.12%) when Covid shut down the economy, and November 2008 (-26.45%) during the financial crisis. It isn’t always a crazy month, but when it is, October sure knows how to disappoint!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1013\" data-height=\"552\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"S&amp;P 500\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"349\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.bespokepremium.com/interactive/posts/think-big-blog/what-volatility\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",
