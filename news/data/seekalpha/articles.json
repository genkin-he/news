(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROKU\" title=\"Roku, Inc.\">ROKU</a></span>) announced its <a href=\"https://image.roku.com/bWFya2V0aW5n/3Q25-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">third quarter results</a> yesterday after market close, and the response has not been particularly positive, with the stock falling from $100 to $94 in post-market trading as of this writing. I wanted<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to take a look in at the stock as I actually thought the report was a solid one. Why, then, the decline?</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Solid Earnings Report</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Roku’s post-market fall might lead some to think that the earnings report was a disappointment, but I really don’t see it. The earnings report itself was fine. Roku reported another quarter of positive net income and, unlike last quarter, this time its operating income was positive as well. For the first time since 2021 in fact. Despite the Devices segment falling back into negative gross profit territory—it had pushed itself to break even in Q2—Platform profit growth was enough to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/roku-sees-operating-income-1236414434/\" rel=\"nofollow\">take operating income to $9.5 million</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Obviously, for a company with a $15 billion market cap that still isn’t very high. But it could be a leading indicator of Roku crossing a tipping point. I believe the drivers of this improved performance are management’s decision to finally pivot to a more subscription-based business model. Since I’ve been arguing for a while that Roku’s advertising focus—which I know many have considered a positive—<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4528260-can-roku-stock-recover-to-100\">was actually a detriment to the company</a>, I’m excited by this new turn. And since subscription, unlike advertising, is still in its very early innings, I’m actually impressed by that small $9.5 million number.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">My Continuing Skepticism About Advertising</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To be clear, I have never argued that Roku cannot generate substantial <em>revenues</em> from free ad-supported streaming television. Roku Channel continues to move up the ladder in <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/data-center/the-gauge/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nielsen’s monthly “The Gauge” report of TV timeshare</a>. In fact, Roku is now the leading streaming channel outside of the Big Four—that's YouTube, Amazon.com, Inc.’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) Prime Video, Netflix, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX\" title=\"Netflix, Inc.\">NFLX</a>) and The Walt Disney Company's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) three separate—for now—services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My concern has always been with how much <em>profit</em> that revenue will yield. I have written about this at length before, so only briefly: Roku’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4577817-what-no-one-is-seeing-about-advertising-push-netflix-and-roku\">lack of broad first-party data on its customers</a> means that it cannot target advertisements at specific demos with the precision that Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) or a Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) could. I believe this means that Roku’s ad-supported service could only ever hope to run at break-even no matter how large it got. You can read more about how I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4479222-roku-some-very-good-news-should-buy-stock\">analyzed the ad operation to arrive at these conclusions</a> here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Setting One Thing Straight Before We Dive In</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The pushback to my “subs not ads” thesis from bulls has always been that Roku does have a lot of data to use, and certainly that has been management’s position. CEO Anthony Wood insisted yet again on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835953-roku-inc-roku-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">today’s earnings conference call</a> that “we have a lot of data” and also argued that “half of all TV streaming happens on our platform.” The implication is that someone who controls half of TV streaming <em>must</em> have some leverage they can use.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I just want to set the record straight on this one more time; Roku does have 50% household penetration, but it does <em>not</em> have 50% of the TV streaming time. This is because many households have devices from multiple manufacturers in their house; my parents have a Roku, an Amazon Fire TV and an Apple Inc.'s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>) Apple Inc. in various rooms of their home. Wood himself later went back and expressed the number this correctly, “we’re in half the broadband households in the country,” which is accurate. But they do not control half of the streaming time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A slightly more reliable indicator is <a href=\"https://www.tvtechnology.com/news/roku-keeps-37-percent-share-of-north-american-ctv-streaming-device-market\" rel=\"nofollow\">the recent survey done by Pixalate</a>, which shows that Roku controls 37% of the open programmatic ads sold on Connected TV devices. That’s a more reasonable estimate that closely aligns with my own research suggesting Roku has about 1/3 of the market. It’s also remarkably steady; a 2017 survey showed <a href=\"https://www.parksassociates.com/blogs/in-the-news/roku-and-amazon-fire-tv-continue-to-gain-market-share--chromecast-and-apple-tv-fall-behind?page=364\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roku with the exact same market share eight years ago</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Pixalate shows Amazon Fire TV in third at 15%, which is not consistent with my estimates that Amazon controls nearly as large a market share as Roku. However, even Pixalate’s survey is not a complete picture; again, these are “open programmatic” sales, not total sales. Because Roku does not have reliable targeting data from first-party sales and search like Amazon and Google have, it sells more through this channel; Amazon’s market share is correspondingly underrepresented in a poll like this because they do have precise targeting data.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Long-Awaited Advertising Strategy Shift</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s probably why after several years of running in the red with their FAST service Roku Channel, Roku has finally decided to bow to the inevitable; the company announced in June that <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/amazon-roku-pool-connected-tv-audiences-advertising-deal-1236432579/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roku would pool their addressable ad pods inside Amazon’s</a> Demand-Side Platform. I consider this auspicious for Roku as it allows better monetization of their ad-supported viewing. Wood confirmed on the call that Amazon’s DSP integration “just” opened, which to me suggests that it probably wasn’t running until sometime in October. If what we are seeing in these numbers is all pre-Amazon, then the early return to operating income, even narrowly, is all the more impressive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But if Amazon hasn’t kicked in yet, how did they do it? Management was effusive about the great work of the teams but typically vague about exactly where they’re getting the best results, which for competitive reasons I guess makes sense. But going by their actions, rather than their words, I think it's because they have finally shifted their focus to subscription, ad-free viewing, and by third quarter that transition already was underway.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally Embracing Subscriptions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Roku announced when it released its first-quarter earnings six months ago that it had <a href=\"https://newsroom.roku.com/news/2025/05/roku-to-acquire-streaming-service-provider-frndly-tv/3bhj9ejl-1746105024\" rel=\"nofollow\">entered into a firm agreement to buy the relatively economical skinny bundle TV service Frndly TV</a>. The bundle offers live programming of a number of secondary channels that are neither sports, news nor broadcast. It is one of the few live services out there with plans below $10 per month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some have pointed to Frndly’s “live” status and said that this acquisition furthers Roku’s advertising ambitions. With respect, I don’t see it that way at all. Yes, Frndly offers live streams with ads. But hardly anyone watches that way, because Frndly has nothing that needs to be watched live and even most broadcast networks now see most of their scripted and reality content consumed on an on-demand basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Frndly’s real appeal to Roku almost certainly is the tech and features they have developed for subscription-based, ad-free viewing; an area in which Roku has little experience since it has, unwisely in my view, spent the past few years developing ad-supported tech stacks and techniques at the expense of any ad-free offering they might have been able to develop.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even CBS, a channel with much more “heft” than Roku or Frndly, has confirmed that as much as <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4046506-cbs-cbs-q4-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript\">85% of the content that its streaming customers consume is on-demand</a>, not live. For a non-sports/news service like Frndly you have to figure that number is a good deal higher still. 90%, at least. Perhaps 95%? <strong><em>99?!?</em></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And far from bemoaning that fact, Frndly management, who remain with the company post-closing, have positively leaned into it. Frndly offers Look Back, a 72-hour window to rewatch anything that has been broadcast on any of its channels, and a significant portion of its total content budget is allocated to services such as the Dove Channel, which offers all of its content ad-free on demand to subscribers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Make no mistake, Frndly is an SVOD service, not an AVOD service. In fact, if not in name. And I think that is precisely why Roku wanted it. It is certainly why I wasn’t unhappy to hear they were acquiring it.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Howdy To You, Too</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Roku followed up <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/roku-launches-howdy-a-2-99-ad-free-streaming-service/\" rel=\"nofollow\">with the launch of Howdy in August</a>. The name notwithstanding, it’s another exciting development as far as I’m concerned. Howdy is a true SVOD service, a la Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) without even Frndly’s largely superfluous live channel offerings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason I consider this a further step is because of Roku’s data. As I said, contrary to management’s protestations, it’s almost certainly not detailed enough to target advertisements effectively. But the one category of data that Roku <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4152051-roku-intriguing-but-dont-buy-until-it-plugs-these-holes\">does have in considerable quantities is viewership data</a>. Roku knows what its customers search for in its Voice Remotes, what they watch on Roku Channel, and, depending on where they find it, sometimes even what they’re watching on other apps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The best use for this data is targeting <em>content</em>, not targeting advertisements. But with Roku Channel, they couldn’t turn a profit on content, and with Frndly they can’t decide what content they get—Lifetime and others program their own channels, Frndly/Roku merely act as broadcaster and salesman.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With Howdy, Roku will <span>finally</span><span> </span>pair ad-free subscriptions with their own content curation efforts. While they’re a long way from being the next Netflix, content curation has considerable potential to yield an enduring profit margin for a subscription video service even without top-tier ad-targeting capabilities, because <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4528281-can-netflix-stock-recover-after-subscriber-loss\">content recommendations can become a self-sustaining internal virtuous cycle</a> in a way that advertising, an intrinsically three-party process, cannot. I wrote before about how the real profit of SVOD, unlike AVOD, lies not in quantity, but in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724075-netflix-stock-new-strategy-fundamentally-changes-dynamics\">intensity and fungibility of viewership</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Crucial to that is a recommendation engine that becomes embedded in consumers' behavioral expectations. Roku needs to prove to viewers that when they want “something” to watch, as opposed to a specific something, Howdy can find them a suitable piece of content with a minimum amount of wasted browsing time. On the earnings call Roku management also indicated that, while it's still early, they’ve seen good results with their decision to upgrade the recommendations engine to the top row of their eponymous home screen. That too is the right move, and I expect it will continue to bear fruit.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Very Preliminary Estimate</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Precisely because it’s so early, putting numbers on exactly how much profit Roku can generate from this is a little harder. Howdy is a $3 per month service, at least to start, and it won’t be profitable until it achieves critical mass. However, with the Q3 report out we do now see the first full quarter of Frndly TV’s operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite their press release and earnings call today, Roku has not yet filed their official Q3 10-Q at the time of writing, so I don’t have all the data I would like. For now, I am going to use an imputation model based on the assumption that Howdy will be programmed to produce a similar profit per subscriber to Frndly TV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q2, <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001428439/dcade249-7112-47a7-8a7f-2700bf8f7668.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">management disclosed that</a> Frndly represented roughly 1.8 percentage points of the growth in the Platform segment the company had seen, or roughly $15 million. That was for almost exactly two months. At Frndly’s price of $11 per month on <a href=\"https://www.frndlytv.com/choose-plan-2-annual\" rel=\"nofollow\">their standard, mid-tier plan</a> that comes to roughly 700,000 subscribers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I continue to believe, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757679-roku-even-a-smaller-share-of-a-larger-pie-makes-it-a-solid-buy\">as I’ve calculated in prior articles</a>, that Roku’s subscription business is of sufficient size to justify its current market cap. If 700,000 Frndly subscribers can produce $38 million of increased income per year ($9.5 million times four) then at a 25 P/E that is worth almost $1 billion in additional market cap. Currently, Roku and Amazon are performing similarly in the CTV market, and Amazon has roughly 1/3 of Netflix’s viewership in the US. That would suggest Howdy and Frndly together might be able to get to as many as 25 million subscribers in the US. That would be enough to increase market cap by $35 billion, more than tripling Roku’s current share price!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That seems optimistic to me; I suspect these numbers are slanted by the fact that Roku and Amazon both report to the Nielsen Gauge not only their own viewership but also the premium subscriptions—HBO Max, Peacock, etc.—that are routed through their platforms. If we assume they represent half the viewership reported, SVOD will “only” double Roku’s market cap.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the past few years, I have been following a straightforward approach to Roku: ride the rollercoaster. That’s not always a good thing in stock trading, but when the highs and lows hold firm it can be very lucrative. I have an entry point around $60 and a sell point around $100. Three times in the past two years, Roku has run right up to the edge of the $100 point, and each time it has done so rebounding off of a sub-$60 floor. It's been possible to simply rinse and repeat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am wondering if this pattern is starting to break down. The release of Roku’s second-quarter earnings sent the stock plunging even though they came in mostly better than expected. It went back below $80. But then it rebounded back to $100.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now it reports another good earnings, the stock falls again anyway….but only to $94. It’s been quite a while since Roku saw the sub-$60 range. And the developments of recent weeks suggest that perhaps it won’t again anytime soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I confess to being torn. I’m considerably more positive on Roku now than I was before they pivoted from advertising to subscription. But my high-low formula has been a consistent performer for the past few years. Should I abandon it and buy in now, or await a future dip?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am honestly unsure. When torn between a weak Buy and a strong Hold, I usually opt for the latter to avoid buying something I lack complete conviction in. But the truth is I don’t lack conviction in Roku’s upside; I just question whether it will be even cheaper later than it is now.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have not yet bought in, but I may today. I’ll see how it opens, but regardless of whether it returns to its floor again or not, I believe Roku is finally ready to break through its ceiling in the coming months. As such, while I am not completely sure of the timing of my next Roku purchase yet, I am going to give it a Buy rating.</p>",

For our new readers, Lufthansa is one of the largest<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> airlines, and its network airlines segment includes SWISS, ITA, Austrian, Brussels Airlines, and a low-cost operator called Eurowings. Additionally, Lufthansa offers aviation services such as Cargo, MRO, and catering.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lufthansa’s CMD set ambitious margin ambitions, a leaner fleet plan, and clear priorities across business segments. Management expressed confidence in exceeding pre-COVID margin levels, underpinned by a stronger balance sheet, improving FCF, and rising shareholder payouts. At today’s market value, the MRO franchise alone accounts for a large share of the enterprise value.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q3, Lufthansa Group's top-line sales were €11.2 billion, up 11% from the previous year. As the company <a href=\"https://newsroom.lufthansagroup.com/en/lufthansa-group-achieves-operating-profit-of-13-billion-euros-in-the-third-quarter-and-confirms-outlook-for-significant-profit-increase-for-the-full-year/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a>, \"<em>this was the strongest quarter in terms of revenue in the history of the Lufthansa Group</em>.\" EBIT reached €1.3 billion, which was at the previous year's level; however, EBIT margin declined by 60 basis points to 11.9%. Passenger yields were weaker at -5.4% and dragged down by Europe and North America. On a positive note, Lufthansa Cargo continued its positive trajectory with an EBIT of €49 million. Meanwhile, the Lufthansa Technik [MRO] segment reported an EBIT decrease. The division reached an EBIT of €130 million. Going down to the P&amp;L, the company's net profit amounted to €966 million as tax weighed into results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1856\" data-height=\"788\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\" Lufthansa Q3 results\" width=\"640\" height=\"272\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span> Lufthansa Q3 results </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: <a href=\"https://investor-relations.lufthansagroup.com/fileadmin/downloads/en/charts-speeches/LH-QR-2025-3-charts-aerjrtn.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lufthansa Q3 results ppt</a> - Fig 1</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why Are We positive?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's quarterly results look fine, though the first read skews more negative than positive. However, digging into the report, we remain constructive for the following reason:</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">MRO Upside Is Still There, And Supportive Cost-Management</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The MRO division's core operating profit decreased to €130 million compared to €161 million in Q3 2024. Higher tariffs, a weaker dollar, and additional costs to production ramp-up negatively impacted the segment. That said, top-line sales were up by 10%, and the company reported a solid order book. Looking forward (Fig. 2), Lufthansa won maintenance contracts with EasyJet and Cathay Group.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Within the adjusted EBIT detail, Pax Airlines delivered a flat performance compared to Q3 2024. This result was achieved with ex-fuel unit costs up to 0.5% and should be positively received.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1288\" data-height=\"498\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\" Lufthansa MRO Upside\" width=\"640\" height=\"247\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span> Lufthansa MRO Upside</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fig 2</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FCF And Deleverage Path</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 FCF was materially higher than expected, reaching €818 million (Fig. 1).

The company confirmed its yearly guidance and reported a higher EBIT than in 2024 (which reached €1.64 billion). Considering this print, Lufthansa's core operating profit amounted to €1.5 billion year-to-date, up by €300 million compared to last year's level. Q4 is a strong quarter for Pax Airlines and Cargo, while it is softer on MRO. Recent booking trends also suggest higher volumes. Our valuation is backed by a sum-of-the-parts thesis, which includes the airlines and MRO segment. On a YTD results, the airlines generated an EBIT of €1.2 billion, and are targeting a 1.6-1.7 billion result by year-end. While the MRO division has an €800 million core operating profit performance. Considering the Cargo business, we believe a €3 billion core operating profit is still achievable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As reported in our Q3 results paragraph, there was a higher tax rate in the third quarter; however, we applied the corporate tax rate of 25%. So, our income projections are set at €2.1 billion, which derives an EPS of €1.75. With no change to our valuation methodology (6x P/E target), Lufthansa's price is confirmed at €10.5 per share ($12.15 in ADR).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lufthansa's current market cap is €8.6 billion. As a reminder, a group of private equity firms <a href=\"https://pe-insights.com/bains-negotiation-stalled-as-lufthansa-cancels-8-7bn-technik-sale/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tried</a> to acquire the MRO division, valuing the subsidiary at approximately $8.7 billion (€7.5 billion). Considering the evolution of FCF, the company will likely exceed its FCF target of €800 million with a potential further debt repayment. We are not underwriting 2026 yet (with supportive evidence from the CMD update). Still, aside from ongoing cost optimization, there is also a higher capacity in 2026, with the company expecting an increase of 4%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our downside risks include the company's ongoing restructuring initiatives, estimated at €1.5 billion, and higher competition from low-cost operators. Lufthansa's risks are also lower due to lower travel demand from business and leisure, changes in oil prices, wage inflation, higher regulatory standards and airport costs, FX changes, and all the negative event risks related to travel, such as airport shutdowns, cybersecurity risks, natural catastrophes, and terrorist actions/attacks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 results de-risk Lufthansa's investment thesis, and there is upside valuation to consider. Following the CMD release, the company has a clear earnings/transforming roadmap for delivery. Therefore, our buy rating is confirmed.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut helped lift stocks, as did economic data showing that, while there may be some pockets of<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> concern, the U.S. economy remained steady. In this environment, the Russell 2500 </span><sup class=\"paywall-full-content\">TM</sup><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> Index was up 9.00%. The Wasatch Long/Short Alpha Fund—Investor Class (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WALSX\" title=\"Wasatch Long/Short Alpha Fund Investor Class Shares\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">WALSX</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) did not keep pace and finished the period down -7.25%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The quarter was indeed a challenging one for the Fund. In what we would characterize as a very strong “risk-on” environment, the stocks of low-quality companies outperformed the stocks of high-quality businesses. This was a structural headwind for our Fund, which aims to be long on high-quality companies, and to short the stocks of companies we perceive as low quality.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we explain more in our Outlook section, we believe such positioning will serve us well through the investment cycle. But when low quality outperforms high quality, and when stocks we view as more speculative experience the highest returns, it works against the Fund in two ways. First, our long positions, which again we consider high quality, underperform the benchmark. Second, when we short stocks we perceive as low quality and those stocks rise, our short positions also detract from performance. This dynamic was in play throughout the quarter, in an environment we believe was as speculative and euphoric as the post-Covid market rebound in late 2020 and early 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the magnitude of this headwind on Fund performance, we wanted to share a little more detail on the strength of the low-quality rally. As we mentioned last quarter, stocks have rallied sharply since mid-April. And for the most part, the stocks of lower quality companies have been leading the charge.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Many of the top-performing stocks in recent months have been those of companies that have speculative business models, in our view, and often have little to no earnings. They’re often tied to popular investment themes such as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, cryptocurrency, nuclear power, aerospace and defense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The chart below shows how extreme a headwind this has been. The chart displays one of the ways Wasatch’s research team assesses whether high- or low-quality stocks are in favor. Through a proprietary process, we screen and rank all the companies in the small- and mid-cap universe based on several financial characteristics, such as return on assets and operating profit margins, among other items. Using the aggregate score we obtain, we then compare how the companies in the top quintile perform relative to the bottom quintile. Based on this metric, we’ve rarely seen a low-quality rally approach this magnitude over the past decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-17619145491080637_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"958\" data-height=\"671\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-17619145491080637_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"high vs. low quality performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"448\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-17619145491080637_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-17619145491080637_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-17619145491080637_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-17619145491080637_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-17619145491080637_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-17619145491080637_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-17619145491080637_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-17619145491080637_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, a few statistics point to how low quality has been in favor. The statistics are for the Russell 2000® Growth Index, which is the benchmark for some of our U.S.-focused small cap strategies. For the third quarter, 56 stocks were up 80% or more. Of that group, 82% are unprofitable, and 57% within the group trade at a multiple of 10 times sales or greater. We view this multiple, which looks at revenue and not earnings, as extreme.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can’t predict when the period favoring the stocks of low-quality companies will end. But periods of low-quality outperformance have historically been short-lived. The stocks of high-quality businesses have outperformed over the long term. We believe that will continue to be the case.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Details of the quarter</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among our long positions, one of the largest detractors was Inspire Medical Systems, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INSP\" title=\"Inspire Medical Systems, Inc.\">INSP</a>). Inspire develops implantable neurostimulators for treating obstructive sleep apnea. The company’s shares slid in August after management downgraded full-year 2025 guidance due to delays in the U.S. commercial rollout of its next-generation Inspire V system. The delayed rollout of Inspire V raised questions about execution by management and caused us to trim the position. Additionally, concerns are growing about how GLP-1 drugs may affect Inspire’s addressable market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another detractor was Shift4 Payments, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FOUR\" title=\"Shift4 Payments, Inc.\">FOUR</a>). A longtime holding in many of our small-cap funds, Shift4 is a U.S. company that provides payment processing solutions for hospitality, retail and e-commerce businesses. Fundamentals for the company remain solid, as organic revenues grew in the high-teens percentages in the most recent quarter. But the stock has been down in part due to concerns about how a softer macroeconomic environment could affect the company. Additionally, investor sentiment on the company became less favorable after its acquisition of Global Blue, which is a foray into a new customer segment for Shift4. The acquisition also means the company is taking on more debt. Acquisitions can sometimes cause investors angst since they take time to integrate into a company’s normal operations. However, we have confidence in Shift4’s leadership and their ability to execute on Global Blue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Freshpet, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FRPT\" title=\"Freshpet, Inc.\">FRPT</a>) also detracted. The company manufactures refrigerated dog and cat food and treats. In general, pet owners have been less willing to pay for premium fresh pet food in the current economic environment. However, we continue to like the company. Even in today’s environment, we’ve seen Freshpet take market share from other premium pet foods. And we believe investments the company has made to expand its manufacturing footprint have reached a tipping point that could drive cashflows meaningfully higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Medpace Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MEDP\" title=\"Medpace Holdings, Inc.\">MEDP</a>) was the top contributor to Fund performance during the quarter. The contract research organization provides drug development, clinical trial management, and regulatory services to biotech, pharmaceutical, and medical device companies. Medpace’s shares jumped after management reported strong revenue and earnings growth and raised its full-year guidance. We believe those results are particularly impressive in light of the fact there’s been a slowdown in the biotech funding cycle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another top contributor was Fabrinet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FN\" title=\"Fabrinet\">FN</a>). The company designs, manufactures, and tests complex optoelectronic and photonic components, modules, and precision optical assemblies for customers in a variety of industries. Some of its products are used in data centers, which makes the company tied somewhat to AI. As mentioned, this has been a popular theme among investors, and likely helped drive the stock higher. However, we don’t hold the stock as a thematic play on AI. The company is experiencing strong adoption of its products with both new and existing customers. We believe Fabrinet is well positioned to grow regardless of AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Turning to short positions, detractors from Fund performance were those stocks that rose in price. One of the largest detractors was Opendoor Technologies, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPEN\" title=\"Opendoor Technologies Inc.\">OPEN</a>). The company operates a digital real estate platform that provides services for buying and selling residential properties online. We viewed the company as lower quality, given questions about the viability of the business model, and shorted the stock to offset some of our long positions tied to the housing industry. However, Opendoor became a “meme stock” popular among investors in Reddit investment forums and the stock price rose as investors piled in. We did not want to invest against that type of market dynamic and quickly covered the short position.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among shorts, contributors to Fund performance were those stocks that declined in price. One of the largest contributors was Sweetgreen, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SG\" title=\"Sweetgreen, Inc.\">SG</a>), a fast-casual restaurant chain that specializes in made-to-order salads and grain bowls. We short the position as a hedge against some of our long positions in the consumer-discretionary and consumer-staples sectors. Companies in these sectors can be impacted when consumer spending turns weak. And this quarter, most stocks of restaurant companies were indeed down due to such concerns. <em>(Current and future holdings are subject to risk and change.)</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook and Positioning</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While performance this period was painful, we wouldn’t expect the Fund to keep up in what we view as an extreme risk-on environment. We’re seeing a lot of capital flow to companies with highly speculative business models, where there may not even be a commercially viable product or service yet—just a research department and a business plan. In our view, the amount of speculation in the market today is eerily similar to that of the internet bubble, or the post-Covid environment in late 2020 and 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the speculation that has taken place leaves us excited about the Fund’s return potential from here. The run up in stock prices of what we believe are low-quality businesses has given us an opportunity to short stocks that look extremely overpriced. And on the long side, our companies have generally continued to generate strong earnings growth, though we believe fundamentals have mattered less to investors in a speculative market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the way we feel about the portfolio and the market environment, we’ve increased the Fund’s gross exposure, and have done so by increasing both long and short exposure. We can’t predict when the current speculative, risk-on environment will subside. But when it does, we believe the Fund is well positioned for it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thank you for the opportunity to manage your assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sincerely,</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mick Rasmussen</strong></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p><em>The performance data quoted represents past performance.

Our customers usually build for the holiday season in -- sort of before that, and then that will be completed by the fourth quarter. So we would expect as the Client and Gaming segment, that the segment would probably be down in the fourth quarter.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The words \"down substantially\" are not encouraging, but consider that gaming was just 14.5% of the consolidated revenue in Q2. The narrative of the company is mainly driven by the data center segment, and that's where the focus in Q3 will be.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Risks To Monitor</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's start with China. Management said that MI308 sales to China were effectively eliminated from their projections. If you look at the chart from the previous section showing the data center AI segment, you may notice that the top line growth declined from 57.2% YOY in Q1 2025 to 14.3% YOY in Q2.

An update on the exports to China is highly anticipated by the Street, although I wouldn't expect management to include China revenue in their guidance for Q4. Why?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, chips are the main leverage the U.S. holds over China in the November 10 negotiations. Since AMD reports earnings on November 4, I see little to no chance that Lisa Su will include MI308 sales to China in Q4. Furthermore, recent reporting indicates the U.S. and China <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/looming-trump-xi-meeting-revives-hope-us-china-trade-truce-2025-10-29/\" rel=\"nofollow\">agreed</a> to keep the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ceb9d271-09b4-4066-87a7-1e93b6908640\" rel=\"nofollow\">truce</a> in place rather than letting it lapse on November 10. In other words, even if AMD and Nvidia were cleared to resume exports of certain AI accelerators to China in August in <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/08/11/news-nvidia-amd-make-historic-deal-reportedly-pay-15-of-h20-mi308-china-sales-for-export-licenses/\" rel=\"noopener\">exchange</a> for a 15% \"tax\" to the US government, I wouldn't expect a significant uplift from China in the near term. Why?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the last Q&amp;A session, Lisa pointed out:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We do expect that once those licenses are approved, we will start MI308 shipments. In terms of the supply chain, most of our inventory was not in finished goods, so it was work in process, and it will take us a couple of quarters to run through that. The exact timing of revenue and contribution will depend a bit on when those are -- when the licenses are actually granted.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Her remark that \"it will take us a couple of quarters to run through that\" is not encouraging to me. Therefore, I wouldn't expect sales in China to return this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This means that the $800 million inventory charge tied to export restrictions will continue to pressure gross margins.

That said, I downgrade my AMD rating to a Buy, as the risk of a pullback has increased since my last coverage.</p>",

Then Powell threw more fuel on the dollar on Wednesday by shedding doubts on the already<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> taken-for-granted rate cut in December.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The debasement-trade promos in the financial and social media had exhorted people to pile into cryptos, gold, silver, and sometimes even stocks because government borrowing and money printing would rapidly erode the value of the US dollar. As in all these trades, if enough people follow, prices of the targeted instruments would explode, at least for a little while, and people that could get out in time would make lots of money.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But the huge <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829666-huge-us-bond-market-and-us-dollar-blow-off-debasement-trade\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">bond market brushed off the debasement trade</a>, and the dollar started zigzagging higher in late September. Then came Powell.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">“A further reduction in the policy rate at the December meeting is not a forgone conclusion, far from it,” Powell said in his prepared remarks at the FOMC press conference on Wednesday.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then, in response to a question, he said: \"So, we are at a place where we’ve cut two more times. Now we are 150 basis points closer to neutral, whatever that may be, than we were a year ago. There is a growing chorus now of feeling like maybe this is where we should at least wait a cycle.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Upon which the dollar rose further against other currencies and continued that way on Thursday.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The DXY Dollar Index [DXY] </strong>rose 0.4% on Wednesday and again 0.4% on Thursday to 99.6, the highest since the brief spike at the end of July, and before then the highest since May.

There were many six-month declines that were bigger, including in 2023 and 2020. But by coincidence of the calendar, it was the biggest decline from a December 31 through a June 30.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_US-DXY-10-30-2025_long.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The U.S. Dollar Gets More Fuel From Powell's Doubts About December Rate Cut\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"989\" height=\"771\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_US-DXY-10-30-2025_long.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_US-DXY-10-30-2025_long.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_US-DXY-10-30-2025_long.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_US-DXY-10-30-2025_long.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_US-DXY-10-30-2025_long.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_US-DXY-10-30-2025_long.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_US-DXY-10-30-2025_long.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_US-DXY-10-30-2025_long.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The WSJ Dollar Index [BUXX],</strong> which is far broader than the DXY, rose by 0.4% on Wednesday and 0.5% on Thursday, to 96.7, the highest since the brief spike at the end of July, and before then the highest since May.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The BUXX is trade-weighted and tracks the USD against the 16 currencies of the Euro Area, Japan, China, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, India, Hong Kong, Singapore, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and Sweden.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_US-BUXX-10-30-2025.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The U.S. Dollar Gets More Fuel From Powell's Doubts About December Rate Cut\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"975\" height=\"771\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_US-BUXX-10-30-2025.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_US-BUXX-10-30-2025.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_US-BUXX-10-30-2025.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_US-BUXX-10-30-2025.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_US-BUXX-10-30-2025.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_US-BUXX-10-30-2025.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_US-BUXX-10-30-2025.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_US-BUXX-10-30-2025.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://wolfstreet.com/2025/10/29/fed-cuts-by-25-basis-points-with-2-dissents-in-opposite-directions-qt-to-end-but-mbs-to-continue-rolling-off-to-be-replaced-by-t-bills/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">Fed’s policy interest rates, at 3.75% to 4.0%</a>, are among the highest of the developed economies.

Its technological leadership at 3nm and 2nm nodes, unrivaled customer base that includes Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), Apple (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">AAPL</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), AMD (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">AMD</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), and consistently high margins have made it the backbone of the latest AI hardware boom.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, after its stock rallied by around 50% since the beginning of the year, it is now priced for perfection. Currently, TSMC <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM/valuation/metrics\">trades</a> at over 29 times its forward earnings, similar to premium U.S. tech companies, despite operating in a region facing escalating geopolitical tensions and expanding capital intensity. Although the short-term demand for AI chips remains significant, the company faces challenges that can undermine its further upside. After all, its free cash flow is falling, capital expenditures are at record highs, and profitability will likely face headwinds as overseas fabs ramp up production of new chips. Because of that, we<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4782070-tsmc-tariffs-are-about-to-bite-hard\"> continue</a> to rate TSMC as a <em>sell</em>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>New Challenges On The Horizon</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There’s no denying that TSMC’s Q3 results were strong, as its revenues increased by 41% Y/Y to $33.1 billion, while gross margin rose to 59.5% and net margin reached nearly 46%. In addition, advanced nodes (7nm and below) now account for 74% of wafer revenue, with AI-related demand driving much of the growth. As a result of this, TSMC’s management even<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830321-taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-limited-tsm-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\"> raised</a> its full-year revenue forecast to over a 30% revenue growth rate, mostly thanks to the continuous AI tailwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, there are several things that can undermine TSMC’s further upside. Currently, the market is pricing TSMC as if its annual growth of over 30% will continue indefinitely, which we believe is an unlikely scenario given the cyclical nature of the semiconductor business. History shows that every foundry refresh cycle, even one driven by significant technological shifts, has been followed by a normalization of the growth rate once demand subsides. With AI wafer orders from Nvidia, AMD, and Apple <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830321-taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-limited-tsm-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">expected</a> to remain flat in 2026, TSMC’s growth next year could slow significantly, while costs will likely remain high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After all, TSMC’s CapEx for 2025 has been <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830321-taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-limited-tsm-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">raised</a> again to $40-42 billion, which is almost in line with its forecasted annual free cash flow. Over 70% of this spending is directed at advanced technologies (3nm, 2nm, A16) and CoWoS packaging, while 10-20% is for funding the fab expansion primarily in the US, Japan, and Germany. While these investments are critical to maintaining leadership, they pose two structural challenges. First, free cash flow is being squeezed since TSMC generated only $4.3 billion in free cash flow in Q3 despite having record profits. Secondly, the erosion of overseas fab profitability is also a major issue. The management currently estimates that margins from operations outside Taiwan will reduce gross margin by 2-3% by 2026. This means that even with revenue growth, each new dollar of sales provides a lower return on invested capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the effectiveness of these investments has increasingly been questioned as numerous projects have faced cost overruns, labor shortages, and infrastructure delays. The <a href=\"https://globaltaiwan.org/2025/03/taiwans-shortage-of-chipmakers-a-major-threat-to-the-industrys-long-term-growth/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arizona</a> plant, originally budgeted at $12 billion and initially expected to start production in 2024, was pushed back to 2025 due to a shortage of qualified technicians. Similarly, a second <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/tsmcs-second-japanese-fab-reportedly-delayed-mass-production-pushed-to-2029\" rel=\"nofollow\">Japanese</a> plant (JASM Phase 2) has been delayed by up to 18 months, pushing mass production to 2029 due to inadequate local infrastructure and logistical inefficiencies. This raises structural concerns about declining return on investment (ROIC) and future margin compression.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to that, despite expanding its U.S. operations, TSMC still remains highly vulnerable to tensions between China and Taiwan. About <a href=\"https://www.casaasia.eu/actualidad/el-dominio-asiatico-en-la-industria-de-semiconductores/\" rel=\"nofollow\">70%</a> of its production still takes place on the island in East Asia, and management has repeatedly<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830321-taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-limited-tsm-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\"> acknowledged</a> that <em>Taiwan remains indispensable</em> for integrating advanced processes. As such, any escalation in the Taiwan Strait could disrupt the global semiconductor supply chain. So far, the market has been complacent about this risk. While Nvidia and Broadcom are geographically diversified and are not capital-heavy businesses, TSMC bears the brunt of both geopolitical risks and capital intensity, and yet it still trades at similar multiples to those two companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At more than 31x forward earnings and 18x EV/EBITDA, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM/valuation/metrics\">TSMC is now valued</a> closer to Nvidia or Apple than its historical average of 20-22x. This multiple expansion assumes sustained revenue growth of 30-40% and stable margins of 60%, which we believe is unrealistic given rising CAPEX and potentially higher costs of running business outside Taiwan. The market is effectively pricing TSMC as if it were a geopolitically agnostic company that’s operating only in the United States, which is not the case. Right now, TSMC is a company that operates in an environment of increasing regional risks. Even with an unrivaled technical edge, the company, in our opinion, cannot command the same valuation premium as its Western customers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks To Our Bearish Thesis</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are several factors that could cast doubt on our pessimistic outlook. The AI demand curve could continue to surprise from the bottom up, supporting wafer utilization and pricing for longer than we expect. Also, the company’s dominance in the CoWoS packaging industry makes it possible to benefit from the growth in demand for AI accelerators, where capacity remains limited. In addition, TSMC’s N2 and A16 nodes could also enter mass production ahead of schedule, providing another wave of unrivaled technological leadership.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Real Value Of TSMC</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To find out TSMC’s fair value, we built a valuation model at a time when the stock was trading at $305.09 per share. The model assumes a 3% terminal growth rate, consistent with the rate that we used when valuing other <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/bears-of-wall-street/analysis\">semiconductor</a> companies. Our forecast covers the next 5 years and incorporates inputs such as cash and total <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM/balance-sheet\">debt</a> from the most recent earnings report.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The model applies a discount rate of 8.43%, derived from TSMC’s estimated cost of equity and cost of debt. The cost of debt was based primarily on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM/income-statement\">TTM</a> data, while the cost of equity was calculated using the CAPM method with a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y\">risk-free rate</a> of 4.10%, a <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSM/\" rel=\"nofollow\">beta</a> of 1.22, and a market <a href=\"https://www.officialdata.org/us/stocks/s-p-500/1950?amount=100&amp;endYear=2024\" rel=\"nofollow\">return rate</a> of 7.77%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103235198812_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1620\" data-height=\"438\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103235198812_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TSMC’s valuation model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"173\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103235198812_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103235198812_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103235198812_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103235198812_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103235198812_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103235198812_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103235198812_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103235198812_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">TSMC’s valuation model <span>(Bears of Wall Street)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our revenue and EBIT projections for TSMC over the next 5 years are broadly similar to the overall <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM/earnings/estimates\">consensus</a> estimates. We also anticipate a gradual decline in EBIT margins, as macroeconomic headwinds and seasonal fluctuations could weigh on profitability. In our model, we also applied a 15% tax rate, in line with the assumptions used in our prior valuation models. The CapEx is projected to be around 41.8 billion in 2025, which is close to the management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830321-taiwan-semiconductor-manufacturing-company-limited-tsm-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">estimates</a>. The change in net working capital is modeled at 5% of sales. Based on these inputs, our model estimates TSMC’s enterprise value to be $871.15 billion and its equity value to be $930.02 billion, which implies an intrinsic value of $179.19 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-1761910324371625_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1617\" data-height=\"591\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-1761910324371625_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TSMC’s DCF valuation model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"234\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-1761910324371625_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-1761910324371625_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-1761910324371625_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-1761910324371625_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-1761910324371625_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-1761910324371625_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-1761910324371625_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-1761910324371625_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">TSMC’s DCF valuation model <span>(Bears of Wall Street)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to this model, we also conducted a comparative valuation analysis using a peer group of semiconductor companies. The peer group included leading companies such as NVIDIA, AMD, Micron, and Broadcom, as well as tier-2 players such as Texas Instruments, NXP Semiconductors, ASE Technology, and United Microelectronics, among others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our analysis relied on three primary valuation ratios: price-to-sales (P/S), price-to-earnings (P/E), and EV/EBITDA. By comparing TSMC’s current trading multiples to the median of this peer group, we estimated the company’s relative fair value. The median of peers suggests a valuation of $101.00 per share based on a P/S, $238.58 per share based on a P/E, and $230.80 per share based on an EV/EBITDA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Averaging these three approaches yields a fair value estimate of $190.14 per share. Equating the peer multiple and DCF model (50/50) methods to the methods most relevant to the semiconductor business yields a fair value estimate of $184.66 per share, indicating a 39.5% discount to the current market price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103251966093_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1478\" data-height=\"524\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103251966093_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TSMC’s comparable analysis\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"227\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103251966093_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103251966093_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103251966093_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103251966093_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103251966093_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103251966093_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103251966093_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48206420-17619103251966093_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">TSMC’s comparable analysis <span>(Bears of Wall Street)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although TSMC has been performing great in recent quarters, its stock is priced for perfection. The company’s reliance on cyclical demand for AI, record CapEx, and geopolitical risks could make it more challenging for it to perform well in the following years. Even if TSMC remains a technological leader in the semiconductor industry, the combination of increased spending, higher costs from overseas expansion, and other rising risks leaves little room for further growth. Considering that at today’s price, TSMC offers more risks than rewards, we decided to continue to rate its stock as a <em>sell</em>.</p>",

The main drivers were a pronounced slowdown in regulated energy<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and fresh food prices, more than offsetting the acceleration in prices for recreational, cultural, and personal care services. Core inflation, which excludes fresh food and energy, remained stable at 2%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Goods prices slowed to just 0.2% year-on-year, while service inflation held steady at 2.6%, widening the gap between the two to 0.4 percentage points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today’s data confirms that the energy component remains pivotal in shaping the overall inflation trajectory. A comparison with gas and electricity prices recorded over the last two months of 2024 suggests that this base effect is unlikely to fade soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stability of core and service inflation, which are, of course, closely linked, also hints that, at the start of the third quarter, consumer demand is not accelerating, at least on the services front. This is indirectly confirmed by the October business confidence survey for the services sector, which showed a clear slowdown in price change intentions for the next three months. The same indicator for manufactured goods pointed to stable pricing intentions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, economic stagnation is bringing about a cooling of inflation that is unlikely to reverse sharply in the near term, unless there are unpredictable surprises in energy commodity prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, we are revising down our forecast for average inflation in 2025 from 1.7% to 1.6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Hopefully, you will find something valuable in this piece for yourself as well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Understanding eBay</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have a hard time understanding what’s going on with eBay. I went over <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/16319322\">their 10-Q</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835093-ebay-inc-ebay-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">their earnings call</a>, and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835090-ebay-inc-2025-q3-results-earnings-call-presentation\">their presentation</a>, and while the results look fine, I can’t shake off the feeling that there’s something off.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">eBay’s focus lately has shifted from being a platform for everything to narrowing down to its top categories, which mostly include car parts and accessories and trading cards. There are other things, of course, like handbags, sneakers, etc., but the first two seem to be the strongest either in absolute terms or in growth rate. So while I can see that these segments are growing very nicely for the company, I’m still struggling to understand what kind of business eBay really is today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1976\" data-height=\"1016\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q3 2025 eBay Earnings Presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"329\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/62060938-17619068503239007_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Q3 2025 eBay Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Their GMV is up by an impressive 8%, which is great, but at the same time, their gross profit margin has been going down over the last few years.

The results look great, but at the same time, the overall situation is not perfect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6ad1c88e0f75b907a078851621b79995.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6ad1c88e0f75b907a078851621b79995.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6ad1c88e0f75b907a078851621b79995.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6ad1c88e0f75b907a078851621b79995.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6ad1c88e0f75b907a078851621b79995.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6ad1c88e0f75b907a078851621b79995.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6ad1c88e0f75b907a078851621b79995.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6ad1c88e0f75b907a078851621b79995.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6ad1c88e0f75b907a078851621b79995.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Focus Categories</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s start with the part of their business that I actually like—car parts and accessories. This is one of eBay’s biggest growth segments right now, contributing more than one percentage point to the company’s total GMV growth. They already have over 750 million listings just for parts and accessories, which makes it the largest online selection of unique auto parts in most major markets.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Motor parts and accessories, or P&amp;A, was our second largest contributor to GMV growth in Q3, generating more than 1 point for the overall marketplace. The introduction of easy and free returns in the U.S. continued to build upon our trusted value proposition in P&amp;A, while the cost and return rates for this program are well within our forecasted ranges. We continue to expand choice and selection in key inventory segments such as salvage and used parts, which help consumers find value at a time when many are stretched financially. Overall, we have over 750 million live P&amp;A listings, which enables us to offer the largest online selection of unique auto parts and accessories in most of our major markets.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Probably, I like this part of eBay’s business the most because I have an understanding of how big this market could be and how profitable it is. One of my father’s businesses back in Ukraine is a shop where they dismantle used cars and sell the parts online similarly to how eBay’s platform works. It’s a different website, but you also have sellers listing items, buyers purchasing them, and the seller shipping the parts once ordered. It’s also a huge platform back in Ukraine, and every person has heard of it and most likely used it at least once.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It has been a great business in Ukraine, especially since the war started and people try to maintain their cars longer, but also before it worked out handsomely. So, I completely understand why this category does well in the U.S. as well. It’s a huge market. The population is layered, so not everyone replaces their car every few years, and the demand for affordable parts is always present.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A fact that is not directly related but interesting nonetheless: I live in Israel now, and my economics professor mentioned that Israel has one of the youngest vehicle fleets in the world. People here replace cars roughly every five years, and the used ones get shipped abroad. That’s definitely not the case in the U.S. According to Reuters, Americans now <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/americans-keep-vehicles-record-126-years-average-despite-easing-supplies-sp-says-2024-05-22/#:~:text=Americans%20keep%20vehicles%20for%20record,easing%20supplies%2C%20S&amp;P%20says%20%7C%20Reuters\" rel=\"nofollow\">keep their cars</a> for a record of 12.6 years on average, which is a substantial period of time. So this part of eBay’s business makes perfect sense to me, and I actually like it a lot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But then there’s the other focus category—trading cards. I know this category has been growing for some time now, and I understand that there’s a collector market around it, but to me, it just sounds ridiculous. The company said that Pokémon GMV grew triple digits for the third straight quarter and that collectibles were its largest contributor to growth this time. This is something that makes me less attracted to this business, because it doesn’t sound sustainable to me personally. I genuinely can’t understand how someone can spend hundreds of dollars on a stack of cards that just sits on a shelf. Maybe it’s because I don’t have kids and don’t understand the fascination, but it just feels strange to me that one of eBay’s main growth engines depends on this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, one of the new things they have is live trading events, with celebrities like Logan Paul or NBA players joining streams on eBay Live. Possibly, I don’t understand much about the target audience or the retail business, but this business segment looks very strange to me as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This brings me to eBay Live in general and their version of “live shopping.” I couldn’t write about it without trying it myself, and maybe it was a mistake. I thought it was bad. Again, maybe I’m not their target audience, but if this is supposed to be their big innovation, then it’s underwhelming. Each live stream has 20-80 viewers, and I don’t think it looks like a future growth driver.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They said eBay Live’s GMV run rate grew 5x year-over-year, but I just don’t see it. Maybe the numbers were minuscule, and now they are slightly bigger. That would make more sense. Maybe it works better for collectibles, but even then, it just feels like the company is forcing itself into trends that don’t really fit its platform.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI Implementation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, the growth of the stock is directly correlated with the company's AI implementation. Here, I have some mixed feelings as well, because if I can relate to one part and justify the other, some of the developments that management is very vocal about don’t sound like something that will help this company in bringing in more clients or sales, for that matter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">eBay says it’s using AI for things like improving listings, powering recommendations, and even helping users search by photo. And while that all sounds nice, at the same time, it is not revolutionary. Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) has had image search for years, Pinterest, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PINS\" title=\"Pinterest, Inc.\">PINS</a>) has had visual search for years as well, and even when I knew it existed and tried it a few times, I never used it. So I am skeptical about the ability of this feature to attract more customers or to change the shopping experience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s good that they’re finding ways to integrate AI, but I wouldn’t call them an “AI-driven company” because of it. Most of what they’re doing with AI just helps with listing descriptions and better recommendations. It’s an incremental improvement, which is needed, of course, to go toe-to-toe with the times, but it’s not revolutionary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They also mentioned an AI shopping agent, an agentic commerce platform, and a large language model, or LLM, ecosystem. But again, that’s not something that will change how people perceive eBay. The only genuinely interesting feature, in my opinion, is that you can describe to AI what you’re searching for and get personalized product results. That could be useful, but I tried to find it myself on the website and couldn’t even locate the feature. Maybe it’s being tested in limited regions. So while I do think this is a smart direction, and I truly believe that in the future we’ll all shop by describing what we want to an AI assistant, I just don’t see eBay as the one leading that revolution.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mixed Feelings About the Business</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I can recognize what eBay is doing well, I’m skeptical about how valuable it really is long-term. Their results were good—GMV up 8%, revenue up 8%, EPS up 14%, and their advertising business grew 23%. But their gross margin keeps shrinking and is now at 71.6%, down from 72.4% last year and from around 77% just a few years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company looks healthy, but profitability is slowly eroding. They returned $760 million to shareholders this quarter through buybacks and dividends. This is great, but I am still not feeling like eBay is a great buying opportunity for me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Talking about the reasons for the stock drop, it’s mostly the fact that management said that the company may face headwinds for 2025 and 2026. They guided for fourth-quarter GMV growth of only 4%–6% (GMV in Q4 at $20.5 billion–$20.9 billion) and full-year GMV of ~5% growth. They flagged that last year’s trading cards and bullion surge created tough comparables, dragging future growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They also warned that elimination of the U.S. “de minimis” import exemption (meaning smaller cross-border parcels are now subject to tariffs) and other trade- and shipping-friction issues create structural headwinds for their cross-border business. Even though they say revenue and GMV will “grow positively,” the company admitted margin pressure will persist due to investments in shipping solutions, live commerce, and AI-agent platforms, plus interest expense drag from lower cash balances.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What’s also interesting is that despite all of this, the company still trades at a relatively high valuation compared to its own history. Its current P/E ratio is around 15x, while its 5-year average is closer to 12x. For a secondhand marketplace with declining margins, that doesn’t look like a stock at a meaningful discount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_92edb8e271a08a43be3d283a85496573.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_92edb8e271a08a43be3d283a85496573.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_92edb8e271a08a43be3d283a85496573.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_92edb8e271a08a43be3d283a85496573.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_92edb8e271a08a43be3d283a85496573.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_92edb8e271a08a43be3d283a85496573.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_92edb8e271a08a43be3d283a85496573.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_92edb8e271a08a43be3d283a85496573.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_92edb8e271a08a43be3d283a85496573.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So while eBay is performing well financially, I can’t say that I would buy the stock at these levels. It’s not an AI company, and it’s not the future of e-commerce. It’s a decent business that found some stable niches, but nothing that makes me think it will change the world. If nothing groundbreaking is happening, why would this stock trade at a much higher multiple?</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, to sum it up, I see the good, I see the effort, and I even see smart decisions. But I also see a company trying to present itself as something it’s not. And I just can’t convince myself that these “AI” features, or live shopping experiments, or trading cards, are the foundation of long-term value for eBay Inc. For me, this company is simply okay.</p>",

As discussed in our <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4809627-palantir-vs-navitas-diverging-fundamentals-converging-valuations\">previous coverage</a> on the stock, its valuation upsurge is not only a result of mere AI hype. Instead, it<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> reflects reward for Palantir’s consistent delivery of tangible progress in scaling profitability, as its Artificial Intelligence Platform (“AIP”) accelerates capitalization on emerging secular opportunities. This is corroborated by the company’s two consecutive quarters of raised full year 2025 revenue guidance, which now reflects </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4808502-palantir-technologies-inc-pltr-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">45% y/y growth</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> at the midpoint to $4.146 billion.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The recent <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-palantir-ai-enterprise-data-intelligence\" rel=\"nofollow\">partnership</a> to integrate AIP with Nvidia’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) tech stack has only reinforced optimism over Palantir’s AI monetization strategy. Momentum in the current quarter is also supported by Palantir’s increasing traction in government opportunities – especially in Europe, where accelerating adoption is helping narrow its international operations’ growth gap from core U.S. public sector opportunities. Specifically, U.S. government opportunities have been a key driver of Palantir’s acceleration this year, thanks to the favourable defense tech spending environment under the Trump administration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, the developments continue to bolster Palantir’s translation of imminent secular AI tailwinds into tangible demand visibility and scalability, underpinning durability to its valuation trajectory. The following analysis will explore defining questions that will drive Palantir’s upcoming Q3 earnings results—including the growth trajectory that the market is pricing into Palantir’s 268x estimated earnings multiple, and whether its execution across the commercial and government segments is consistent with those expectations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>What Does The Market Expect From Palantir? </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following its eye-watering upsurge this year, the stock’s become one of the most expensive at 268x estimated earnings and 98x estimated sales. Within the software peer group, Clearwater Analytics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CWAN\" title=\"Clearwater Analytics Holdings, Inc.\">CWAN</a>) has the most comparable forward growth outlook (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CWAN/earnings/estimates\">2025E</a>: +61% y/y; 2026E: +30% y/y) to Palantir (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR/earnings/estimates\">2025E</a>: +45% y/y; 2026E: +35% y/y). Yet Clearwater Analytics trades at a much lower multiple of 31x forward earnings and 6x forward sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main difference is in the durability of their respective multi-year growth and earnings accretion trajectories. Clearwater Analytics’ growth outlook is expected to decelerate into the high-teens percentage range by 2027, representing a 19% five-year CAGR through 2030. This compares with Palantir’s 36% five-year CAGR over the same period based on current consensus estimates. Meanwhile, Clearwater Analytics’ earnings outlook, though robust, also pales in comparison to Palantir’s. The company is expected to expand earnings at a 24% five-year CAGR through 2030, versus Palantir’s 35% over the same period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This accordingly highlights the market’s optimism for Palantir’s unmatched scalability, which is critical for cash flow accretion underpinning the stock’s valuation outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To further gauge the durability of Palantir’s premium valuation multiple given its current estimates, we’ve also performed a reverse discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis. This is performed to gauge whether the pace of revenue and earnings growth predictions are supportive of an intrinsic value that aligns with Palantir’s current valuation multiple premium on a relative basis to peers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similar to our <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4809627-palantir-vs-navitas-diverging-fundamentals-converging-valuations\">last</a> reverse DCF analysis performed on the stock, key valuation assumptions considered include a perpetual growth rate of 3.5% applied on projected 2035 cash flow to firm (i.e., EBITDA + change in net working capital + cash taxes) in determining Palantir’s terminal value. The perpetual growth rate of 3.5% is in line with the anticipated pace of long-term economic expansion across Palantir’s core operating regions (i.e., U.S. and allied regions). This accordingly reflects the rate at which its steady-state cash flows – which is proxied by 2035 projections consistent with the anticipated timeline to a mature business cycle – can sustainably expand at over the longer-term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reverse DCF analysis also considers a 9.0% WACC, which is used to discount the cash flow projections and estimated terminal value over a 10-year forecast period to determine Palantir’s enterprise value. Net debt – which in Palantir’s case is its cash balance due to nil borrowings – is added back to arrive at its equity value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming Palantir maintains a similar pace of quarterly margin expansion as observed over the past two years, underpinned by AIP’s rapid scalability alongside complementary improvements to operating leverage, the stock’s current price at ~$195 per share (October 30 close) implies a multi-year revenue and earnings growth trajectory of at least 35% and 44%, respectively:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"286\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Palantir valuation analysis\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"195\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-1761913265582996_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

This corroborates that Palantir’s premium valuation multiple on a relative basis to peers is currently supported by the intrinsic value of its cash flow projections.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Is This Multi-Year Growth Trajectory Supported By Recent Developments?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We believe the recent developments at Palantir reinforce demand visibility that corroborates current growth estimates underpinning its valuation, both on a relative (i.e. multiple-based) and intrinsic (i.e., DCF) basis:</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>Palantir Integration With Nvidia Tech Stack</em></strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earlier this week, Palantir announced that its proprietary Ontology – the digital replica of an organization that underpins Foundry, Gotham, and AIP’s insight-driving capabilities – will integrate Nvidia’s AI tech stack. This will allow Ontology access to Nvidia’s AI models and accelerated compute power to further address enterprise AI needs, and bolster Palantir’s penetration into related commercial opportunities – especially in the industrial vertical, given their complex supply chains and need for dynamic systems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, the industrial vertical is inherently low-margin due to its capital intensity. Yet AI is able to <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/customer-stories/siemens-accelerates-product-development-and-innovation-with-industrial-ai/?ncid=pa-srch-goog-707332&amp;_bt=771598777624&amp;_bk=industrial%20digitalization&amp;_bm=p&amp;_bn=g&amp;_bg=185377347740&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22958834872&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD4XAoHES2kOH6uqpqN9_QY0dZ-ww&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwmYzIBhC6ARIsAHA3IkTiyt6cAV5HvemPA8WM435M14ujooAFTaEtuvZXp6RiV5qZAtF6AkcaAm2IEALw_wcB\" rel=\"nofollow\">unlock</a> greater product efficiency and better decision-making, enabling productivity gains (e.g., reduced downtime; supply chain optimization) that can have a tangible impact on industrials’ scalability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This accordingly makes industrials a key emerging vertical for AI application. As part of a recent industry survey, only about 21% of respondents have cited adoption of industrial AI solutions, while almost half expect implementation over the next three years, driven by supply chain optimization needs. The emerging opportunity is also consistent with current <a href=\"https://iot-analytics.com/industrial-ai-market-insights-how-ai-is-transforming-manufacturing/\" rel=\"nofollow\">industry estimates</a> for the industrial AI market opportunity to exceed $150 billion in value by 2030, representing a 23% CAGR from about $44 billion in 2024. This accordingly highlights the significant growth headroom for Palantir’s commercial AIP monetization in the industrial vertical. And the recent collaboration with Nvidia is expected to further Palantir’s reach into said opportunity, as it’s expected to unlock further optimization critical for the industrial end-market. It’s also expected to complement Palantir’s <a href=\"https://www.palantir.com/warpspeed/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Warp Speed</a> operating system optimized for manufacturing and industrial verticals, which further reinforces its longer-term commercial demand visibility.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>Expanding Europe Footprint</em></strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The U.K. has been consistently a key growth driver for Palantir’s international business – especially in public sector opportunities in recent quarters. And recent developments are expected to further expand Palantir’s international government momentum, as it bolsters reach into additional European opportunities:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>£1.5 Billion U.K. Investment: </strong>Earlier last month, Palantir announced its pledge of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-strategic-partnership-to-unlock-billions-and-boost-military-ai-and-innovation\" rel=\"nofollow\">£1.5 billion</a> towards U.K. investments by 2030, targeting the development of next-generation AI defense technologies. It’s also been awarded a £750 million, five-year contract with the U.K. Ministry of Defense to deploy its proprietary AI-enabled defense technology. This is expected to extend the company’s current momentum in the region’s public sector opportunities, and drive further accretion to government segment growth.</li> <li> <strong>Hadean Partnership: </strong>Palantir announced its <a href=\"https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2025/Palantir-and-Hadean-Partner-to-Bring-a-Suite-of-Simulation-and-AI-Products-Across-the-UK-Armed-Forces/\" rel=\"nofollow\">partnership</a> with Hadean, a leading U.K. defense tech provider, earlier this month. The collaboration is expected to further Palantir’s share of defense AI tech spend in the region beyond direct engagements acquired through U.K. Ministry of Defense contracts.</li> <li> <strong>Letter of Intent with Poland Ministry of National Defense: </strong>Palantir and Poland’s Defense Ministry has signed a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-27/poland-signs-palantir-anduril-deals-amid-record-army-spending\" rel=\"nofollow\">letter of intent</a> earlier this week to support the agency’s expansion of its data, AI, and cybersecurity capabilities. This accordingly reinforces Palantir’s foray in Europe public sector opportunities—a region that CEO Alex Karp has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4781960-palantir-technologies-inc-pltr-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">long criticized</a> for its slow development and adoption of AI software. Specifically, Poland is expecting $55 billion in defense spending next year, which represents 5% of its GDP – the <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/05/polands-president-vows-to-spend-47-of-gdp-on-defence-this-year\" rel=\"nofollow\">largest</a> allocation among NATO constituents.</li> <li> <strong>NATO Adoption of Maven Smart System: </strong>Earlier this year, NATO <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/02/05/polands-president-vows-to-spend-47-of-gdp-on-defence-this-year\" rel=\"nofollow\">adopted</a> Palantir’s proprietary Maven Smart System. This represents a critical “landing” deal for Palantir, as it gains access to “deploy its AI mission command solution across [NATO’s] 32 member states.” True to Palantir’s “land and expand” business model, the NATO partnership is a critical step towards further penetration of opportunities across Europe, and increased visibility into its international government segment’s long-term growth trajectory. This was likely a precursor to the recent letter of intent signed with Poland, signaling confidence in continued adoption of Palantir’s defense tech offerings among U.S. allies in Europe.</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>U.S. Policy Support</em></strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Palantir has emerged as one of the leading defense tech firms as the U.S. Army undergoes modernization. This has been further bolstered by the Trump administration’s policy support. Specifically, the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text\" rel=\"nofollow\">One Big Beautiful Act Bill</a> now includes significant allocations towards defense spending, with “<a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/will-trumps-big-beautiful-defense-spending-last\" rel=\"nofollow\">tens of billions of dollars</a> in funding for innovation priorities.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recent commentary from the U.S. Army Chief Information Officer, Leonel Garciga, has also reaffirmed Palantir’s “foundational” role in the agency’s AI strategy:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>Palantir is a core platform for business capabilities and readiness right now, to lay the foundation for some of the AI work that we want to do across the Army.</p> <p><em>Source: U.S. Army CIO Leonel Garciga, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-03/palantir-rebuts-claims-of-security-flaws-after-stock-falls\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bloomberg News</a></em></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This accordingly creates a favourable backdrop for Palantir, as long-term U.S. government opportunities represent a key growth driver for the business. The company’s increasingly entrenched role in bolstering the U.S. Army’s AI ecosystem is also expected to complement its moat in defense tech, and reinforce its reach into international opportunities among allied regions.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>Resilient Enterprise AI Software Spending</em></strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Palantir’s U.S. commercial operations represent its leading growth driver. The unit delivered 93% y/y revenue growth in Q2, complemented by continued acceleration in commercial-driven remaining performance obligations at 77% y/y growth during the period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This accordingly provides strong accretion required to maintain the 36%+ multi-year growth trajectory currently priced into Palantir’s valuation. And the momentum is expected to stay resilient, given strong indicators of enterprise AI software spending ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A recent <a href=\"https://www.rbcinsight.com/WM/share/ResearchViewer/?YYY340_a0lQ3LRaZh+1NpNJQbmxHwVAUZMEcrwPLGtNKcq+bZcVRjN4GR75hg==&amp;a=a\" rel=\"nofollow\">CIO survey</a> conducted by RBC Capital Markets shows that software will represent the bulk of near-term IT budgets. Almost all surveyed respondents have indicated expectations for increased software spend through the year, with the majority of allocations designated towards “AI and cybersecurity, followed by Data Warehouse, Analytics, and BI and Database and IT Service Management software” – a strong tailwind for Palantir as it continues to scale AIP deployment in the commercial sector:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"752\" data-height=\"496\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph with numbers and percentagesAI-generated content may be incorrect.\" width=\"640\" height=\"422\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/53884093-17619005422343414_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>RBC Capital Markets</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>What Can Go Wrong?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looming macroeconomic uncertainties remain the key overhang for Palantir, as it directly interferes with the enterprise IT spending environment. However, as discussed in the earlier section, AI spending – which Palantir is a key beneficiary of – remains resilient. This is further reinforced by AI-promised productivity gains, which can help businesses – particularly those in capital-intensive industrial and manufacturing verticals – preserve margins amid adverse cost pressures stemming from ongoing tariff uncertainties.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another downside risk facing Palantir is its increasing exposure to political controversies. For instance, the company has been outspoken about its support for Israel amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza. It’s also played a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ice-palantir-immigrationos/\" rel=\"nofollow\">key role</a> in supporting the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration crackdown efforts. Both of which have been controversial topics in which Americans have been divided on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the latest development, Palantir’s Head of Global Communications, Lisa Gordon, has also <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/palantir-trump-karp-politics.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">identified</a> the company’s “political shift toward the Trump administration [as] concerning”. From an operating perspective, this could risk boycotts and lead to adverse implications on its commercial segment growth outlook. Similar challenges have been recently observed at companies like <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2025/10/27/elon-musks-politics-cost-tesla-over-1-million-sales-us-study/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tesla</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA\" title=\"Tesla, Inc.\">TSLA</a>), <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/oct/02/elon-musk-netflix-trans-character-dead-end-paranormal-park\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netflix</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX\" title=\"Netflix, Inc.\">NFLX</a>) and <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-suffers-concerning-loss-massive-013700303.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Disney</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>), as their political views conflict with demand drivers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, there is tangible support for Palantir’s current valuation, despite the significant premium on a relative basis to peers. Recent developments – spanning the integration of AIP with Nvidia’s AI tech stack, accelerating adoption across U.S. and international governments, and resilient enterprise software spending allocations – reinforce visibility into Palantir’s multi-year, high growth trajectory, which strengthens its prospects for sustained margin expansion at scale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, the company’s expanding collaborations with U.S. allies, such as NATO, alongside its deepening partnerships with enterprise leaders further skew its opportunities to the upside. Not only do these newly secured relationships represent standalone opportunities, but they also provide validation to Palantir’s technologies, and signal incremental avenues for growth expansion and market share penetration headroom – aligning closely with its land-and-expand business model.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Coupled with resilience in the enterprise IT spending environment, alongside favourable policy support for defense tech modernization, Palantir enters its upcoming Q3 earnings update in a position of strength. Fundamentally, the company also continues to deliver tangible financial progress, underpinned by consistent revenue acceleration and operating leverage improvements. This accordingly enhances durability to its valuation trajectory, while keeping investors’ optimism over the company’s long-term AI moat intact.</p>",

There’s one more big headline<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> this week worth paying attention to: the shareholder vote on CoreWeave, Inc.’s (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWV\" title=\"CoreWeave, Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">CRWV</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) acquisition of Core Scientific, Inc. (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CORZ\" title=\"Core Scientific, Inc.\">CORZ</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consistent with our expectations, CoreWeave <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511462-core-scientific-fails-to-get-enough-votes-for-coreweave-deal\">did not receive</a> the requisite number of votes for the acquisition to pass. The stock gained over 6% on the news, intra-trading on Thursday. The failed acquisition isn't all that surprising, given the trajectory of events heading into Thursday's vote, with proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS advising against it (reports that CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator called it disappointing). We think this is the best thing that could've happened to Core Scientific and see a big opportunity in Core Scientific on its fall-through.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Details of CoreWeave’s $9B bid for Core Scientific &amp; why today's news is good:</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CoreWeave, Wall Street’s favorite neocloud baby, announced back in June its intention to acquire Core Scientific in a $9B all-stock deal. Upon closing, Core Scientific stockholders would receive 0.1235 newly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4507210-coreweave-ceo-calls-on-core-scientific-shareholders-to-back-acquisition-under-current-terms\">issued</a> shares of CoreWeave Class A common stock. Back in June, neither stock reacted well to the news, with CoreWeave dropping 3% and Core Scientific pulling back 18%. The less-than-impressed reaction was not on the acquisition itself as much as it was about the $9B price tag, undervaluing Core Scientific and working more in favor of CoreWeave, plus concerns over ownership dilution with more shares. The deal would shave off $10B in future lease obligations for CoreWeave, according to the acquisition presentation. The way CoreWeave CEO put it: “We’re not paying rent, right, for the next 15 years.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For reference, CoreWeave is already Core Scientific's largest customer, so CoreWeave would essentially be buying its landlord, saving on rent for years to come. So, CoreWeave would be securing an AI fuel line that’ll enable it to enter more lease agreements, similar to the $14B AI infrastructure deal we saw with Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) last month. It would also be a relatively easy way for CoreWeave to secure extra capacity without high cost; in fact, Core Scientific’s vertical integration is expected to result in $500M in annual cost savings by the end of 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This wouldn’t be too bad of a setup, if not for the fact that Core Scientific’s external opportunity is outpacing the one associated with this deal. Core Scientific sits on approximately 1.3 GW of gross power capacity, of which 840 MW is allocated to CoreWeave and 250 MW of billable IT capacity remains available, with potential expansion for an additional 1 GW. In comparison, Applied Digital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APLD\" title=\"Applied Digital Corporation\">APLD</a>) has about 800 MW across Polaris Forge 1 and 2, and is already leasing out capacity within the development pipeline. The capacity Core Scientific has is notable and has been overshadowed by acquisition concerns this year. We expect investors to recognize Core Scientific's standalone potential now that the deal is off the table, as there is greater value in its uncontracted power capacity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Core Scientific also reported its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4508526-core-scientific-gaap-eps-of-0_46-misses-by-0_43-revenue-of-81_1m\">Q3 '25 results</a> during the week, with revenue of $81.1M, up from $78.6M last quarter but down from $95.4M in the year-ago quarter, with a contracted net loss of $146.7M versus $455.3M in the year-ago quarter. Gross profit was $3.9M, up from a loss of $0.2M a year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We think the top line isn’t moving due to the weight of the shift to high-density colocation business (HPC hosting or HDC), allocating more capacity to HPC over mining bitcoin. This quarter, the bitcoin mined dropped 55%, and the average bitcoin price (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD\" title=\"Bitcoin USD\">BTC-USD</a>) increased 88%. HDC sales were up 45.6% Q/Q to $10.3M, while bitcoin-mining business sales were $66.1M, down 22% Y/Y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market didn’t react too well to the results, but we believe they confirm that management is continuing the push toward AI infrastructure leasing and away from bitcoin. The only concern we have is about the trajectory of CapEx if the acquisition does not go through, considering that $196.4 of the $244.5 was funded by CoreWeave. What eases our concern is that we don't see CoreWeave stepping back from funding the shift toward HDC, considering it remains reliant on Core Scientific capacity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our thesis on Core Scientific isn’t risk-free. This could place risk on their future positioning with CoreWeave, although that cannot be proved or disproved this early. What we do know is that CoreWeave is likely already looking for another bitcoin mining turned AI infrastructure play to buy because the cost of converting a cryptocurrency site is lower than setting up a whole new campus. We expect shareholders will focus less on Intrator and more on Core Scientific’s standalone potential value.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation is cheap compared to the potential premium</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The digital infrastructure landlord scene has evolved very quickly, and it’s looking more attractive for Core Scientific to join its bitcoin mining-turned-AI infrastructure peer group in the opportunity of securing lease agreements beyond CoreWeave. The results of Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) and Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) after the bell on Wednesday confirm that CapEx spend focused on AI build-out is expanding, and Core Scientific is uniquely positioned to benefit as an unrealized, high-capacity option. Applied Digital and IREN (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IREN\" title=\"IREN Limited\">IREN</a>), for example, are monetizing the opportunity, building out capacity, and the stock price is reflecting it, as shown below, while Core Scientific is underperforming the peer group.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261524581227.png?io=w640\" alt=\"sklfjdsljf\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"507\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261524581227.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261524581227.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261524581227.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261524581227.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261524581227.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261524581227.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261524581227.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261524581227.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCharts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Core Scientific stock has run up recently to its 52-week high on the deal's failure, hitting $22.12 per share. RSI is almost 69, heading toward overbought territory. Valuation-wise, the stock remains attractive in our opinion. The stock trades at a forward EV/Sales of 17.93x against a group average of 3.61x, which looks high at first until checking the more direct peer group, shown below on the six-month chart. Core Scientific’s premium is arguably negligible against the premium it could go into if it realizes more lease agreements on its power potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261525402122.png?io=w640\" alt=\"kasldfjskld\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"490\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261525402122.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261525402122.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261525402122.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261525402122.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261525402122.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261525402122.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261525402122.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62967154-17618261525402122.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCharts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line:</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a kind of caterpillar turning into a butterfly scenario, and we’re here at the right time. Core Scientific has ample opportunity to lease more capacity and expand its operations. We see substantial upside for Core Scientific on Thursday's rejection, and hence we are initiating coverage on Core Scientific with a Buy.</p>",
