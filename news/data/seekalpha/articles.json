October is typically the month when companies adjust<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> prices. A 0.6% month-on-month, seasonally adjusted, increase suggests businesses are raising final prices in response to input price hikes. Prices increased for both goods (0.9%) and services (0.4%), with notable gains in labour-intensive sectors like transport, communication, and entertainment.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bank of Japan views this as evidence that sustainable wage growth is driving prices higher. Meanwhile, food prices rose, but at a slower pace. Utilities prices jumped as government subsidies ended. We expect core CPI to remain around 2.5% by the end of this year, backed by solid wage growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Takaichi government plans to fight inflation by reducing the gasoline tax and offering temporary discounts on winter power and gas bills. This may lower headline inflation early next year.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tokyo CPI rose stronger than expected in October</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"844\" data-height=\"402\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Tokyo CPI rose stronger than expected in October\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"305\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618882006449325_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: CEIC</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"677\" data-height=\"164\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Industrial production (%MoM)\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"155\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55028208-17618881525160787_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Industrial output rebounded stronger than expected 2.2% MoM sa in September, for the first time in three months</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Industrial production decreased by 0.1% quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter, primarily due to reductions in output related to US tariffs. Transportation equipment and iron/steel output declined in September, likely due to the lingering effects of US tariffs. Still, the recent easing of tariff tensions in several countries should support Japan's production rebound in the coming months. Semiconductor equipment sales rose for a second consecutive month, suggesting that strong global chip demand continued. Meanwhile, retail sales rebounded 0.3% MoM in September but missed the market consensus of 0.8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both IP and retail sales fell in Q3, indicating a GDP contraction for 3Q25. However, a rebound in September points to a gradual economic recovery in the current quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The BoJ cited trade uncertainty as the reason for pausing rate hikes yesterday. However, today’s data indicates a possible economic recovery that could support future rate hikes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today’s data supports our view that the BoJ is likely to hike rates in December.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Take, for example, the consistently increasing margins of WSO for the last many years. This speaks volumes about the quality of WSO’s business and its industry positioning. No doubt things will remain good for WSO for quite some time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But WSO’s current valuations leave little room for investors to benefit from this great business, especially after considering near-term external industry-related demand headwinds that WSO currently faces, which were evident in WSO's recent quarterly results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the recent fall in the stock price of WSO has made it cheaper, I am still not convinced with the valuation that the company commands despite its superior business. On top of this, the near-term headwind also provides a reason to not own this stock at the current point and valuation and to wait for a better entry. Therefore, I am reiterating my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4789844-watsco-reiterating-hold-rating-on-accounts-of-hefty-valuations\">previous</a> hold (neutral) rating on the stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Weaker topline marred by external headwinds</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earlier this week, WSO reported its third quarter 2025 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510155-watsco-gaap-eps-of-3_98-misses-by-0_31-revenue-of-2_07b-misses-by-70m\">results</a>, which were quite disappointing. The company missed both top- and bottom-line estimates, reporting revenue of $2.07 billion, missing the estimates by $70 million, while GAAP EPS remained at $3.98, which also missed by a wide margin of $0.31.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">WSO has had back to back two disappointing results. The 2Q 2025 results were quite bad, primarily due to an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806320-watsco-inc-wso-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">uneven</a> heating pattern where recooling days appeared during the peak heat period (May-June) of the year. While the management also mentioned macroeconomic headwinds from weaker consumer sentiments as another driver of the weak results, this headwind was largely overlooked by many given the large impact of the weather-related headwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the third quarter too, WSO witnessed macroeconomic headwinds from weaker consumer sentiment. In fact, the severity of this headwind is much more intense now than it was in the second quarter. The University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Index has consistently been trending lower since the start of the year, with a brief uptick prior to the 2Q25 earnings announcement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1484\" data-height=\"910\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"University of Michigan Consumer Setiment Index\" width=\"640\" height=\"392\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158041782167_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>University of Michigan Consumer <span></span></span>Sentiment<span> Index</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The weak consumer confidence is further exacerbated by the repeated price hikes taken by the HVAC OEMs over the last couple of years, with the latest <a href=\"https://gopaschal.com/resources/2025-hvac-price-increases/\" rel=\"nofollow\">one</a> of mid- to high single digits announced prior to this year. Combining the repeated price hikes and weak consumer sentiment, the consumer has shown a broad trend of trading down to the base models rather than going with a more premium option.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, the weak residential construction demand has also proved to be a considerable headwind for the company. While the size of new construction's contribution to overall revenue (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4822361-watsco-inc-wso-presents-at-morgan-stanleys-13th-annual-laguna-conference-transcript\">15-20%</a>) is not as significant as replacement demand, the significant drop in residential demand took a toll on overall revenue growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going forward the outlook for industry demand looks grim; I expect the external environment to remain somewhat challenging with consumer sentiment still depressed. Furthermore, demand from residential construction is also expected to remain <a href=\"https://www.kiplinger.com/economic-forecasts/housing\" rel=\"noopener\">weak</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability a bright spot</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the revenue growth was not up to the mark, WSO's continues to report good margins, with gross margins improving ~150 bps YoY to 27.5%. The improvements were primarily due to the carryover price hike benefit from the price increases made by OEM in spring this year, as old inventory purchased before the price hikes was sold during the quarter. Going forward, I believe this benefit should fade away from next quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, one should take note of the gradual improvement that the company has made in its margins over the last many years. The gross as well as operating profit margins have expanded considerably over the last 4-5 years when inflation and price hikes were intense. This shows WSO’s pricing power against a highly fragmented consumer base and cost efficiency against smaller peers (WSO is the largest HVAC distributor in a highly fragmented industry).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1284\" data-height=\"890\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"WSO's Margins\" width=\"640\" height=\"444\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61640001-17618158061254873_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>YCharts</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going forward, in the near term I do not expect any meaningful change in gross margins. For the medium to long term, WSO is set to continue its last 4-5 years' trend of gradual gross margin improvement. WSO’s management has set an ambitious <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806320-watsco-inc-wso-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">target</a> of achieving a gross margin of over 30% from the current floor gross margin of 27% under the “Dream Plan 2”.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 30% gross margin seems quite achievable, as some of WSO’s units already operate at gross margins above 30%, so replicating that across the business should be possible. Furthermore, technology such as Pricefx as well as a higher share of non-equipment segment (30-40% gross margin), should also benefit the margins going forward. Pricefx is a proprietary technology developed by WSO to manage dynamic pricing with specified floor and ceiling prices across the company, serving 100K contractors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As per management, they have been using this technology for the last 2-3 years, and they are “still younger in that journey.” This implies that there is more to come with respect to harnessing the benefit of dynamic pricing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Better Cash flow to aid growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The transition from 410A products to A2L products had been quite a stress on WSO’s balance sheet, as the company had to stock both older 410A products as well as A2L products at the same time. This led much of the capital to tie up with the increased inventory investment. Now, as the transition has been largely complete, the inventory turnover has started to improve from the 3Q 2025.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p>Quarter</p></td> <td><p>Revenue (USD millions)</p></td> <td><p>Inventory (USD millions)</p></td> <td><p>Inventory turnover ratio (not annualized)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Sep 2025</p></td> <td><p>2,067.00</p></td> <td><p>1,601.78</p></td> <td><p>1.29</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Jun 2025</p></td> <td><p>2,062.40</p></td> <td><p>1,952.80</p></td> <td><p>1.06</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Mar 2025</p></td> <td><p>1,531.10</p></td> <td><p>1,776.10</p></td> <td><p>0.86</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Dec 2024</p></td> <td><p>1,754.00</p></td> <td><p>1,385.40</p></td> <td><p>1.27</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Sep 2024</p></td> <td><p>2,160.00</p></td> <td><p>1,596.80</p></td> <td><p>1.35</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Jun 2024</p></td> <td><p>2,139.30</p></td> <td><p>1,573.50</p></td> <td><p>1.36</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Mar 2024</p></td> <td><p>1,565.00</p></td> <td><p>1,655.60</p></td> <td><p>0.95</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Dec 2023</p></td> <td><p>1,603.20</p></td> <td><p>1,347.30</p></td> <td><p>1.19</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Sep 2023</p></td> <td><p>2,126.80</p></td> <td><p>1,549.70</p></td> <td><p>1.37</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Jun 2023</p></td> <td><p>2,003.10</p></td> <td><p>1,689.30</p></td> <td><p>1.19</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Mar 2023</p></td> <td><p>1,550.60</p></td> <td><p>1,614.30</p></td> <td><p>0.96</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Dec 2022</p></td> <td><p>1,581.20</p></td> <td><p>1,370.20</p></td> <td><p>1.15</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Source: Author, Seeking Alpha</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This has freed up the excess cash tied up with the inventory, which has made WSO’s balance sheet even healthier. Now, given management's stance of favoring inorganic expansion over share repurchases, I believe one could assume a few M&amp;As going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I usually like share repurchases over any M&amp;As, in the case of WSO, I believe M&amp;A is a better choice for better shareholder returns. First, I believe WSO is currently overvalued, and share repurchases done at expensive valuations often lead to value destruction rather than creation. And second, WSO works in a highly fragmented HVAC distribution industry; being the largest player, WSO enjoys an economy of scale like no other competitor enjoys. This makes WSO a good platform company for bolt-on acquisitions of smaller competitors, which not only increase WSO’s scale and pricing power but also make the newly acquired company more efficient, benefiting WSO in the form of synergies.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation and conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I last rated WSO a hold, particularly due to its expensive valuations, and since then the stock has corrected considerably. However, even now the stock is trading at ~27.8x forward non-GAAP PE ratio, which seems to be quite expensive when compared to the historical range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even when compared to peers, WSO appears to be quite expensive. While WSO has a lower non-GAAP forward PE ratio than the peer average, its growth rate is quite lower than the peer average. Even more so, WSO has the lowest growth rate among its peers. While I do believe WSO has superior business fundamentals, the valuation gap, when viewed in conjunction with growth potential, offers little upside from here.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p>Company Name</p></td> <td><p>Ticker</p></td> <td><p>Fwd PE ratio</p></td> <td><p>Average growth FY25-FY27</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Watsco, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WSO\" title=\"Watsco, Inc.\">WSO</a>)</p></td> <td><p>27.5</p></td> <td><p>5.87%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Peer Average</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>30.31</p></td> <td><p>18.62%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>QXO, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QXO\" title=\"QXO, Inc.\">QXO</a>)</p></td> <td><p>49.97</p></td> <td><p>65.77%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>WESCO International, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WCC\" title=\"WESCO International, Inc.\">WCC</a>)</p></td> <td><p>15.80</p></td> <td><p>14.66%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Core &amp; Main, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNM\" title=\"Core &amp; Main, Inc.\">CNM</a>)</p></td> <td><p>38.58</p></td> <td><p>11.77%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Applied Industrial Technologies</p></td> <td><p>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AIT\" title=\"Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.\">AIT</a>)</p></td> <td><p>23.88</p></td> <td><p>7.88%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Trane Technologies plc</p></td> <td><p>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TT\" title=\"Trane Technologies plc\">TT</a>)</p></td> <td><p>32.93</p></td> <td><p>14.07%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Lennox International Inc.</p></td> <td><p>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LII\" title=\"Lennox International Inc.\">LII</a>)</p></td> <td><p>27.99</p></td> <td><p>6.23%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Carrier Global Corp</p></td> <td><p>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CARR\" title=\"Carrier Global Corporation\">CARR</a>)</p></td> <td><p>23.01</p></td> <td><p>9.94%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Source: Author, Seeking Alpha</em></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, the near-term industry headwinds make me even more skeptical about its near-term potential as an investment.

Until then, I reiterate the hold (neutral) rating on the stock.</p>",

Additionally, inflation came in hotter, bringing the 10-year inflation swap a tick closer to the 2% target again. We acknowledge that the upside potential for euro rates remains limited this year, and we target a 10-year rate of some 10 basis points above the current 2.65%. With growth on track to improve further in 2026, that’s when we aim for the 10Y to look at 3% as the new equilibrium.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the front end, the wiggle room is much more limited as the ECB’s mantra of being “in a good place” is set on repeat. That means that the 2Y swap rate is firmly anchored between 2.1% and 2.2%. The rise in longer-dated yields must therefore come from steeper curves. That steepening faces resistance from the US, however, where 10Y UST yields dove from 4.5% to 4.0% over the past months. As 10-year US rates stabilise, or even rise as we predict, the 2s10s of the euro curve should feel more comfortable steepening.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dutch pension reforms too complex to push for steeper 10s30s by itself</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Besides US spillovers, we have flattening pressures from the very long end to deal with, whereby the 10s30s steepener seems to have come to a halt. The 10s30s dynamics this year have been almost entirely dictated by the US, but Dutch pension reforms may also play a role. While we still anticipate significant unwinds of 30Y futures and bonds starting in January, we feel the trade may have become too crowded over the summer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Estimating the timing and size of the flows stemming from the pension reforms is extremely complex, if not impossible, given the available data. Each fund of the 30 scheduled to transition on 1 January 2026 has a unique maturity profile and hedging strategy. Additionally, we remain concerned that IT problems could result in last-minute delays. And now that the US macro landscape is less supportive of 10s30s steepeners, we understand that the trade has become less attractive from a risk-reward perspective.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">US Treasuries continue to trade heavily post-FOMC</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the dust settles following Wednesday's Federal Open Market Committee outcome, the new levels for the 2-year and 10-year combo are 3.6% and 4.1%, respectively (both up 10 basis points). The net feeling centers on a Fed Chair that has no problem leaving the funds rate unchanged at the December meeting if that is deemed the thing to do. It comes with residual comfort in the economy. The fact that a 4.3% unemployment rate was specifically referenced as \"low\" amplifies this point. Instead, there is a degree of discomfort with inflation running at 3% and likely heading higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, there has not been a material change in the ultimate landing level for the funds rate. It's now slightly above 3%, but still within the 3% range. And the 5yr rate continues to trade below the straight line that can be drawn between the 2yr and 10yr rates in a steady fashion. This signals an unwavering expectation that the Fed is, in fact, far from done — it's just a matter of timing. The question now is how robust (or not) the economy manages to be in the next month or so<strong>. </strong>Yields may continue to push higher—particularly for longer maturities—despite the current pause. However, the lack of hard data remains a challenge due to the ongoing government shutdown. It is an opportunity for the 10yr yield to have a go at testing higher. It might not go too far, but there is a data vacuum that can be filled in, at least until we gain more clarity.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Friday's events and market views</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We start with eurozone inflation numbers. The headline French CPI number is expected to come in at just 0.9% year-on-year, a tick below the 1.1% from September. Italian inflation is also expected to nudge lower, from 1.8% YoY to 1.6%. This would then help the eurozone aggregate core CPI down from 2.4% YoY to 2.3%. Due to the US government shutdown, we only expect the Market News International (MNI) Chicago PMI to stand out as notable data.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

In one word: in my opinion, “dynamism.” In a highly segmented market like income investing, actively managed ETFs can shape asset allocation according to their market view, achieving a better Sharpe ratio (higher returns, lower volatility). Need to know more? Here’s a detailed view on FLXR.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What is it?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FLXR is an active <a href=\"https://www.tcw.com/Products/ETFs/FLXR?sc_lang=it\" rel=\"nofollow\">multi-sector fixed income</a> ETF, with the primary objective of generating high current income and a secondary one of maintaining long-term capital appreciation. The fund achieves this through active management, with an expense ratio of 0.40%, a 30-day average spread of 0.05%, and a high turnover ratio reported by SA of 181%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"951\" data-height=\"334\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FLXR - Profile\" width=\"640\" height=\"225\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728304578385_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">FLXR - Profile <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is the point of reference for the management and the index used in the comparison metrics.

The reason? The management is opportunistic. If I could describe it in one word, after reading <a href=\"https://www.tcw.com/-/media/Downloads/com/Products/ETFs/Commentary/FLXR-Performance-Commentary.PDF?rev=a0649fceec534310b1b67932a832ef2c&amp;hash=32DA5E6269E76D6DD438AA5639791DFC\" rel=\"nofollow\">TCW’s market comments</a>, I would define it as “counter-cyclical.” In the sense that the opportunistic approach lies in entering the market gradually when the opportunity arises. Seen this way, the underweight in HY and corporate components, and the overweight in short-duration and securitized assets, is justified by the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830794-paaa-defensive-yield-in-uncertain-times\">bear steepening</a> process of the yield curve and the expectation of more favorable spreads. But note, not by chance, during the panic sell in April, when spreads widened, TCW increased FLXR’s exposure to HY (even if only as a minor tactical adjustment). And that’s exactly what one looks for in active management.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"757\" data-height=\"261\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FLXR - Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"221\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-1761728900692706_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">FLXR - Chart <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A personal opinion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This gives FLXR some interesting characteristics from a portfolio integration perspective.

An element that, note well, does not depend on a higher yield. Rather a greater exposure to a segment that has managed to stand out and suffer less from the weight of the steepening: the MBS. And I think this is the biggest difference among this category of ETFs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This however leads me to also look towards other MBS-centric solutions. And I select two funds that I have analyzed in the past: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805120-jmtg-the-new-but-dated-solution-on-mbs-that-you-need-to-know\">JMTG</a> and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4807681-smbs-what-you-need-to-know-about-this-passive-mbs-etf\">SMBS</a>. The presence of other markets inside FLXR gives it higher yield, while the YTD comparison with SMBS is equal in total return. It will be curious to see if FLXR will be able to maintain alpha, considering that it still has a higher expense ratio than these hybrid or passive solutions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"942\" data-height=\"605\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FLXR - JMTG - SMBS: profile\" width=\"640\" height=\"411\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-176172919494722_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">FLXR - JMTG - SMBS: profile <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I look directly at the MBS, ABS and CMBS segment which today represent on average between 35% and 45% of the portfolio (as well as the main driver of extra yield compared to the Agg).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1301\" data-height=\"294\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FLXR - holding breakdown\" width=\"640\" height=\"145\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58581242-17617292994798977_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">FLXR - holding breakdown <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Curious how these assets are only and exclusively associated with something risky after the 2008 crisis, while here the message that comes through is MBS as a defensive pillar and yield driver. Someone might raise an eyebrow… And it is a topic I have talked about in detail also in other coverages (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821859-jbbb-clo-etf-yield-that-sparks-debate-today\">read here</a>), yet I find myself quite in line also in this case with the management. Of course the risk is clear: in case of systemic shocks, these less liquid assets <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4828036-cloz-and-the-real-risk-of-bbb-tranches\">suddenly widen the spreads</a>, leading to marked differences between NAV and fair value. And personally, I have some concerns regarding the<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834161-bizd-the-great-income-etf-and-a-hidden-paradox\"> private credit</a> segment (although more directed towards the apparent calm in the CLO market, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834161-bizd-the-great-income-etf-and-a-hidden-paradox\">read here</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But net of this, at least in theory, if a credit shock arrives, not systemic in nature like the 2008 crisis, FLXR could have smaller drawdowns compared to funds more loaded with traditional IG/HY corporate precisely because it uses this event opportunistically, as happened in April 2025 (even if it was not a real shock).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I was pleasantly involved by the analysis of FLXR. From the study of TCW’s view, through the opportunistic strategy, up to the analysis of the holding distribution, this ETF has carried me into a positive narrative. Of course, active management does not mean certainty of returns, and in shock contexts the credit market suffers a bit in all segments, and if you follow me, you will surely know what my recent concerns are regarding the private credit segment. But as of today, compared to the peers, it has at least demonstrated greater resilience. For this reason, net of the risks of the sector, I think that for FLXR the BUY rating is justified.</p>",

Still, I argued that in the long term, I see Visa delivering better results due to several key differences.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far, things have developed as I thought, but it hasn't been too meaningful to affect results. However, I think that from now on, the case for Visa over Mastercard will become stronger, and the recent quarter is a good example.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Differences Between Mastercard And Visa Are Set To Take Center Stage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's be honest, Mastercard and Visa are nearly identical businesses. Every time one of them comes up with a novel offering, the other immediately finds a way to offer the same thing. Recently, we saw this with <a href=\"https://corporate.visa.com/en/products/intelligent-commerce.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://corporate.visa.com/en/products/intelligent-commerce.html\" target=\"_blank\">agentic commerce</a> and <a href=\"https://www.mastercard.com/mt/en/news-and-trends/stories/2025/mastercard-stablecoin-utility-and-scale.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.mastercard.com/mt/en/news-and-trends/stories/2025/mastercard-stablecoin-utility-and-scale.html\" target=\"_blank\">stablecoins</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, where do they actually differ?

Meanwhile, Visa <a href=\"https://s1.q4cdn.com/050606653/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Visa-Inc-Fourth-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://s1.q4cdn.com/050606653/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Visa-Inc-Fourth-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results-Presentation.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">guided</a> for the high end of low-double-digit growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we take their outlooks and translate them into numbers, I think we can assume Mastercard is expecting 17% revenue growth, or 12% organically, while Visa is expecting 13%-14% organic growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, the bottom line is Mastercard continues to deliver extraordinary numbers, but they are no longer more extraordinary than Visa's. In fact, in many areas, they are less extraordinary.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation &amp; Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To me, what we saw in Q3 is going to continue. Currently, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MA/earnings/estimates\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MA/earnings/estimates\" target=\"_blank\">consensus</a> sees Mastercard growing revenues by 12% in 2026, while Visa is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/V/earnings/estimates?period=annual\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/V/earnings/estimates?period=annual\" target=\"_blank\">expected</a> to grow 11%. This would be the narrowest gap in a long time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, considering their CY26 multiples, Mastercard's premium of 15% is about in line with the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MA/valuation/metrics\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MA/valuation/metrics\" target=\"_blank\">historical average</a>, but it's not supported by the same growth gap, as we discussed.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_0e96eaf5a89f48e53ddfb05475db0eb3.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On its own, Mastercard trades at the high end of its historical valuation range, ahead of what's going to be a lower growth period (though still strong at low double digits).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my mind, considering all of the above, Mastercard trades at a fair valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mastercard remains one of the best companies I know of, and I believe that investors who hold it for the long term will benefit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, I think that in Q3, we saw the growth lead over Visa at its lowest level, and I estimate the closing of the gap will continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This time, it will take center stage and be much more obvious for investors, as it will come down to actual results rather than future estimates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, I can't recommend buying Mastercard here, at a sizeable premium, when Visa is a better prospect in my view. Therefore, I downgrade Mastercard to \"Hold.\"</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One important clarification: I wouldn't sell Mastercard shares and replace them with Visa if there are meaningful capital gains involved. I do think Visa is meaningfully more attractive, but not to this extent.</p>",

This step raised the pro-forma net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio to approximately 3.7×, which worried the market. However, a substantial portion (approx. 5%) of the transaction was paid in CBIZ shares, subject to Marcum's management's commitment to work with the new entity for 4 years. This means the partners who built Marcum and its relationships now hold a meaningful equity interest in CBIZ, and their long-term incentives are tied to the merger's success, reducing the departure of talent and clients after the acquisition, which is a crucial detail often overlooked by the market, and significantly reduces the risks of the merger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2866\" data-height=\"200\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Form 8-K - Exhibit 99.1\" width=\"640\" height=\"45\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-17613323683694143_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Form 8-K - Exhibit 99.1</p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2798\" data-height=\"120\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Form 8-K - Exhibit 99.1\" width=\"640\" height=\"27\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/24/59349569-1761332459828681_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Form 8-K - Exhibit 99.1</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong Market</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CBIZ is built for the middle market, focusing on medium-sized companies. Marcum deal doubles CBIZ's dominance in this stable and profitable market, which is the backbone of growth and employment in the U.S. economy. This segment tends to be more resilient in economic fluctuations. Besides, these types of companies are mostly too big for local small accounting firms, yet too small for large firms such as the Big Four.

CBIZ revenues from the insurance and benefits sector were stable, mitigating the intensity of seasonality. Following the acquisition deal, which doubles the size of the financial services sector, the combined profits are expected to be more seasonal, with a higher concentration in the first half of the year. Therefore, any investor who does not consider this point might worry about the results of the second half quarters, although this is merely a natural rhythm depending on the company's nature.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to the company's <a href=\"https://ir.cbiz.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cbiz-reports-third-quarter-and-nine-month-2025-results\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.cbiz.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cbiz-reports-third-quarter-and-nine-month-2025-results\" target=\"_blank\">guidance</a>, it expects adjusted EBITDA of $450 million for 2025.

Considering the recent strong performance, low valuation compared to peers, and the company's repurchase of approximately 800,000 shares, which confirms the cheap stock price, it would be fair to give a \"Buy\" rating. However, investors should monitor debt repayment progress each quarter, as this is an essential event that will significantly reduce risks and lead to higher multiples.</p>",

Mostly not. IUS has a place in the cohort of ETFs I am constructive on, but nothing more. This is a Hold rating at best. Sure, as I have already said in the previous article, IUS is a good candidate for a quality investor's ETF shortlist, but it would clearly be an exaggeration to say that it has the potential to outperform the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVV\" title=\"iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF\">IVV</a>) or the iShares Russell 1000 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWB\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 ETF\">IWB</a>) in the current market conditions.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Basics of The Invesco RAFI™ Strategic US ETF</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Inception: September 12, 2018</li> <li>Investment Adviser: Invesco Capital Management LLC</li> <li>AUM: $689.01 million, as of October 30</li> <li>Expense Ratio: 0.19%</li> <li>5-Year Annualized Total Return (October 2020–September 2025): 17.45% vs. IVV's 16.45%</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">IUS Strategy Recap</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As explained on the Invesco <a href=\"https://www.invesco.com/us/en/financial-products/etfs/invesco-rafi-strategic-us-etf.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>, the Invesco Strategic US Index, which \"...is designed to measure the performance of high quality, large-sized US companies,\" is the very core of IUS' passive strategy. The index is reconstituted just once a year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It has a selection and weighting process that I usually call sophisticated or labyrinthine—smart beta at its best. That is to say, the index provider goes very much beyond just picking the most expensive names in the market and assigning them weights depending on their market caps (this is almost what the S&amp;P 500 does, but of course with a lot of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794160-ivv-us-bellwethers-in-an-ultra-low-cost-etf-wrapper\">nuances</a>). Instead, it relies on the \"business-size score,\" which is the main instrument in deciding whether a company has quality high enough to qualify for the index. As described by IUS:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The securities are assigned a business-size score based on the equally-weighted average of sales, operating cash flow, total return of capital and book value over the prior five years or life of the security. For real estate securities, operating cash flow is replaced by funds from operations and book value is replaced by total assets. The securities are then assigned a quality score based on the equally-weighted average of efficiency (ratio of sales-to-assets in the prior year) and growth (percentage change in ratio of sales-to-assets over the prior five years or life of the security). Finally, each eligible security is ranked in descending order by its Business-Size score. For inclusion in the index, securities ranked in the top 90% by Business-Size score are eligible and, of those 80% with the highest Quality score. Securities in the Index are weighted based on their float-adjusted Business-Size scores.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">IUS Performance: Good At Mitigating Losses, But Bad At Capturing Upside</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Incepted in September 2018, IUS has had a quite mixed performance, with grossly successful years followed by rather soft ones. So beating IVV and IWB (I have added the latter ETF as the Russell 1000 Index is IUS' benchmark as per the factsheet, and IVV is a market proxy that I use in my ETF research) was not something its business-size score-centered strategy was potent enough to accomplish.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0804befffd08053045fe0b1c6e1fa43d.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0804befffd08053045fe0b1c6e1fa43d.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0804befffd08053045fe0b1c6e1fa43d.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0804befffd08053045fe0b1c6e1fa43d.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0804befffd08053045fe0b1c6e1fa43d.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0804befffd08053045fe0b1c6e1fa43d.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0804befffd08053045fe0b1c6e1fa43d.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0804befffd08053045fe0b1c6e1fa43d.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_0804befffd08053045fe0b1c6e1fa43d.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, it still should be noted that it has outperformed such quality factor-focused peers as the Fidelity Quality Factor ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FQAL\" title=\"Fidelity Quality Factor ETF\">FQAL</a>), the iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QUAL\" title=\"iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF\">QUAL</a>), and the JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JQUA\" title=\"JPMorgan U.S. Quality Factor ETF\">JQUA</a>), though the Invesco S&amp;P 500® Quality ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPHQ\" title=\"Invesco S&amp;P 500® Quality ETF\">SPHQ</a>) was racier.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Annual Performance</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Delving deeper, we see that IUS outperformed IWB and IVV only in October–December 2018, 2021, and 2022.

the 2022 loss was just 8.35%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, its maximum drawdown over the period was 22.65% (the one it delivered in March 2020), which of course does not look comfortable at all, but almost all ETFs in the group (JQUA is an exception) still delivered much deeper drawdowns (for most, the deepest drawdowns were in 2022, not 2020).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, while this clearly speaks in its favor, I do not think this is enough for a Buy thesis as there are other facts to consider.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Its annualized return over the period was weaker than those of IVV, IWB, and SPHQ.</li> <li>It was more volatile than SPHQ, JQUA, and FQAL, as illustrated by the standard deviation.</li> <li>Its upside capture ratio was just 94.53% (compared to, for instance, 100.85% of QUAL), which means it is quite weak at benefitting from tech-, growth factor-, and AI enthusiasm-driven bull markets like the one the S&amp;P 500 is currently in.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">IUS Portfolio Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of October 29, there were 544 common stocks, REITs, and ADRs in the IUS portfolio, key among them being Alphabet Inc.

Importantly, there are only Class A shares in this portfolio, and Class C shares (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) are absent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A massive 91.6% of IUS' net assets is allocated to S&amp;P 500 constituents. However, as a result of the ETF's focus on the business-size score, most of these names are value or value-ish stocks, as I will explain shortly.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td>Parameter</td> <td><strong>IUS</strong></td> <td>IVV</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Stocks present in both IUS and IVV portfolios</td> <td><strong>91.76%</strong></td> <td>94.71%</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Calculated by the author using data from the ETFs</em></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Ten Holdings</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the cohort of the key ten holdings, we see that IUS has significantly underweighted the locomotives of the bull market like NVIDIA Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) and Microsoft Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), while significantly boosting exposure to the old-economy names like Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Financial data as of October 30</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me summarize a few essential takeaways.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>IUS is a solid choice for value investors who would not compromise on quality. Indeed, a combination of a weighted average adjusted earnings yield of 4.54% and a nearly 95% allocation to companies with a B- Quant Profitability rating or higher makes an impression.</li> <li>Low volatility-focused investors should appreciate the weighted average 24-month beta of its portfolio of 0.9.</li> <li>However, for growth and momentum investors (and the S&amp;P 500 is in the bull market driven by these exact factors), IUS has little to offer (a close to 2x difference in the weighted average forward growth rates of IUS and IVV is telling).</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, the Invesco RAFI™ Strategic US ETF is certainly a decent investment vehicle with healthy returns secured by its carefully calibrated strategy. Alas, 'healthy returns' and consistent outperformance are not the same. Sure, IUS has proved that it can deliver more comfortable maximum drawdowns than most of its peers, but beating IVV systematically is certainly not what it can do. So, while appreciating its quality characteristics, I maintain the Hold rating.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIVB\" title=\"Civista Bancshares, Inc.\">CIVB</a></span>) in April 2025, the stock price has declined by around 4%. Also, since then, the company has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20162913-civista-bancshares-inc-announces-agreement-to-acquire-the-farmers-savings-bank-launches\">announced</a> a new public offering of its shares<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and the acquisition of Farmers Savings Bank. These two transactions are not big, but they will have a material dilution effect on per-share items. To update my earnings estimates and investment thesis, I’m going to start by looking at the company’s balance sheet and earnings potential.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Acquisition, Pipelines to Counter Risks from Tariffs</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Loan growth over the last two quarters has been even worse than I’d imagined in my last report on the company, which I wrote in April. The net loan balance at the end of September was 0.3% lower than the balance at the end of March 2025. The management blamed “a bunch of expected payoffs” for the performance in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4832689-civista-bancshares-inc-civb-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">conference call</a>. Further, the management said that it wasn't aggressive in trying to bring new business into the bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is hope for a recovery, partly because the loan pipelines are strong. The management mentioned in the conference call that the current pipeline is higher than it was last year, and significantly higher than it was earlier in the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, Civista Bancshares is on track to close the acquisition of Farmers Savings Bank in November. Farmers operated in Northeast Ohio and had around $104 million in net loans at the time when the transaction was announced, as per a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20162913-civista-bancshares-inc-announces-agreement-to-acquire-the-farmers-savings-bank-launches\">press release</a>. This acquisition can boost the loan balance by around 3.4% in the last quarter of 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A threat to loan growth is the US trade policy. Civista Bancshares mostly operates in Ohio, whose economy is affected to a significant degree by US-Canada relations. According to the <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/map/state-benefits/oh\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. Trade Representative</a>, around 35% of Ohio’s exports went to Canada in 2024. To put this in perspective, only around 15.8% of the US’s exports go to Canada, according to the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/topyr.html\" rel=\"noopener\">Census Bureau</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, the US-Canada relations have taken a turn for the worse in recent weeks. The US President has announced a 10% increase in tariffs on Canadian goods after recent advertisements by Ontario’s Premier showing President Reagan arguing against tariffs, according to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ljgrm78zo\" rel=\"noopener\">news reports</a>. However, the Senate has voted to repeal the tariffs on Canada, according to the latest <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5577345-live-updates-trump-south-korea-government-shutdown/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">news reports</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The management mentioned in the conference call that it is targeting mid-single-digit loan growth going forward. Considering the acquisition, the pipelines, and the risks related to tariffs, I’m expecting the loan book to grow by 4.0% in 4Q’25, which will take the full-year loan growth to 4.5%. Further, for 2026, I’m expecting loan growth of 4.1%. In addition, I’m assuming deposits will grow in line with loans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Balance Sheet Forecast\" width=\"529\" height=\"205\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"529\" data-height=\"205\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Data from SEC Filings, Analyst's Estimates</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Acquisition, Rate Cuts to Lift the Margin</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the net interest margin grew by an impressive 28 basis points in the first half of this year, it fell by 6 basis points in the third quarter of the year. This fall wasn’t unexpected, and I’m not worried about it. There is a chance of net interest margin growth in the next couple of quarters, albeit by only a small amount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The management mentioned in the conference call that the margin could expand by 5 basis points in 4Q’25 due to Fed funds rate cuts and the acquisition of Farmers Savings Bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond 4Q’25, I’m expecting further margin expansion because I’m expecting 50 basis points of Fed funds rate cuts in 2026. Civista Bancshares’ deposit cost is quite rate-sensitive, as interest-bearing demand, savings, and money market deposits made up around 48% of total deposits. These deposits can be repriced soon after rate cuts. Hence, the deposit cost will fall as market interest rates decline, leading to margin expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I’m expecting the net interest margin to rise by 5 basis points in 4Q’25 and then by 6 basis points in 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expecting the Efficiency Ratio to Worsen</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apart from giving small boosts to the loan balance and net interest margin, the acquisition will also benefit earnings through cost savings. The management mentioned in the conference call that it expected to make cost savings through the system conversion, which will reduce contract expenses. Further, the management is planning staff reduction following the merger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Civista Bancshares has shown remarkable expense discipline so far this year. The efficiency ratio improved to 64.1% in 3Q’25 from 71.9% in 3Q’24. Tariffs and their impact on inflation can raise the efficiency ratio in the future. However, the Fed Chair did note that, “I think it would not be appropriate to just ignore or assume away the inflation issue; at the same time, I think the risk of higher, more persistent inflation has declined significantly since April,” according to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-in-fog-it-heads-toward-another-rate-cut-2025-10-29/\" rel=\"noopener\">news reports</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering the benefits from the acquisition and tariff threats, I’m expecting the efficiency ratio to rise to 66% in 2026 from 64.1% in 3Q’25.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expecting EPS of $2.6 for 2025 and $2.5 for 2026</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the time I last wrote about Civista Bancshares in April, the company had yet to announce its plans for an acquisition and a new public offering of shares. Under the public offering, Civista Bancshares’ shares outstanding increased by 3,788,238 shares, or 25%, according to details given in the earnings release. As a result, my previous report and the earnings estimate I gave in it are outdated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m now expecting the earnings per share to dip from the level seen in the first nine months of 2025, mostly because of the dilution effect of the new share issuance. The net income (not per share) will likely be higher because of low loan growth and slight margin expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m also assuming the non-interest income will remain rangebound after a small acquisition-related jump in 4Q’25. Further, I’m assuming the provision expense to loan ratio will remain near a normal level of 0.03% after spiking in 4Q’25 due to the acquisition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I’m expecting Civista Bancshares to report an EPS of $0.56 per share in 4Q’25, which will take full-year earnings to $2.60.

Civista Bancshares also offers a dividend yield of 3.1% at a quarterly dividend rate of $0.17 per share. Adding the price upside to the dividend yield gives a total expected return of 14.7%. Hence, I’m upgrading Civista Bancshares to a buy rating from my previous rating of hold.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s earnings per share are set to decline, and my valuation analysis shows that the market has overreacted to the EPS outlook. It seems the market has discounted Civista Bancshares too much in light of the expected EPS decline. I believe Civista Bancshares should trade higher, and a buy rating is appropriate for the stock.</p>",

The BDC last declared a quarterly cash dividend of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4478091-great-elm-capital-declares-0_37-dividend\">$0.37 per share</a>, kept unchanged from its prior distribution, and $1.48 per share annualized for a 19.6% dividend yield. This yield has moved up to its highest ever level on the back of common shares that have lost around 31% of their value since the start of the year. Bulls would be right to highlight that the common shares have dipped by around 33% since the news of the FBG bankruptcy, a rate that's more than 3x greater than the expected dip to net asset value (\"NAV\") that's expected from a total loss of the debt investment in FBG. The BDC's allocation to first lien debt is smaller than the broader BDC space at 47% as of the end of the second quarter, with CLOs the second largest allocation at 17% and a growing business for GECC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1808\" data-height=\"1008\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Great Elm Capital Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Portfolio Asset Mix\" width=\"640\" height=\"357\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Great Elm Capital Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Presentation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net Asset Value Discount, NII, And Dividend Coverage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Great Elm Capital Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Income Statement\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"145\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Great Elm Capital Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Form 10-Q</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">GECC reported a second-quarter total investment income of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4477993-great-elm-capital-reports-q2-results\">$14.3 million</a>, a new quarterly record and up substantially by 50% from $9.5 million in its year-ago comp.

The gains were driven by NII and unrealized gains on its investment portfolio. Critically, while the surge in NII meant the company covered its base cash dividend by 138%, shareholders will need to dampen NII expectations for the whole year. GECC described the dividend income as being driven by a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4808748-great-elm-capital-corporation-gecc-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">once-a-year dividend payment</a> on preferred shares of an insurance-related investment.

This type of dilution, when its common shares are swapping hands at such a steep discount to NAV, heightens the dip of the common shares. The BDC's shares outstanding is up at least 52% over the last 3 years, a pace of dilution that's annualized at 17%. This would form a core reason to not buy the stock, with the ticker being rated as a hold.</p>",
