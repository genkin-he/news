(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIVB\" title=\"Civista Bancshares, Inc.\">CIVB</a></span>) in April 2025, the stock price has declined by around 4%. Also, since then, the company has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20162913-civista-bancshares-inc-announces-agreement-to-acquire-the-farmers-savings-bank-launches\">announced</a> a new public offering of its shares<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and the acquisition of Farmers Savings Bank. These two transactions are not big, but they will have a material dilution effect on per-share items. To update my earnings estimates and investment thesis, I’m going to start by looking at the company’s balance sheet and earnings potential.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Acquisition, Pipelines to Counter Risks from Tariffs</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Loan growth over the last two quarters has been even worse than I’d imagined in my last report on the company, which I wrote in April. The net loan balance at the end of September was 0.3% lower than the balance at the end of March 2025. The management blamed “a bunch of expected payoffs” for the performance in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4832689-civista-bancshares-inc-civb-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">conference call</a>. Further, the management said that it wasn't aggressive in trying to bring new business into the bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is hope for a recovery, partly because the loan pipelines are strong. The management mentioned in the conference call that the current pipeline is higher than it was last year, and significantly higher than it was earlier in the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, Civista Bancshares is on track to close the acquisition of Farmers Savings Bank in November. Farmers operated in Northeast Ohio and had around $104 million in net loans at the time when the transaction was announced, as per a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20162913-civista-bancshares-inc-announces-agreement-to-acquire-the-farmers-savings-bank-launches\">press release</a>. This acquisition can boost the loan balance by around 3.4% in the last quarter of 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A threat to loan growth is the US trade policy. Civista Bancshares mostly operates in Ohio, whose economy is affected to a significant degree by US-Canada relations. According to the <a href=\"https://ustr.gov/map/state-benefits/oh\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. Trade Representative</a>, around 35% of Ohio’s exports went to Canada in 2024. To put this in perspective, only around 15.8% of the US’s exports go to Canada, according to the <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/statistics/highlights/topyr.html\" rel=\"noopener\">Census Bureau</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, the US-Canada relations have taken a turn for the worse in recent weeks. The US President has announced a 10% increase in tariffs on Canadian goods after recent advertisements by Ontario’s Premier showing President Reagan arguing against tariffs, according to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ljgrm78zo\" rel=\"noopener\">news reports</a>. However, the Senate has voted to repeal the tariffs on Canada, according to the latest <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5577345-live-updates-trump-south-korea-government-shutdown/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">news reports</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The management mentioned in the conference call that it is targeting mid-single-digit loan growth going forward. Considering the acquisition, the pipelines, and the risks related to tariffs, I’m expecting the loan book to grow by 4.0% in 4Q’25, which will take the full-year loan growth to 4.5%. Further, for 2026, I’m expecting loan growth of 4.1%. In addition, I’m assuming deposits will grow in line with loans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Balance Sheet Forecast\" width=\"529\" height=\"205\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"529\" data-height=\"205\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848044380937.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Data from SEC Filings, Analyst's Estimates</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Acquisition, Rate Cuts to Lift the Margin</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the net interest margin grew by an impressive 28 basis points in the first half of this year, it fell by 6 basis points in the third quarter of the year. This fall wasn’t unexpected, and I’m not worried about it. There is a chance of net interest margin growth in the next couple of quarters, albeit by only a small amount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The management mentioned in the conference call that the margin could expand by 5 basis points in 4Q’25 due to Fed funds rate cuts and the acquisition of Farmers Savings Bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond 4Q’25, I’m expecting further margin expansion because I’m expecting 50 basis points of Fed funds rate cuts in 2026. Civista Bancshares’ deposit cost is quite rate-sensitive, as interest-bearing demand, savings, and money market deposits made up around 48% of total deposits. These deposits can be repriced soon after rate cuts. Hence, the deposit cost will fall as market interest rates decline, leading to margin expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I’m expecting the net interest margin to rise by 5 basis points in 4Q’25 and then by 6 basis points in 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expecting the Efficiency Ratio to Worsen</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apart from giving small boosts to the loan balance and net interest margin, the acquisition will also benefit earnings through cost savings. The management mentioned in the conference call that it expected to make cost savings through the system conversion, which will reduce contract expenses. Further, the management is planning staff reduction following the merger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Civista Bancshares has shown remarkable expense discipline so far this year. The efficiency ratio improved to 64.1% in 3Q’25 from 71.9% in 3Q’24. Tariffs and their impact on inflation can raise the efficiency ratio in the future. However, the Fed Chair did note that, “I think it would not be appropriate to just ignore or assume away the inflation issue; at the same time, I think the risk of higher, more persistent inflation has declined significantly since April,” according to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-in-fog-it-heads-toward-another-rate-cut-2025-10-29/\" rel=\"noopener\">news reports</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering the benefits from the acquisition and tariff threats, I’m expecting the efficiency ratio to rise to 66% in 2026 from 64.1% in 3Q’25.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expecting EPS of $2.6 for 2025 and $2.5 for 2026</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the time I last wrote about Civista Bancshares in April, the company had yet to announce its plans for an acquisition and a new public offering of shares. Under the public offering, Civista Bancshares’ shares outstanding increased by 3,788,238 shares, or 25%, according to details given in the earnings release. As a result, my previous report and the earnings estimate I gave in it are outdated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m now expecting the earnings per share to dip from the level seen in the first nine months of 2025, mostly because of the dilution effect of the new share issuance. The net income (not per share) will likely be higher because of low loan growth and slight margin expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m also assuming the non-interest income will remain rangebound after a small acquisition-related jump in 4Q’25. Further, I’m assuming the provision expense to loan ratio will remain near a normal level of 0.03% after spiking in 4Q’25 due to the acquisition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I’m expecting Civista Bancshares to report an EPS of $0.56 per share in 4Q’25, which will take full-year earnings to $2.60. For 2026, I’m expecting an EPS of $2.50.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The street consensus estimate is similar to my estimates and can be viewed <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIVB/earnings/estimates\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-17618480248076878.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Income Statement Forecast\" width=\"529\" height=\"167\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"529\" data-height=\"167\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-17618480248076878.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-17618480248076878.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-17618480248076878.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-17618480248076878.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-17618480248076878.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-17618480248076878.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-17618480248076878.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-17618480248076878.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Data from SEC Filings, Analyst's Estimates</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Upgrading to Buy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I adopted a hold rating on Civista Bancshares in April. Since then, the stock price has dropped by around 4%. As the company has issued new shares and announced an upcoming acquisition since my last report, my previous investment thesis is outdated. To update my valuation, I’m using the historical average price-to-earnings (“P/E”) and price-to-tangible book (“P/TB”) multiples given below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_d45bc3b0b0597b7eb7bff6f05794b787.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_d45bc3b0b0597b7eb7bff6f05794b787.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_d45bc3b0b0597b7eb7bff6f05794b787.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_d45bc3b0b0597b7eb7bff6f05794b787.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_d45bc3b0b0597b7eb7bff6f05794b787.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_d45bc3b0b0597b7eb7bff6f05794b787.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_d45bc3b0b0597b7eb7bff6f05794b787.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_d45bc3b0b0597b7eb7bff6f05794b787.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_d45bc3b0b0597b7eb7bff6f05794b787.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Multiplying the average P/E multiple by my EPS forecast gives a target price of $20.9 for the end of 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848005697608.png?io=w640\" alt=\"price to Earnings Value Sensitivity\" width=\"411\" height=\"127\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"411\" data-height=\"127\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848005697608.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848005697608.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848005697608.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848005697608.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848005697608.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848005697608.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848005697608.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-1761848005697608.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Analyst's Estimates</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Multiplying the average P/TB multiple by my TBVPS forecast gives a target price of $27.4 for the end of 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-17618479892567022.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Price to Tangible Book Sensitivity\" width=\"437\" height=\"127\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"437\" data-height=\"127\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-17618479892567022.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-17618479892567022.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-17618479892567022.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-17618479892567022.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-17618479892567022.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-17618479892567022.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-17618479892567022.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50154578-17618479892567022.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Analyst's Estimates</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The average price target comes out to $24.1, which suggests an 11.5% price upside from the October 29 closing market price. Civista Bancshares also offers a dividend yield of 3.1% at a quarterly dividend rate of $0.17 per share. Adding the price upside to the dividend yield gives a total expected return of 14.7%. Hence, I’m upgrading Civista Bancshares to a buy rating from my previous rating of hold.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s earnings per share are set to decline, and my valuation analysis shows that the market has overreacted to the EPS outlook. It seems the market has discounted Civista Bancshares too much in light of the expected EPS decline. I believe Civista Bancshares should trade higher, and a buy rating is appropriate for the stock.</p>",

The BDC last declared a quarterly cash dividend of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4478091-great-elm-capital-declares-0_37-dividend\">$0.37 per share</a>, kept unchanged from its prior distribution, and $1.48 per share annualized for a 19.6% dividend yield. This yield has moved up to its highest ever level on the back of common shares that have lost around 31% of their value since the start of the year. Bulls would be right to highlight that the common shares have dipped by around 33% since the news of the FBG bankruptcy, a rate that's more than 3x greater than the expected dip to net asset value (\"NAV\") that's expected from a total loss of the debt investment in FBG. The BDC's allocation to first lien debt is smaller than the broader BDC space at 47% as of the end of the second quarter, with CLOs the second largest allocation at 17% and a growing business for GECC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1808\" data-height=\"1008\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Great Elm Capital Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Portfolio Asset Mix\" width=\"640\" height=\"357\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-17600261585949848_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Great Elm Capital Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Presentation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net Asset Value Discount, NII, And Dividend Coverage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Great Elm Capital Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Income Statement\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"145\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/9/41871776-1760022730220506.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Great Elm Capital Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Form 10-Q</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">GECC reported a second-quarter total investment income of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4477993-great-elm-capital-reports-q2-results\">$14.3 million</a>, a new quarterly record and up substantially by 50% from $9.5 million in its year-ago comp.

The gains were driven by NII and unrealized gains on its investment portfolio. Critically, while the surge in NII meant the company covered its base cash dividend by 138%, shareholders will need to dampen NII expectations for the whole year. GECC described the dividend income as being driven by a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4808748-great-elm-capital-corporation-gecc-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">once-a-year dividend payment</a> on preferred shares of an insurance-related investment.

This was followed up with its at-the-market program, allowed the BDC to sell an additional 1.1 million shares for $13 million. This type of dilution, when its common shares are swapping hands at such a steep discount to NAV, heightens the dip of the common shares. The BDC's shares outstanding is up at least 52% over the last 3 years, a pace of dilution that's annualized at 17%. This would form a core reason to not buy the stock, with the ticker being rated as a hold.</p>",

After their IPO, the music fan in me couldn't be more excited to have a stake in the works of amazing <a href=\"https://www.universalmusic.com/for-umg-artists/\" rel=\"nofollow\">artists</a> like The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, Drake, and so many more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond my love of music, I thought UMG was going to be a great investment. It has an extremely wide moat in the form of its unparalleled catalog and relationships with artists.

Also, I don't think we can say that UMG is attractively valued when it trades at such a significant premium, even though it is growing faster and much larger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To me, as long as the EV / EBITDA / Growth multiple remains far above 1.5x, currently at 1.9x, the valuation is too high relative to the business prospects.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Universal Music Group closed off another quarter without meaningful acceleration. This is alarming, as the stock has been dead money for nearly five years. By definition, investors need to see a change in the fundamental story before they can expect better stock performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the new Spotify deal, it seems there is no structural change in the growth rate. With unpredictable margins and a relatively high valuation, I don't see a path to market-beating returns. That said, I don't think the downside is too extreme either.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, I reiterate a 'Hold' for UMG, and while I'm not short the stock, I encourage investors to allocate their money elsewhere due to opportunity costs.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

As expected, given the high average gold price and gold/oil ratio during the quarter, the results were extremely good and included record-high quarterly cash flow.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company earned US$1.71/share during the quarter, which is US$6.84/share annualised. This means that despite this year’s large gain in its share price, NEM is being valued by the stock market at only about 12 times trailing earnings. We expect that it will be a similar story for most senior and mid-tier gold producers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further to comments in our lithium discussion earlier in today’s report, the fact that earnings are high and P/E ratios are low in the gold mining sector does not preclude the possibility that a long-term price top is forming.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the contrary, in the commodity realm, financial results and valuations tend to be most inviting near the ends of bull markets. However, the signs that normally are seen near the end of a gold-mining bull market are not currently evident. Before we get to that, the long-term underperformance of gold mining stocks relative to gold bullion is worth a brief revisit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main reason that gold mining stocks, as a group, underperform gold bullion over the long term is that just as monetary inflation and the associated interest rate manipulation promote malinvestment in the broad economy, they do the same in the gold mining sector. The difference is that booms in the gold mining sector generally coincide with busts in the broad economy, and vice versa.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As an aside, don’t be misled by the performances of equity indices such as the SPX into thinking that the US economy is in the boom phase of the economic cycle. Due to the domination of passive investing, the performance of the stock market now has very little to do with the performance of the broad economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the US economy over the past few years, there have been booms in a small number of sectors, chief among them being AI and the related infrastructure, but the economy as a whole has been in the bust phase. Busts usually, but not always, culminate in a recession, with a surge in monetary inflation associated with the official response to the recession sowing the seeds of the next boom.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the gold mining sector, the malinvestment that eventually stems from a boom involves ill-conceived acquisitions and project developments, the costs of which get written off years later during the bust phase. The result is wealth destruction over the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A point we want to make today is that at this stage of the gold sector’s boom, there are no signs of widespread malinvestment. On the contrary, NEM and other large-scale gold producers still appear to be more focussed on cost reduction and cash-flow maximisation than on growth, especially ‘growth at any price’. This suggests to us that the end of the boom phase is not imminent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The end of the boom is not imminent, but the intermediate-term upward trend that began late last year is almost certainly over.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

By that measure, they already embody financial scarcity value separate from physical resource scarcity. A sampling of some in the Permian Basin, as well as others, will give a sense of the diversity of opportunities to pre-position portfolios in non-correlated, localized inflation beneficiaries. It's a group that constructively lends itself to fund-based participation, since in conventional market terms it is a motley, trading-illiquid crew with virtually no analytical coverage or index inclusion. Which is why we've endeavored to create a number of funds around these resource, inflation hedge, and return vectors.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>WaterBridge Infrastructure</strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>WaterBridge Infrastructure (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBI\" title=\"WaterBridge Infrastructure LLC\">WBI</a>)</strong>, with a stock market value of $3.0 billion, —although only about $1 billion is traded—is the largest water-handling company in the U.S. This all but requires a dominant position in the Delaware Basin, the nation's most important and profitable oil-and-gas basin. A demonstration of the economic significance of this business, as de minimis as it might seem, is that if water takeaway activity is curtailed or stopped, then drilling must be curtailed or stopped, since about four barrels of water come up from the well with every oil-equivalent barrel. There must be a place to put it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A virtually identical company operating in the same area, <strong>Aris Water Solutions (ARIS)</strong>, was acquired two weeks ago by a natural gas pipeline company for $1.5 billion. WaterBridge's 2,500 miles of pipeline have produced water handling volumes of about 2.4 million barrels/day; Aris's water handling volume was 1.2 million barrels/day. These volumes will continue to expand, even if oil-and-gas volumes weren't to, because as wells either age or go deeper, the proportion of water produced rises. Of course, pricing can rise, too.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If only a single inference-rich metric of this business were to be offered, a good one would be this: the revenue and operating margin in this business, per barrel of water, are about $0.85 and $0.45. This translates into a 51% operating margin—for a business that has yet to reach operating scale efficiencies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thinking about the extravagant scale of AI datacenter demand, and about the necessary localized electric power demand, and the necessary localized natural gas demand, and in turn about the required localized water demand... and then thinking about somehow getting exposure to this limiting factor at the end of that trillion-dollar chain of demand:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>If WaterBridge were somehow included in the S&amp;P 500, its index weight, if proportional to News Corp.'s $15 billion market cap and sub-one-basis point weight at the very bottom of the S&amp;P 500, then WaterBridge would have a weight of less than , or of one percent.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Tejon Ranch</strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Tejon Ranch </strong>is the largest contiguous private property, at 270,000 acres, in California. Located 60 miles north of Los Angeles, its largely undeveloped land includes 16 miles of frontage on either side of I-5, California's primary north-south roadway. The I-5 is the busiest in the nation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among other operating assets, the property includes 7 million sq. ft. of fully leased logistics terminals economically proximate to the Port of Los Angeles, and which is readily expandable. This year, residents moved into the first of three Tejon Ranch master-planned communities to be entitled. The company's strategy is to invest in getting land entitled for commercial and residential development, enhancing the land value with each step in that process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Land is <em>not </em>real estate, though it can become real estate. It certainly isn't a REIT, which is a debt-leveraged, financialized investment that can't compound adequately versus inflation, since it must issue more debt and/or equity in order to fund property acquisitions. If Tejon Ranch is a strategic type of asset, the price for it, in market cap, is $430 million.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>LandBridge Company</strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>LandBridge Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LB\" title=\"LandBridge Company LLC\">LB</a>) </strong>controls a portfolio of 277,000 acres in the “core” of drilling activity in the Permian (Delaware) Basin. It was created in October of 2021 to procure land that is requisite for managing water infrastructure in that unique locale. Water infrastructure, unlike oil and gas, is not subject to eminent domain protections, despite water egress and disposal being an essential aspect of hydrocarbon extraction. This is to say, Texas landowners must provide easements (at reasonable rates) to oil and gas infrastructure providers to facilitate energy extraction; no such protection is granted to water infrastructure. The result is surface land being a highly strategic but still underappreciated asset in the energy industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company operates similar to a “triple-net” lessor. It incurs minimal expenses (operating and capital) related to the development of the land; it is the lessee—oh, say Chevron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX\" title=\"Chevron Corporation\">CVX</a>)’s field operations team and potentially Microsoft’s contracted datacenter builder/manager—that bears that burden. In this way, consonant with a royalty business, higher water volumes, market capture and pricing all flow through to the shareholders in a capital efficient manner. The land position also facilitates exceptional returns on invested capital investment opportunities for water infrastructure developers, adding another growth vector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It should be noted that this land is also proximate to various high-profile data center campus developments and is thus well-positioned to benefit from this development—at no incremental cost to the company. Optionality is so prized in the financial markets, and so many sophisticated and often probabilistically improbable strategies are pursued in its name—options, futures, leverage, <em>any </em>kind of technology, growth stock investing, IPO investing, venture capital—that it one almost hears resonant echoes of that old 1980 favorite by Johnny Lee [unfairly butchered to suit <em>this </em>venue]:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <h3>Lookin' For Optionality</h3> <p>Well, I spent a lifetime lookin' for you</p> <p>... Playin' a fool's game, hopin' to win</p> <p>And tellin' those sweet lies and losin' again</p> <p>I was lookin' for optionality in all the wrong placesLookin' in too many facesSearchin' their eyes and lookin' for traces (oooh-oooh)Of what I'm dreamin' of...</p> </blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>San Juan Basin Royalty Trust</strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>San Juan Basin Royalty Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SJT\" title=\"San Juan Basin Royalty Trust\">SJT</a>) </strong>is a natural gas royalty trust with 119,000 net acres in northwest New Mexico. It is relatively unusual as being a pureplay on natural gas, of which there are few. This one, at this time, also presents another predictive attribute, a transitory “problem” that provides an equity yield curve opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike a pure royalty, this trust is a “net profit interest” that receives payment net of the operator (Hilcorp) operating and capital costs. The trust is not obligated to provide capital for these costs, but they are deducted from distributions, and in the event of a deficit, accumulated until covered by net cash flows. In practice, there is an interest-free capital contribution arrangement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hilcorp increased the capital investment budget to $34 million in 2024, compared to $4.4 million in 2023, likely in response to a high realized gas price of $4.69/mcf in 2023. This did in fact result in a roughly 50% production increase, which was confounded by realized gas prices thereafter falling 56%. Accordingly, the Trust had amassed a capital deficit of over $20 million by the end of 2024. This resulted in the suspension of dividends, and an exodus of yield-oriented investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are various scenarios based on projected production volumes, capital spending levels and gas prices where the distributions will be reinstated and grow to material amounts. The gas reserves and production haven't gone anywhere and, if anything, run-rate production will be higher, meaning the essential value of the assets is intact. It's just a matter of waiting for the capital deficit to be erased by ongoing royalties, which is—and this is wonderful investment tool in such instances—just a matter of waiting.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Altius Minerals Corp.</strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Altius Minerals Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ATUSF\" title=\"Altius Minerals Corporation\">OTCPK:ATUSF</a>) </strong>receives royalties from two miners that supply one-quarter of global potash and three-quarters of U.S. potash needs. Also copper and wind and solar project royalties. It's stock market value is $1.1 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To repeat an earlier compare-an-contrast observation about pure size vs. undiluted economic participation in resource scarcity value: The combined market cap of those two miners (The Mosaic Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MOS\" title=\"The Mosaic Company\">MOS</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MOS\" title=\"The Mosaic Company\">MOS</a>) and Nutrien Ltd (N<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TR\" title=\"Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc.\">TR</a>).), sometimes more profitable, sometimes less, is just under $40 billion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Mesabi Trust</strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mesabi Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSB\" title=\"Mesabi Trust\">MSB</a>) </strong>holds a royalty interest on the Northshore (iron ore) Mine in the Mesabi Range in northern Minnesota. The mine operator is Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CLF\" title=\"Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.\">CLF</a>) , an integrated iron and steelmaking company. The mine produces a specific type of high-grade iron ore that is a critical input material for electric arc furnace steelmaking. Cliffs has oriented its domestic growth strategy around electric arc furnaces and is thus highly sensitive to producing the requisite feedstock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The royalty agreement dates to 1961. The terms have never been in question until recently. Cliffs decided that it did not want to pay a royalty related to the “premium” for the high-grade ore. An arbitration panel resoundingly agreed with the Trust and awarded $72 million in residual payments in late 2024. However, the parties are now back in front of an arbitration panel for a related issue subsequent to the ruling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Cliffs attempt to circumvent the royalty agreement obscures a highly valuable iron royalty stream with decades of remaining—and low cost—reserve life. It's not difficult to calculate the current cash flow yield assuming historical mine production levels, current iron prices and the contracted premium. Fortunately, few other investors appear to take the time.</p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td> <p>Important Disclosures</p> <p>Past performance is not indicative of future results.

We spent so much time on them because<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> there's a payoff: In gold, the phenomenon of localized inflation is already apparent, but the other extractive industries will eventually have the same experience.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The financial markets won't help these companies either. Extraction-based commodity production is very capital intensive, but it is exceedingly difficult for producers to attract significant equity capital, because they can't compete with the need to raise fantastic amounts of capital for data centers and artificial intelligence projects. Would you be more likely to answer the phone for a chance to invest in: A) an iron ore mine with a payback period beginning in 10 years; or B) a datacenter developer that's up and running in a few? With little or no equity capital available to them, there's not much chance for mining companies to address a supply deficiency even if they perceive a long-term demand opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This raises three lines of related thought relative to portfolio positioning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One is that future <em>localized inflation </em>can often be anticipated with a high degree of confidence. We've seen to what great effect that understanding can be put, using the appropriate asset-light vehicle. All that's required is patience for the compounding to manifest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A second thought is that <em>scarcity value </em>can magnify the return possibilities of a localized inflation beneficiary. While Sabine Royalty (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBR\" title=\"Sabine Royalty Trust\">SBR</a>) was an astoundingly more successful beneficiary of higher oil prices and inflation than an actual extraction company like Exxon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>), scarcity value was not one of the attributes of its superior performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The additional attribute of scarcity value can apply two ways: to the asset itself; and to the security associated with it, as when a company attracts more buying interest than its stock market capitalization can support—when there aren't enough shares to go around.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A company that embodies both anticipatory localized inflation and scarcity value could be extraordinarily remunerative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A third thought is that <em>even a small-cap company </em>can control or be economically linked to an asset that is critical to—meaning a limiting factor for—a large industry. It is possible for such a small company to be the largest such in its economic sector or geographical area. In the right circumstance, it can achieve terms of trade advantage with an industry's dominant companies. Historically, superior ROE and financial performance are a function of having pricing power.</p> <figure contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Illustration of a mouse wearing a crown and holding a trumpet, with the text 'THE MOUSE THAT ROARED'.\" width=\"151\" height=\"175\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This might seem like a does-not-compute proposition in a world with an almost monomaniacal focus on the largest, most-owned companies that owe some of their preeminence to sheer scale and the market power that comes with it. But consider one illustrative out-of-the way example, and then one or two more obvious ones that, like gold, are likely to be top-of-mind in the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The out-of-the-way example is potash. Potash, you say? This is what provides potassium, one of the three essential crop nutrients, the other two being nitrogen and phosphorus. Global food production at the current scale would collapse without their near-constant application.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The rising future demand curve for crop fertilizers is based on some inexorable factors that are noticeably similar to prior discussions about why demand for oil and gas is not going to fade away any time soon:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The global population continues to rise, which proportionately requires additional fertilizers.</li> <li>Food demand rises faster than population, because rising standards of living in poorer nations come with greater caloric intake.</li> <li>Further, a higher share of that new caloric intake is from animal products and other calorie-rich foods like vegetable oils, which require incrementally more crop production than grains and legumes.</li> <li>Importantly, the amount of arable land does not increase, which means that, on a per-capita basis, cropland is in constant decline: from 4,000 square meters in the 1960s to about 2,500 sqm in 2000. 2,500 sqm is about half the size of an American football field, including the end zones. Per-capita cropland was last projected by a U.N. study to fall to 1,900 sqm by 2030.</li> <li>All of this means higher required crop yields, which will require disproportionately more fertilizer, net of other yield enhancement technologies and process improvements.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This sequential expansion function between population growth, wealth effect and fertilizer demand is shown in the accompanying chart from BHP (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BHP\" title=\"BHP Group Limited\">BHP</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BHP\" title=\"BHP Group Limited\">BHP</a>) (which mines not only metals and coal, but potash, too).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As to demand, 90% of global potash consumption is for agriculture.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As to supply, there was a decade-plus expansion to answer a demand cycle that caused prices to quintuple, peaking at $682/ton in 2009.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That expansion phase ended around 2015, when potash traded in the $300 range, but created an oversupply position that then caused prices to gradually decline through 2020, to $202.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Supply disruptions caused by the Russia sanctions temporarily caused a price spike to $1,200 in 2022 (whoopsie, demand exceeded supply!), but it quickly returned to 2015's $360 range. <sup>15</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Accordingly, prices are not high enough to induce investment in new supply and reserve replacement, so producers are availing themselves of still-extant surplus capacity. However, that excess capacity is expected to be fully utilized in the next several years...this all sound familiar?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Population up ~2.5 fold since 1960, crops ~3.5 fold, potash ~4.5 fold (Index, 1960 = 100)</strong></p> <figure contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658179171288.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart showing Population, Crop production, and Potash fertiliser demand (Index, 1960 = 100) from 1960 to 2020.

Almost 80% of U.S. potash imports comes from Canada. Canada is the world's largest supplier—at a 30%, share—and holds 45% to 60% of global reserves, depending on the calculation method.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Within Canada, three companies produce all the potash, two of which produce more than a quarter of global supply. They are asset intensive mining companies, with a host of their own cyclical and capital risks and limitations, no different than for oil or gold extraction. And, wouldn't you know it, there is actually a potash royalty company, and it gets its royalties from those two largest North American potash producers. This is Altius Minerals (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ATUSF\" title=\"Altius Minerals Corporation\">OTCPK:ATUSF</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Altius doesn't call itself a potash royalty company, because potash is a bit less than one-third of its royalty revenues. On the other hand, its Base &amp; Battery Metals royalty revenues, which are about 40% of the total, are mostly from copper, which is also very difficult to get exposure to. Another nearly 10% came from iron ore. All of these commodities share the supply/demand dynamics that have been discussed thus far. Another nearly 20% of royalties are from solar and wind power projects, almost exclusively in Texas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To get exposure to these otherwise difficult-to-isolate strategic commodities that are each steadily approaching their localized scarcity expression moments—when the demand/supply balance tips—Altius has a market value of only $1.2 billion. The combined market cap of the two potash miners, Nutrien (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTR\" title=\"Nutrien Ltd.\">NTR</a>) and Mosaic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MOS\" title=\"The Mosaic Company\">MOS</a>), is almost $40 billion. The market cap of Freeport-McMoRan (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCX\" title=\"Freeport-McMoRan Inc.\">FCX</a>), the copper miner is nearly $60 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another frame of reference for the scarcity value of a $1.2 billion company like Altius Minerals: the lowest-weight stock in the S&amp;P 500 ((SP500), (SPX)), at less than 1/100 <sup>th </sup>of one percent, is News Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NWSA\" title=\"News Corporation\">NWSA</a>).

People are still traveling, and MMYT continues to<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> execute well. In this update, I maintain my buy rating for MMYT. My view remains that the business remains fundamentally sound, and MMYT has clearly become a far more diversified business than it was even a year ago. Execution has been consistent, and the international and non-air businesses are scaling quickly. As long as MMYT continues to grow at this pace, eventually, the market will recognize that MMYT is a much stronger business than what the valuation reflects today, and the stock price should go up.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2Q26 earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MMYT <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20268185-makemytrip-limited-to-report-fiscal-2026-second-quarter-financial-and-operating-results-on#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A1\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20268185-makemytrip-limited-to-report-fiscal-2026-second-quarter-financial-and-operating-results-on#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A1\" target=\"_blank\">Q2 earnings</a> were strong, and I am puzzled why the market sold off the stock. I get that the headline figures were messy, especially the IFRS net loss of $5.7 million, which looked like a sharp decline from last year's $17.9 million profit. But this wasn't an operational problem. The loss came entirely from two non-cash items: (1) a $24.3 million notional interest expense from convertible notes and (2) a $14.3 million foreign exchange hit. If you just strip those out, adj. operating profit actually grew significantly by <a href=\"https://investors.mmtcdn.com/MMYT_6_K_2_Q_2026_Bannerless_845e01f45f.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">17.9% y/y to $44.2 million</a>. Apparently, the core business is still in very good shape.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the domestic air segment was weak, context matters here. The domestic air segment, which still accounts for ~20-25% of total revenue, was essentially flat this quarter, but despite that, MMYT still managed to deliver 20% constant-currency adj. revenue growth. This single data point says a lot. It shows that non-air and international businesses are now large enough to offset this weak segment entirely. The broader takeaway is that MMYT business has become more resilient and deserves a structurally higher multiple, as it is no longer a cyclical business tied to air travel.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">International Is Accelerating and Taking Share</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, if we look at the international segment, the outlook is a lot better, and the Q2 results lifted this segment to potentially becoming the main growth driver for MMYT. For reference, this segment now makes up 28% of total revenue. The underlying data paints an even more bullish picture. In air ticketing, international now accounts for 43% of the segment, up sharply from 37% in Q2 2025. In Hotels and Packages, the mix has risen to 23.4% from 21.4% a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, international air revenue grew 29.6% y/y in constant currency, while international hotel revenue grew 42% y/y. The international travel market is unlikely to be growing at &gt;20%, which means MMYT is winning a ton of share. There is one other data point to support this, and that is the relative air volume (international) vs. the overall market. In Q2, MMYT international air volumes grew 16% y/y, which was ~2.5x the overall market's 6% growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This performance validated my previous view that MMYT is building a moat through direct supply contracting and curated travel packages, such as the new Phu Quoc, Vietnam, offering that bundles exclusive flights. Without going deep into the details again, here is a quote from my previous update about this moat:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>MMYT's efforts over the years are now clearly paying off. It has been putting a lot of effort into expanding its international hotel supply through direct contracting, which has worked, as it now offers &gt;2,000 hotels across 50 cities in 20 countries, including a new partnership with Premier Inn (the UK's largest hotel chain). What makes this strategy so effective is its precision. Management noted these 50 cities account for more than half of India's outbound travel, meaning MMYT is doubling down where demand is strongest. The recent tie-up with Premier Inn, the UK's largest hotel chain, is a great example. This adds a well-known, value-centric brand to MMYT's portfolio in key UK destinations. More importantly, this isn't about just adding supply; the strategic element here is that by tailoring its offerings through direct relationships, MMYT can have better control of the entire experience, allowing it to design them specifically for Indian outbound travelers.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that this is a structural moat, and adoption is clearly strong, I think it is likely that MMYT will continue to see very strong growth here, lifting overall growth again even if domestic air is weak.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Market Leadership Is Funding Growth and Expanding Margins</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This quarter was another good example that MMYT is the best operator in town. Like I've mentioned, the domestic air market remained weak, but MMYT continues to hold 30%+ market share, and I take this as a validation of my earlier view that, in times of uncertainty, customers naturally gravitate toward the most trusted, full-service platform. Here is where the magic happens. Because MMYT is the leader, my belief is that it enjoys a lot of organic traffic because of its brand equity (especially in uncertain times). This gives it massive flexibility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MMYT could have let its foot off the marketing spend pedal to protect profits, but this quarter management did something even smarter. They relocated investment to capture demand in international, hotel, and bus segments, and we can see this in the data. Marketing and promotional spend grew to 5.2% of gross bookings, up from 4.6% in Q2 2025, and yet, despite this heavier spend, adj. operating profit still grew 17.9% y/y to $44.2 million. Even better, the adj. operating margin as a percentage of gross bookings expanded to 1.80%, up from 1.66% last year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reaffirmed Guidance Signals Confidence</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management reiterating their guidance is also another point that I think the market has overlooked (i.e., they just focus on the accounting noise). Think about the implications of this. In 1H2026, MMYT faced external headwinds in Q1 and domestic supply disruptions in Q2. The natural consequence is that management would have guided lower for the year. But instead, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833995-makemytrip-limited-mmyt-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">management reiterated</a> its FY 2026 adjusted revenue growth target (20s% range), which suggests that 2H2026 will see a strong acceleration to offset 1H2026 weakness.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am giving management the benefit of the doubt here because of the momentum we are seeing outside of domestic air (especially international air, which is already seeing departures that were up y/y). The recent GST cuts for hotel stays under INR 7,500 and for new bus purchases are also catalysts that should drive up demand domestically. And in fact, the 2H2026 implied guide is even more impressive if you consider the tough comps ahead (Q4 2025 benefited from the Maha-Kumbh festival).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I still think the market is missing out on MMYT here. It has proven that growth can remain strong despite the domestic air weakness, and with a more diversified growth profile, it should warrant a higher multiple vs. the past. Moreover, it is not like growth has decelerated massively. This is still a business that grows more than 20% with expanding margins. Compare this to Booking Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BKNG\" title=\"Booking Holdings Inc.\">BKNG</a>), and you would see that MMYT's 7x forward revenue multiple doesn't make much sense. BKNG trades at 6x forward revenue but only grows at 10%, and margin is basically flattish (~30-40% range). As the market looks past the recent accounting noise, and MMYT continues to grow, my view is it is only a matter of time before valuation re-rates upward again.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main risk is the ongoing domestic air supply constraint, which management expects will only recover to last year's levels in 2H 2026, not exceed them. While it is true that MMYT can rely on other businesses to drive growth, this is still a drag on the business, as domestic air is one of MMYT's core revenue drivers. A more near-term risk is the accounting noise from the 2030 convertible notes. The large non-cash interest charge creates a headline IFRS net loss that has confused investors, and if this repeats, we could see another sell-down.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I reiterate my buy rating for MMYT. I believe the market reaction to the Q2 results was not justified. The core business remains in excellent health, with &gt;20% adjusted revenue growth, expanding margins, and visible traction in international travel, hotels, and bus ticketing. The reality is that MMYT was able to offset domestic air weakness with other high-growth, higher-margin segments, and this diversification warrants MMYT to trade at a higher multiple, I believe.</p>",

Yet, the CPI tells us there is no generalized inflation. The Federal Reserve itself continuously projected a 2.5%-to-3% near-term inflation rate during these past three years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today's gold price, then, is a clear example of localized inflation. But what explains its three-year 145% price rise?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are very few historical references to gold price changes of this magnitude. In relatively recent financial history, gold rose an almost-identical 156% in an almost identical three-plus years from 1972 to 1974. That was explained by the U.S. abandonment of the gold standard.

Gold dropped 40-odd percent from its peak price in 2012. The mining companies could no longer get an adequate return on their capital. The rational response, particularly being in such an asset intensive and high-risk business, was to reduce their capital investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Gold Price From the Oversupply Position of 2012-2014</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-1761865556242194.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Line graph showing Gold Price (in $4K) from 2010 to 2024.

Total capital expenditures in the five years to 2017 were reduced by over 70%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This remedy was to simply wait for the oversupply condition to correct itself. This was a high-confidence strategy, since the global population and industrial output expands over time. If total demand increases were to come only from population growth, and if population growth were to produce demand growth on a 1:1 basis, then gold demand should have expanded 13% between 2012 and 2024. A global measure is appropriate, since gold is a global commodity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Newmont Mining (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEM\" title=\"Newmont Corporation\">NEM</a>)</strong></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th> </th> <th>Sustaining Cap Ex</th> <th>Total Cap Ex</th> <th>Global Population</th> <th>Global CPI</th> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>2012</td> <td>870</td> <td>3,152</td> <td>7,176 bill</td> <td>1,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2013</td> <td>751</td> <td>1,900</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2014</td> <td>648</td> <td>1,039</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2015</td> <td>578</td> <td>1,370</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2016</td> <td>600</td> <td>1,077</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2017</td> <td>600</td> <td>890</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2018</td> <td>600</td> <td>1,019</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2019</td> <td>955</td> <td>1,454</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2020</td> <td>933</td> <td>1,339</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2021</td> <td>985</td> <td>1,693</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2022</td> <td>1,059</td> <td>2,190</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2023</td> <td>1,574</td> <td>2,745</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>2024</td> <td>1,905</td> <td>3,324</td> <td>8,119 bill</td> <td>1,462</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Change</td> <td> </td> <td>5.5%</td> <td>13.1%</td> <td>46.2%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Source: Company's reports</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Eventually, the miners could restore some of their prior spending. Newmont's capital expenditures have finally recovered to the 2012 level. This is not a useful figure, though. The global price level—which determines how much a unit of currency can buy in terms of labor and other inputs—rose by 46% between 2012 and 2024. <sup>13 </sup>In inflation-adjusted terms, reserve development spending is still 28% below what was being spent a dozen years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Accordingly, the oversupply problem was corrected on the producer side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As to the demand side, ETFs made their impactful introduction to this asset class, too. Although with the paradoxically unintended consequence of tempering the long-term expansion plans of the gold miners.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the positive face of it, ETFs were one of the only two meaningful sources of new demand in the past decade, along with central banks. Another positive: A great part of ETF demand is for portfolio asset allocations. As an allocation decision, it will tend to be a permanent feature, unlikely to ever be zero.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, ETF holders differ from other gold buyers. They are highly price-sensitive and are undisciplined sellers. Witness, in the accompanying table, their massive selling near the bottom of the cycle in 2015; ETFs were also net sellers on the way down, in 2014. They can also put large portions of their holdings on the market at a moment's notice.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global Gold Demand: 10 Year Change</h4> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th>Category(figures in tonnes)</th> <th>2015</th> <th>June 2025(trail. 12 Mos.)</th> <th>DemandChange</th> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>Jewelry Fabrication</td> <td>2,479.3</td> <td>1,853.0</td> <td>(626.3)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total Bar and Coin</td> <td>1,087.1</td> <td>1,226.8</td> <td>139.7</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Central Banks</td> <td>579.6</td> <td>1,229.7</td> <td>650.1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>ETFs(123.6)</td> <td> </td> <td>507.4</td> <td>631.0</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Technology</td> <td>338.0</td> <td>324.7</td> <td>(13.3)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Total</td> <td>4,360.4</td> <td>5,141.6</td> <td>781.2+18%</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a vanguard of the financialization of the markets, ETFs might now be the marginal gold buyer and seller, the short-term price setter, just as they are in the stock market. The largest three gold ETFs hold 1,678 metric tonnes of gold. That is twice the increase in global demand over the past decade. It's a third of annual global demand. And contrary to the ordinarily understood laws of supply and demand, the mere existence of ETFs is creating incentives for gold miners to <em>not </em>produce gold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is because a sober mining company management cannot respond as it once might have to an apparent increase in demand, if that demand is from ETF buyers. The miner must maintain a disciplined production profile to avoid the severe financial repercussions of committing long-term production capital in response to a very fidgety buyer. Fidgety: The $125 billion SPDR Gold Trust (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLD\" title=\"SPDR® Gold Shares ETF\">GLD</a></span>) shares turn over every 25 days.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this circumstance, there is little incentive to consistently increase production. An ETF holder can decide to sell a loss position and reinvest the proceeds in something else; it takes a minute. The gold mining company can't just \"take a loss\" on its real-asset investments and redeploy that capital into another business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618655562534783.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Cartoon by Rubes By Leigh Rubin, titled 'ARE WE THERE YET?,' showing several people sitting and talking, with a speech bubble saying 'ARE WE THERE YET?'.

In 2020, Newmont Mining adopted a stated goal of reducing such emissions by 32% for the ensuing 10 years. But gold mining's carbon footprint is not just a matter of powering the machinery to extract ore. The ore must be smelted in a furnace under intense heat, not so different in that sense than steel production, which necessarily involves an intense use of carbon. There isn't a way to reduce CO <sub>2 </sub>emissions by 2% to 3% a year without limiting production increases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All these factors—the oversupply position a decade ago, introducing climate change goals into production planning, and the demand/supply uncertainty around the financialization of the gold market—has had a clearly observable impact on production. Capital expenditures peaked in 2015, and global mine production has been flat ever since.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is also the fact that ore grades (the proportion of gold in the rock extracted in the mining process) are declining materially. The average gold grade was 1.31 g/t Au in 2022, down 13.4% since 2012, <sup>14 </sup>and poised to fall further as miners expand into deeper/lower quality mine plans. This not only increases the all-in sustaining cost for mine break-evens, but is considerably more carbon intensive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-1761865556196639.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Bar chart titled 'Mine production of gold worldwide from 2010 to 2024 (in metric tons)'.

Demand has gradually caught up to the level of available supply. But, there won’t be sustained new supply from the mining sector. Even if only from a basic engineering and permitting perspective, new mine production of significance can’t just be “ramped up” on a dime; not even in a decade. As just discussed, it’s unlikely to happen on a corporate policy basis, either.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When supply can’t be increased in the face of higher demand, even if the incremental demand is modest, price becomes the balancing factor, and those price changes can be truly disproportionate. We’re calling that localized inflation, because it's completely uncorrelated with the ordinary systemic factors like national monetary policy or the general inflation rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For all of this discussion about mining companies and gold, at Horizon Kinetics we bought neither. We bought gold royalty companies, like Franco Nevada Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/F\" title=\"Ford Motor Company\">F</a>NV). and Wheaton Precious Metals (W<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PM\" title=\"Philip Morris International Inc.\">PM</a>). The gold royalty company only makes an investment once. Upon recovering its initial investment, its subsequent return on capital is nearly astronomical.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Unlike the metal, the royalty company has an ongoing high-level ROE, even when the gold price is not rising, so a financial return is always being earned.</li> <li>Unlike the miner, there are no capital expenditure requirements and virtually no operating expense.

However, even if<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> there were such a policy, the risk to—or investment opportunity for—any individual is more likely to be </span><strong class=\"paywall-full-content\">localized inflation </strong><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">, meaning local to a specific commodity or locale or one very narrow segment of the economy, rather than generalized inflation.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For instance, if the price of oil were to soar, as happened in the 1970s, you might think to mitigate the problem by owning appropriately sized investments in the oil industry. Here's how that would play out:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <em>The Capital Preservation Risk: </em>If you spend 5% of disposable income on petroleum-related products like gasoline, heating oil and natural gas, then, all else constant, a doubling of oil prices would reduce your disposable income by 5%.</li> <li> <em>Ostensible Solution: </em>Allocate 5% of your investment portfolio to petroleum producers. Then—if the portfolio is at least the size of your annual spending and saving—it would increase enough to offset the energy-based loss of purchasing power.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This might seem like a logical course of action, but in practice, that strategy failed. There is a vast difference between owning a corporation that drills for oil, and owning the cash flow directly connected to the price and production volume of oil. A lot happens in a corporation's income statement between the revenue line and the net income line. Also on the balance sheet, and between the starting and ending valuation multiples of the corporation's shares. That strategy worked this way...</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Oil averaged $1.82 per barrel in 1972, and by 1974 increased over five-fold to $11.</li> <li>The price of Exxon at year-end 1972 was $2.73 per share (adjusted downward to reflect stock splits), but by year-end 1974 had declined by 26% to $2.02.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While ExxonMobil (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>) is a hedge against inflation in theory, in practice any meaningful inflationary trend is likely to be accompanied by higher interest rates. Higher rates reduce the value of most capital assets. This is rational, since the company's reserves replacement costs will increase, perhaps substantially—everything from labor and equipment to new land leases and reserves. Thus, an Exxon investor will never have access to the entirety of the company's putative earnings, the woulda coulda shoulda earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the long-term share price of ExxonMobil—one of the best-performing energy companies—is clearly <em>correlated </em>with the price of oil, it does not seem to outperform oil. Particularly when it would be most helpful, during an oil price spike. This can be seen in the accompanying chart, spanning 23 years from a then-relative low in oil prices to a recent relative high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A better way to benefit from localized oil price inflation is through an oil royalty trust. Perhaps the best example, because of the longevity of its record, is Sabine Royalty Trust (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBR\" title=\"Sabine Royalty Trust\">SBR</a></span>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Between year-end 1999 and October 2025, oil rose from $26.91 a barrel to $58.51, or by 2.17x.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>During that period SBR appreciated from $14.50 per share to $69.81, nearly a 5.2x increase, exclusive of dividends.</li> <li>The dividends received during those 25 years totaled $96.42, or 7.2x the 1999 SBR share price.</li> <li>Summed, over a 12-fold return for SBR unit holders.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, Sabine Royalty has obviously not self-liquidated. Although net royalty acres are fixed at inception, advances in petroleum geology engineering mean that as of 2024, SBR's proved oil and gas reserves are substantially higher than in 1999, despite all the production from those reserves over the course of those 25 years, and despite Sabine Royalty incurring no capital expenditures for 25 years.</p> <figure contenteditable=\"false\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618655562578866.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Line chart titled 'WTI Crude Oil vs Exxon (&lt;span&gt;XOM&lt;/span&gt;) vs Sabine Royalty Trust (&lt;a href='https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBR' title='Sabine Royalty Trust'&gt;SBR&lt;/a&gt;)'.

Because the cash flow is distributed monthly, with no reinvestment requirement, oil or natural gas price increases will automatically be translated in short order to distributable income. Its business model is to just collect royalty checks, pay the 0.7% of revenues (!) it incurs in administrative costs, and send the remaining 99.3% to unit holders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That makes it a suitable hedge against oil and gas price increases. Nor need one anticipate inflation to make good use of such an instrument—it's not a binary win-or-lose choice. One merely prepares for the possibility of localized inflation and receives a robust cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As to how much can happen on an income statement between the revenue and net income line, a side-by-side picture of the ExxonMobil and Sabine Royalty income statements shows you what you need to know. <em>Importantly, the fact that one of them is very, very large, and the other is very, very small is completely irrelevant to their inherent profitability or value as hedges against higher energy prices.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>ExxonMobil Income Statement</strong></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th>(millions of dollars)</th> <th>NoteReferenceNumber</th> <th>2024</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Revenues and other income</strong></td></tr> <tr> <td>Sales and other operating revenue</td> <td>18</td> <td>339,247</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Income from equity affiliates</td> <td>7</td> <td>6,194</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Other income</td> <td></td> <td>4,144</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Total revenues and other income</strong></td> <td></td> <td><strong>349,585</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Costs and other deductions</strong></td></tr> <tr> <td>Crude oil and product purchases</td> <td></td> <td>199,454</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Production and manufacturing expenses</td> <td></td> <td>39,609</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Selling, general and administrative expenses</td> <td></td> <td>9,976</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Depreciation and depletion (includes impairments)</td> <td>2,9</td> <td>23,442</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Exploration expenses, including dry holes</td> <td></td> <td>826</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Non-service pension and postretirement benefit expense</td> <td>17</td> <td>121</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Interest expense</td> <td></td> <td>996</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Other taxes and duties</td> <td>19</td> <td>26,288</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Total costs and other deductions</strong></td> <td></td> <td><strong>300,712</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Income (loss) before income taxes</strong></td> <td></td> <td><strong>48,873</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Income tax expense (benefit)</td> <td>19</td> <td>13,810</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Net income (loss) including noncontrolling interests</strong></td> <td></td> <td><strong>35,063</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests</td> <td></td> <td>1,383</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Net income (loss) attributable to ExxonMobil</strong></td> <td></td> <td><strong>33,680</strong></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sabine Royalty Trust Income Statement</strong></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th></th> <th>2024</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Royalty income</td> <td>$ 82,569,642</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Interest income</td> <td>601,454</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Total</strong></td> <td><strong>83,171,096</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>General and administrative expenses (Note 6)</td> <td>3,528,402</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Distributable income</td> <td><strong>$ 79,642,694</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>Distributable income per unit (Basic and Assuming Dilution)(14,579,345 units) (Notes 1,2)</td></tr> </tbody> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td> <p></p> <p>Important Disclosures</p> <p>Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Put another way, the sourcing universe is stocks from the European Union, and includes countries such as Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EZU passively covers MEI through a process known as representative sampling. For those not familiar with the concept, it means that rather than the former identically mirroring the latter in terms of coverage and individual stock exposure, and thus encountering higher administrative and trading costs, the goal is to just pick a sample of stocks, which in total have the same qualities (in terms of risk-reward profile, the market-cap breakup, etc) as the latter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EZU’s tracking strategies are working pretty well because the tracking errors across different durations are generally lower than what most ETFs encounter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257639597816_origin.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"909\" data-height=\"528\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257639597816_origin.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Tracking error\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"372\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257639597816_origin.jpeg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257639597816_origin.jpeg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257639597816_origin.jpeg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257639597816_origin.jpeg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257639597816_origin.jpeg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257639597816_origin.jpeg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257639597816_origin.jpeg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257639597816_origin.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>How Does EZU Compare To Its Largest Peer- VGK?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When investors are looking for diversified exposure to stocks across Europe, they are typically directed towards the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VGK\" title=\"Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF\">VGK</a>). VGK’s supreme popularity can be gleaned from the quantum of AUM (assets under management) that it has managed to procure; to elaborate, despite getting listed nearly 5 years after EZU, VGK has still managed to accumulate total AUM of<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VGK\"> over $35B</a>, which is over 4x more than EZU. Both these products are, of course,<a href=\"https://etfdb.com/etfdb-category/europe-equities/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> the largest European ETFs</a> so let’s dive in and see which of the two is more well-rounded.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note that VGK, like EZU, is also passively managed, but tracks a different index called the <em>FTSE Developed Europe All Cap Index [FDEACI].</em> The main takeaway from the respective tracking indices is that FDEACI and VGK are broader in reach, covering close to 1250 stocks, which is 5.5x the number of stocks that EZU/MEI cover.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Crucially, VGK offers exposure to stocks in the United Kingdom, which is also its top geographical region. Since EZU is oriented around stocks that use the euro currency, it shuns UK stocks, with French stocks accounting for the largest stake (over 31%, which is more than 2x the exposure that VGK provides). EZU also offers almost double the German equity exposure that VGK provides.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The tracking indices of both ETFs are market-cap weighted, so there will be a tilt towards the largest stocks, but based on their respective average market-caps ($77B for EZU and $54B for VGK), we can infer that EZU gravitates towards the largest giant caps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We’d like to believe that one of the key reasons for VGK’s superior popularity (despite making a belated debut to EZU) is its much superior cost-efficiency. VGK is very cheaply priced, at an expense ratio of just 0.06%, whereas EZU is priced at a figure that is 8.5x higher!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even on the income front, VGK has a slight edge, yielding an annualized figure that is 40 bps more than EZU. Some investors may also be enthused to discover that VGK pays dividends more frequently (4 times a year as opposed to just twice for EZU), as they could potentially reinvest those dividends, however little, in other high-yield areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What’s common between these two ETFs is that they are both very liquid (translating to very tight spreads of 0.01%), are not prone to a great deal of churn (annual churn rates of just 3-4%), and are dominated by stocks from the financial and industrial sectors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257628317506.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Key stats\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"602\" height=\"552\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257628317506.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257628317506.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257628317506.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257628317506.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257628317506.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257628317506.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257628317506.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257628317506.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha, Morningstar</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors may also want to consider how these two products have fared over time.

This statement is music to the ears of dollar bulls, and could stall the double-digit appreciation of the EUR/USD pair in 2025. Naturally, prospective euro weakness against the dollar isn’t ideal for holders of EZU, given that its NAV is listed in USD terms but it holdings are all EUR denominated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, investors may also want to take note of EZU’s monthly price chart, which shows that it is almost at its 2007 highs, from where we previously saw a brutal correction. We are not suggesting that one will see a correction of a similar ilk but it makes little sense to cast aside this previous resistance and double-down on EZU now, particularly when the RSI indicator at the lower end of the chart, too, is almost signalling overbought conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257610343544_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1827\" data-height=\"851\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257610343544_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Monthly chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"298\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257610343544_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257610343544_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257610343544_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257610343544_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257610343544_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257610343544_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257610343544_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9658941-17618257610343544_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Investing</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To conclude, we don’t feel that EZU is worth pursuing now.</p>",
