However, I am now downgrading CLVT to hold. The business is not recovering as well as I expect it to. The segments that needed to recover (IP and LSH) continue to be weak. At ~4.8x forward PE, the stock still looks inexpensive, but in my view, it deserves the discount until management can prove that organic growth is sustainable.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings Results Review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20283699-clarivate-reports-third-quarter-2025-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A2\">CLVT Q3 2025</a> results were disappointing. The headline revenue looks good, but the underlying business is actually not doing as well. It reported total revenue of $623.1 million, which is basically flat y/y but was ahead of consensus. The reason for this beat needs attention, because it wasn’t driven by the core business. The beat came largely from several large, one-time, low-margin e-book transactions within the Academia &amp; Government [ANG] segment, which CLVT is in the process of winding down (the e-book subsegment). In other words, this one-off tailwind is unlikely to happen again. Also, the reason for the FY2025 revenue guide to be raised was because this exit is taking longer than expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On an organic basis, revenue fell 0.1% y/y, a sequential deceleration vs. the 0.5% growth in Q2 2025. Subscription revenue grew 1.2% y/y, but this was fully offset by a 3.2% decline in recurring IP renewals and a 2.8% decline in transactional revenue. By segment, ANG was the only segment that grew, with 2% y/y organic growth, but the IP business fell 2.7% y/y, and Life Sciences &amp; Healthcare [LSH] fell 0.7% y/y. As you can imagine, this impacted margins. Adj. EBITDA fell to $252.4 million from $264.4 million, with margins down 200 bps to 40.5%. Hence, at the bottom line, adj. EPS came in only at $0.18.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bull Case</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the flat organic headline performance was disappointing, there are some positive signals that supported my previous bull case. This is also why I see Q3 as a mixed bag rather than an outright miss. The most important leading indicator, in my view, remains organic annual contract value [ACV], which accelerated again to 1.6% growth. This was 1.3% in Q2, which I noted as the first real sign of a turnaround. With another quarter of improvement, ACV is now up 70 bps since FY2024, and this suggests that the current 1.2% growth in Q3’s subscription revenue can continue to accelerate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The quality of this ACV improvement is also another very bullish development. I believe the real reason for this improvement is really the pivot to a subscription-first model. We can see this in the numbers. Recurring organic revenue is now 88% of total organic revenue on a year-to-date basis, up 800 bps from 80% for FY2024. The underlying customer health is also getting better as renewal rates are now at 93%, up 100 bps y/y, which confirms that the subscription model is resonating. This is perhaps one of the clearest signs that the business model is stabilizing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even the IP segment, which has been a major drag, has started to stabilize. Yes, the Q3 organic decline was ugly, but on a year-to-date basis, recurring patent revenue is now flat versus the 3% decline in 2024. That is the type of improvement I want to see, as it suggests a bottom may be forming. Elsewhere on the AI front, I am expecting the adoption trend to continue going upwards to the right because of the new products launched. Over the past 12 months, CLVT rolled out 12 new AI-powered capabilities, and these are commercial-grade products that are valuable. Take the Derwent Patent Monitor, for example. It uses AI to assign threat ratings in IP portfolios. Essentially, it acts as a smart early-warning system that flags competitor filings that could be a risk to the organization. In the past, this was done through manually looking through thousands of new patents, which is extremely time-consuming and costly. But all this can now be done automatically, which not only cuts down labor costs but also de-risks an organization's business (that relies on their IP). Another good example is the Cortellis Regulatory Assistant, which uses conversational AI to make life easier when navigating a regulatory landscape. This is specifically useful for biopharma and medtech companies, where the regulatory landscape is complex and profound. Instead of looking through each legal note, this AI tool allows an organization to ask questions (like how you ask ChatGPT something) and receive answers in seconds. Again, over here, there will be a lot of time and cost saved.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bear Case</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now for the bear case, which is a strong one that frankly has pushed me back from bullish to neutral in the near term. The most disappointing development was that the turnaround narrative is somewhat broken. My earlier view on this recovery was based on the steady organic growth acceleration (0.3% in Q1 2025, followed by 0.5% in Q2, which I expected to continue). But this quarter, that trend turned for the worse. Total organic revenue fell -0.1% y/y, and as much as there are positive signals, this was a really huge setback that kills that recovery narrative (at least for the near-term).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bigger problem is that this organic decline was in the two segments that needed to turn around the most. Intellectual property remains the biggest drag, with organic revenue down 2.7% y/y, including a 3.2% decline in recurring patent renewals. This is very bad because it is exactly the part of the business that needs to stabilize first, yet it’s still shrinking. Think about it, the recurring patent renewals are the “base” of the business that gives recurring revenue, which CLVT can use to reinvest for growth. If that continues to shrink, the business will just be too tough to be in growth mode. The LSH segment also saw a 0.7% organic decline. While ANG is growing, it doesn’t matter because the other two segments represent the majority of adj. EBITDA, so until they recover, the earnings outlook is just not great.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618769147823124.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"569\" height=\"768\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618769147823124.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618769147823124.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618769147823124.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618769147823124.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618769147823124.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618769147823124.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618769147823124.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/62203503-17618769147823124.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All of this circles back to valuation and, more importantly, trust. I’d been vocal that the stock looked cheap, but I think it is also fair that the market remains skeptical, and Q3 proved the market right. The headline beat was not structural, and the underlying organic growth trend has turned for the worse. This certainly does not help when CLVT has a record of missing consensus estimates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, despite the stock becoming cheaper than when I wrote about it last time (now at 4.8x forward PE), I am revising my rating to hold. Until management can deliver clean, consistent core organic growth, it doesn’t matter if the ACV growth trend is positive. I don’t think that alone will move the stock. In my view, the shares will stay in this penalty box for now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I downgrade to a hold rating for CLVT. The bull case that I thought would happen failed to materialize, with the organic growth trend turning negative. While there are bright spots like a growing subscription mix, early traction from AI products, and solid retention, there is just no strong momentum in the broader turnaround. Until CLVT delivers durable organic growth, I expect the stock to remain range-bound.</p>",

This is likely reflecting investor optimism following the company’s performance in the last few quarters.</p> <p>The Q3 2025 results continued to demonstrate MPS’s structural<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> growth strength, with revenue up 18.9% year-on-year and stable margins.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would argue that these results are not merely cyclical or temporary. Rather, they stem from the structural strengths that underpin Monolithic Power Systems Inc.’s (MPS) long-term growth story.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this article, I examine the company’s performance over the past decade to uncover the underlying drivers behind its exceptional compounding record — focusing on the strategic, operational, and structural factors that continue to sustain its growth and profitability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MPS is a high-quality analog semiconductor firm with structural, organic growth driven by proprietary power-management IP, deep customer integration, and an efficient fabless model. Its exposure to data center, automotive, and industrial markets supports continued double-digit earnings growth. While financially sound with peer-leading performance, much of its strength is already priced in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Organic-driven growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MPS is a fabless analog semiconductor company generating almost all its revenue from sales of proprietary power-management ICs and modules. Its value proposition combines advanced analog design, high integration, and energy efficiency, underpinned by a strong balance sheet and asset-light manufacturing model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the past decade, the company managed to grow revenue at a 23% CAGR. Management explicitly credited its engineering-driven growth model - rather than M&amp;A or one-off demand surges - as the source of its long-term outperformance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This growth was almost entirely organic, fueled by consistent innovation, deeper customer integration, and expansion into larger, higher-value markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MPS serves the global power management IC market, a moderately growing one as exemplified by the following:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">“The global power management IC market size was estimated at USD 40,293.8 million in 2024…growing at a CAGR of 6.8% from 2025 to 2030.” <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/power-management-integrated-circuit-ic-market-report\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/power-management-integrated-circuit-ic-market-report\" target=\"_blank\">Grand View Research</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">“The global power management IC market size was valued at USD 39.39 billion in 2024…exhibiting a CAGR of 6.5% during the forecast period (2024 to 2032).<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"759366235\">\"</em> <a href=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/power-management-ic-market-110034?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/power-management-ic-market-110034?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune Business Insights</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the time horizons differ, it nonetheless illustrates that MPS’s historical revenue growth has significantly outpaced the broader market. This implied that its expansion was driven primarily by market-share gains rather than overall sector growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I will show later in the peer analysis section, MPS achieved the best revenue growth rate among the peers, supporting this market share gain picture.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moats</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that a big part of its growth was due to the following competitive advantages:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">i) Intangibles. MPS has proprietary analog and mixed-signal power-management architectures, patented process technologies, and advanced packaging IP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ii) Customer embeddedness - Deep engineering integration and long-term partnerships. Many programs are custom-tuned or co-developed. This integration raises the cost for customers to disengage and strengthens MPS’s insight into upcoming product roadmaps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">iii) Capital efficiency advantage - Fabless model. This setup allows MPS to maintain lower fixed-cost burdens, respond flexibly to demand, and reinvest more into R&amp;D. These support long-term margin resilience and innovation cycles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The above analysis suggests that the MPS growth trajectory is structural rather than cyclical, and it is likely to sustain its historical double-digit pace for some time. With China accounting for roughly half its revenue in recent years, MPS has leveraged its global presence to penetrate large, fast-evolving end markets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Higher profit growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MPS was able to leverage its high revenue growth into a much stronger profit growth. Over the past decade, operating profit and PAT grew at 34% and 55% respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart 1 provides some insights into the profit drivers. You can see that the gross profit margin (and the corresponding contribution margin) did not change much over the past decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What was significant was fixed cost control. Over the past decade, fixed cost margin declined (improved) with the 2024 margin of 33% compared to the 46% in 2015.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other characteristic of its cost structure was the high operating leverage, with fixed costs accounting for about half of the total cost (fixed + variable). This meant that additional revenue will have a multiplier impact on profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q3 2025, operating profit rose 19% year-on-year on an 18.9% revenue increase, confirming that operating leverage remains strong even as gross margins plateau near 55%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, the decade-long trend suggests an underlying efficient business model. Given the projected revenue growth discussed earlier, it is reasonable to expect that profit growth will remain strong and sustainable.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"828\" data-height=\"241\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart 1: Margins and Operating Profit Profile\" width=\"640\" height=\"186\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"186\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-1761813671283333_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Chart 1: Margins and Operating Profit Profile <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Note to Op Profit Model. I broke down the operating profits into fixed costs and variable costs.</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em>Fixed cost = SG&amp;A, R&amp;D, Depreciation <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"&amp;\" htloopnumber=\"759366235\">&amp;</em> Amortization.</em></li> <li><em>Variable cost = Cost of Sales - Depreciation and Amortization.</em></li> <li><em>Contribution = Revenue – Variable Cost.</em></li> <li><em>Contribution margin = Contribution/Revenue.</em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The PAT growth rate was higher than that for the operating profit because of the $1.2 billion tax credit in 2024. This tax credit arose mainly from share-based compensation deductions and R&amp;D-related tax incentives. The tax credit was not from one-off accounting reversals or deferred tax releases. Excluding the tax credit and assuming the “normal” tax rate, the PAT growth rate from 2015 to 2024 is about 34% CAGR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having said that, it is instructive to note that the effective tax rate over the past decade (excluding the tax credit year) was about 12%. This is much lower than the nominal tax rate because of its global footprint, tax-efficient operating structure, and recurring credits tied to R&amp;D and stock-based compensation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, the lower tax rate can be considered part of the business setup and expected to be sustained.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Peer analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I compared MPS’s performance with the following publicly listed peers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">i) Analog Devices: This is a high-performance analog/mixed-signal giant supplying precision/power solutions into industrial, automotive, and data-center systems.

From 2015 to 2024, while it generated an annual positive cash flow from operations every year, it did not have a good cash flow conversion ratio. During this period, it only generated $2.9 billion in cash flow from operations compared to its cumulative PAT of $3.4 billion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Prospects</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The outlook for MPS appears highly favorable, supported by growth drivers and sustained competitive advantages. Its historical performance has been driven by strong execution rather than cyclical tailwinds, and there is little evidence to suggest a reversal of this trajectory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">i) Market growth. Demand for power-management ICs in data centers, EVs, and industrial automation would provide long-term growth opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ii) Market share gains. Continuous innovation and customer integration should enable MPS to capture share from larger analog competitors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">iii) Margin resilience. I expect a continuation of its strong cost discipline and high operating leverage. This would support sustained profitability and scalable earnings growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">iv) Geographic diversification. While China remains its largest market, expanding exposure in North America and Europe would gradually reducing concentration risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">v) Earnings visibility. Its long-term customer programs, a debt-free balance sheet, and recurring tax benefits underpin high earnings and cash flow predictability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In sum, MPS’s prospects remain strongly positive. The company’s moats - proprietary IP, customer embeddedness, and capital efficiency - are enduring and self-reinforcing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While cyclical risks from the semiconductor demand environment cannot be ruled out, MPS’s business model is positioned to compound value structurally, not cyclically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recent results suggest that while structural growth continues, MPS’s revenue trajectory has normalized to the high-teens range, reflecting broad-based demand rather than outsized data center momentum.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The value of MPS would depend on the profit trajectory. In this context, I assumed a picture tied to its historical performance. The key assumptions are as follows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">i) The base revenue would be the 2024 revenue. Over the valuation period (Year 1 to the terminal value in Year 6), revenue would grow at 23.2% CAGR. This is about the historical growth rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ii) The base EBIT margin would be based on the 2022 to 2024 average of 27%. I assumed that this would improve proportionately so that in the terminal year, it would match the peer's best historical average of 41%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">iii) The based capital turnover would be the 2022 to 2024 average value</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">iv) The base Reinvestment would be the past decade's average Reinvestment margin. The Reinvestment rate would improve proportionately so that in the terminal year, it would follow that of the fundamental growth equation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">v) The tax rate would be the past decade's average tax rate (excluding 2024).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On such a basis I obtained an intrinsic value of $725 per share compared to the market price of $1,094 per share (29 Oct 2025). There is no margin of safety</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation model</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I value MPS based on a multi-stage valuation model as illustrated in Table 3.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"786\" data-height=\"168\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Table 3: Sample valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"137\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"137\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52417482-17618147967184536_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Table 3: Sample valuation <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Notes to Table 3.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>a.

This is because in the terminal year:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">i) MPS would deliver an EBIT margin of 44%. Its past decade high was only 29%. Given that margins appear to have stabilized (as per the Q3 2025 results) in the mid-30s operating range, my prior assumption of margin expansion toward peer highs may be very optimistic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ii) MPS would have a 101% return on capital. The peer best over the past decade was by Texas Instruments with 47% in 2018.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">iii) MPS would have an EPS of $57 per share. Its decade best was $9 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite an aggressive set of assumptions, there is no margin of safety. The market has overpriced the business.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MPS represents a rare combination of sustained organic growth, structural efficiency, and durable competitive advantages in the analog semiconductor space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the past decade, the company has compounded revenue at 23% annually, translating this into even stronger profit. This was achieved through disciplined cost control and operating leverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its competitive edge rests on proprietary power-management architectures, deep customer integration, and an asset-light, fabless model that allows consistent reinvestment into innovation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, MPS’s core markets remain structurally attractive. These - data centers, automotive, and industrial systems - are driven by rising power density, electrification, and AI-related demand. These tailwinds, combined with the company’s engineering-led culture and design-in model, support a strong likelihood of continued double-digit growth.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, from an investment perspective, much of this strength already appears priced into the stock. Even when modelled with optimistic growth and margin assumptions, intrinsic value estimates offer little to no margin of safety relative to current market levels. You can understand why I do not see this as a long-term value investing opportunity.</p>",

That makes 35 for the year so far. We had a strong finish for October after a strong showing in the traditionally weak month<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> of September.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As is customary, I will look at the various asset classes, sectors, equity categories, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and stocks that moved the market higher and the market segments that defied the trend by moving lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Identifying the pockets of strength and weakness allows us to see the direction of significant money flows and their origin. This is helpful in a trending market like we have today, as opposed to a choppy, directionless market. Once a trend gets going, it usually continues until something fundamentally changes the direction of the trend.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>S&amp;P 500 had a tepid week</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I said at the top, the market made two new high last week. With the government shutdown, a weakening employment picture, and still unresolved tariff negotiations, investors are assuming that the so-called ‘Fed put’ is still in play. But I beg to differ. With the budget deficit and national debt so high, the Fed will be reluctant to add any meaningful stimulus or do any rescuing of banks or brokers who get into trouble.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/150144-17619653989460504.png?io=w640\" alt=\"S&amp;P 500 last 4 weeks\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"482\" height=\"289\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/150144-17619653989460504.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/150144-17619653989460504.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/150144-17619653989460504.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/150144-17619653989460504.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/150144-17619653989460504.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/150144-17619653989460504.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/150144-17619653989460504.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/150144-17619653989460504.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author compilation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Zoom out to 12 months</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This chart shows the monthly returns for the past year.

A gain is a gain, as they say, but recently the market has been doing better than 0.7%. My message to Mr. Market is… Try harder! We don’t want to meander higher. We want to rocket higher, valuations be damned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of valuations, we’re getting up there. We’re close to 1999 caliber valuations. Can we surpass that ceiling? Of course we can. But be aware that there is a price to pay for buying richly valued stocks. The returns going forward hardly ever reach the highs that are achieved when starting valuations are more reasonable. It just makes intuitive sense.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>To recap the last 2 week’s action, investors were:</strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><span>Selling foreign markets and buying NASDAQ stocks</span></li> <li><span>Selling REITs and buying blockchain companies</span></li> <li><span>Selling Consumer Staples and buying Tech</span></li> <li><span>Selling dividend yield and buying high-beta stocks</span></li> <li><span>Selling Value and buying Growth</span></li> <li><span>Selling Gold &amp; Silver and buying Crude oil</span></li> <li><span>Selling France and buying Brazil</span></li> <li><span>Selling uranium and buying lithium</span></li> <li><span>Selling Defensive and buying Cyclical stocks</span></li> </ul>",

Since then, I’m not fazed at all by Talkspace’s recent rally: its acceleration in growth still paves the path for an upward multiple re-rating on a still-low base valuation, as the company continues to penetrate into more health insurance plans and boost its number of payor sessions. I’m reiterating my buy rating here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Historically, Talkspace is a stock that has generated a lot of skepticism from the markets. Investment momentum has steered away from smaller, unproven companies like Talkspace and into large cap AI plays. But now, Talkspace is showcasing a number of advantages that are becoming more difficult to ignore. In my view, here are the top reasons to be bullish on Talkspace:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Talkspace enjoys secular tailwinds in the destigmatization of mental health.</strong> More and more people are seeking talk therapy as a part of their overall wellness journey, which is leading to a substantial jump in the number of sessions conducted on the Talkspace platform.</li> <li> <strong>Great medium for talk therapy.</strong> Arguably, of all the online telehealth services, mental health is the most conducive to being conducted virtually, offering convenience for both patients and providers without sacrificing quality of care.</li> <li> <strong>Expanding coverage.</strong> The company also benefits from secular tailwinds of more health insurance plans covering mental health services.</li> <li> <strong>Expanding opportunities in psychiatry.</strong> Talkspace is expanding aggressively beyond traditional talk therapy and psychology, and widening its services to include medical psychiatry.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite its wellspring of strengths, Talkspace still trades at modest revenue multiples, as the company sits just at the cusp of improving its monetization and boosting its profitability. At current share prices near $3, Talkspace trades at a market cap of $540.9 million. After we net off the $91.6 million of cash on the company’s latest balance sheet, Talkspace’s resulting <strong>enterprise value is $449.3 million.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For FY25, Talkspace has boosted the midpoint of its revenue guidance to $226-230 million (20-23% growth), versus a wider 17-25% range previously, while also narrowing its adjusted EBITDA to a $14-16 million range that implies a 6.6% midpoint margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2206\" data-height=\"1210\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Talkspace outlook\" width=\"640\" height=\"351\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"351\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619419736620429_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Talkspace outlook <span>(Talkspace Q3 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For next year, FY26, Wall Street is expecting the company to hit $276.4 million (+21% y/y), and if we conservatively assume a ~2 point adjusted EBITDA margin expansion to 8.5% margins (in line with the company’s Q3 margins), adjusted EBITDA in FY26 would be $23.5 million. This puts Talkspace’s valuation multiples at:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>2.0x</strong> EV/FY25 revenue and <strong>1.6x</strong> EV/FY26 revenue</li> <li> <strong>30x</strong> EV/FY25 adjusted EBITDA and <strong>19x</strong> EV/FY26 adjusted EBITDA</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For a company riding multiple secular tailwinds and achieving accelerating revenue growth, I continue to see a fantastic opportunity to buy Talkspace at a still-deflated valuation. Stay long here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Download</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s now go through Talkspace’s latest quarterly results in greater detail.

Talkspace's revenue growth also accelerated seven points versus just 18% y/y growth in Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's number of payor members (that is, members who are part of a covered health plan) rose 30% y/y to 121k, while the number of payor sessions on the platform expanded at a rapid 37% y/y clip. The company is not only adding new patients, but also benefiting from increased regularity of sessions conducted on the platform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2168\" data-height=\"1208\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Talkspace payor growth\" width=\"640\" height=\"357\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"357\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17619420294345114_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Talkspace payor growth <span>(Talkspace Q3 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Psychiatry continues to be a critical growth avenue for the company, with more of the company's payor members taking advantage of these offerings. Per CEO Dr. Jon Cohen's remarks on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835792-talkspace-inc-talk-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q3 earnings call:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Payer revenue in this quarter also benefited from strength in our psychiatry business, which we relaunched earlier this year to address the needs of our high acuity users and those that need medication. As a result of these initiatives, psychiatry initial session volume increased 46% in the quarter. Further, we grew our psychiatry network of providers by nearly 50% from Q2, and we'll continue growing that part of the network given the demand trends we are seeing. We continue to focus on optimizing the internal referral funnel between therapy and psychiatry services, and we expect continued growth in the coming quarters.\"</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has also rolled out a number of AI-enabled features, including a new tool that helps patients determine their insurance eligibility. Despite the raft of growth levers that Talkspace is pulling, the company is still growing with efficiency in mind. The chart below showcases that opex remained relatively flat y/y at $22.4 million, representing 34% of revenue and a decline of 7 points y/y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2154\" data-height=\"1136\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Talkspace adjusted EBITDA\" width=\"640\" height=\"338\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"338\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-1761942063834464_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Talkspace adjusted EBITDA <span>(Talkspace Q3 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, the company's adjusted EBITDA more than doubled y/y to $5.0 million, reflecting an 8.4% adjusted EBITDA margin. In my view, Talkspace is still in the early innings of hitting its profit stride, as greater session frequency will allow Talkspace to generate substantial economies of scale on its investments in its technology platform.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Takeaways</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Talkspace may be an overlooked stock, but investors who are keen to invest in value names in an expensive stock market should take advantage of this name before its growth rate and profit expansion make it more of a mainstream company. Talkspace benefits from multiple growth levers and secular tailwinds, and is quickly becoming a household name with few at-scale competitors. Stay long here.</p>",

Historically, CRE transaction volumes in the U.S. and Europe have moved in tandem, and when gaps emerge, they tend to normalize quickly. Signs are now emerging that Europe may be on the cusp of doing just that. The number of European transactions under contract in October reached its highest level since 2022, and the Q3 2025 INREV Consensus Survey showed a meaningful rebound in investor sentiment, driven by improved financing conditions and increasing market liquidity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Year-over-year change in quarterly CRE transaction volume</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>1Q 2008–present</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1105\" data-height=\"476\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Year-over-year change in quarterly CRE transaction volume\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"276\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/55028208-17619897621644764_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr class=\"bg-g\"> <th> </th> <th>3Q25</th> <th>YTD</th> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>Office</td> <td>+5%</td> <td>+3%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Industrial</td> <td>-29%</td> <td>-8%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Retail</td> <td>-13%</td> <td>+4%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Apartment</td> <td>-24%</td> <td>-9%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hotel</td> <td>+11%</td> <td>-9%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Data Centers</td> <td>+15%</td> <td>-1%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sr. Housing</td> <td>-14%</td> <td>+41%</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Resilience in residential, early office recovery</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Residential investment was a notable bright spot of the October release, reflecting investor rotation toward counter-cyclical, supply-constrained assets. The sector’s resilience was underscored in the INREV Consensus Indicator Survey, where residential ranked as the most preferred sector in Q3 2025 for the third consecutive quarter. Reflecting this momentum, residential-focused European funds delivered top-tier total returns: +2% in Q2 and +8% year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While office investment remained close to historical lows in absolute terms, there is the emergence of some green shoots. Volumes rose 5% in Q3 and 3% YTD, with London and Paris central business districts leading the way. Prices are rebounding, and prime rents are showing notable growth in 1H25. Similar signs of stabilization are emerging in supply-constrained markets, such as Madrid and Amsterdam, as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Adjacent to the traditional real estate sectors, data centers continue to gain momentum. Transaction volumes rose by +15% in Q3 and were flat on a year-to-date basis, an impressive result given the broader market softness. Data centers increasingly blur the lines between real estate and infrastructure: they offer long-term contracted revenue, essential service functions, high barriers to entry, and leases that are based on power availability rather than traditional CRE that’s measured by the size of the usage area. These attributes make them especially attractive as Europe ramps up digital and energy infrastructure investment. As part of real estate, infrastructure, or “digital real asset” strategies, investors should expect data centers to continue seeing inflows in the quarters ahead. That said, these transactions are typically large and occur infrequently, making quarterly fluctuations volatile and not necessarily indicative of medium- to long-term trends.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Europe’s CRE market may be lagging the U.S., but momentum is building beneath the surface. With liquidity returning, investor sentiment improving, and capital flowing into resilient and forward-looking sectors such as residential, prime offices, and data centers, the foundations for recovery appear to be taking shape. If current trends persist, Europe’s transaction activity is well-positioned to accelerate into 2026, potentially closing the gap with the U.S. and emerging on firmer footing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.principalam.com/us/insights/real-estate/europe-cre-deal-volume-down-3q-green-shoots-emerge\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

Here, in the MoPay batch, lie affordable (yet<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> volatile and risky) bargains.

Thus, the Dogcatcher yield-based strategy for this MoPay group, as graded by broker estimates this month, proved 40% accurate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Estimated dividend payouts from $1000 invested in each of the ten highest-yielding stocks, plus analysts median 1yr target prices for those stocks, as reported by YCharts, produced the gain estimates below. (Note: target prices from lone analysts were not counted.)

Thus, the highest yielding stocks in any collection became known as \"dogs.\" More specifically, these are, in fact, best called \"underdogs\".</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>October Monthly Pay Dividend Data</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Three lists produce numerous actionable conclusions and several more un-numbered results. To draw these conclusions and results, September 29, 2025 closing prices and estimated annual dividends were referenced from YCharts. In the process, monthly pay equity (1) yield and (2) upside potential lists were compared and contrasted against (3) the high yield (and higher risk) MoPay CEICs/ETFs/ETNs list.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Monthly Pay Dividend Qualities</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Quarterly, Semi-Annual and Annual dividend investors anxiously await announcements from a firm, fund, or brokerage to learn if their next dividend will be higher, lower, or paid at all.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Monthly pay stocks, funds, trusts, and partnerships inform the holder every four and one third weeks by check and/or statement. If the entity reduces or suspends a payment, the holder can sell out of the investment immediately to avoid future loss of income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This advantage has been curtailed when companies suddenly cut monthly dividends to save cash. Numerous prominent MoPay firms declared dividend cuts between May and June, 2020, including: Oxford Square Capital Corp; Partners Real Estate Investment Trust; Orchid Island Capital Inc; Cross Timbers Royalty Trust; H&amp;R Real Estate Investment Trust; BTB Real Estate Investment Trust; American Finance Trust Inc; Mesa Royalty Trust; Solar Senior Capital Ltd; Ellington Financial Inc; Dividend Select 15 Corp; Chesswood Group Ltd; Sabine Royalty Trust; TORC Oil &amp; Gas Ltd; Freehold Royalties Ltd; ARC Resources Ltd; Inter Pipeline Ltd; San Juan Basin Royalty Trust; Ag Growth International.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Former MoPay top ten regular by yield. Bluerock Residential announced December 2019 it was retreating to quarterly dividend payments \"in keeping with industry tradition.\" Bluerock Residential company has since gone private and is no longer listed publicly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That \"industry tradition\" continued with Armour Residential REIT and Stellus Capital Investment Corp both transitioned to Q Pay in June, 2020. Within three months, however, both SCM and ARR returned to MoPay mode.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top yield stock for July, 2018, June 2021, and December 2023, Orchid Island Capital, released this cautionary note with its monthly dividend announcements back in 2018: \"The Company has not established a minimum distribution payment level and is not assured of its ability to make distributions to stockholders in the future.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ORC directors proceeded to back-up their words with actions cutting the dividend from $0.14 to $0.11 in February, to $0.09 in March, to $0.08 in September, 2018, and to $0.055 for May, 2020. However in August. 2020 ORC monthly dividend increased from $0.06 to $0.065 for September, October, and into 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ORC, however, currently pays a $0.12 monthly dividend (falling from $0.16 in October, 2023) and is again listed here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The U.S. stock market MoPay segment is volatile, transitive, recovering, and since 2024 has achieved recovery to near full strength. More trades in monthly pay equities are available from Canadian firms, many of which are also listed on U.S. OTC (pink sheet) exchanges.

Last month they were 4% lower. Last June they were 1% higher. The price differences are caused by the outlandishly high dividends offered by a few of the top equities or funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This month the top fund dividend is at 36.14%, whereas the top equity pays just 20.09%. Nevertheless, equities are usually cheaper than funds because equities are not loaded with the high overhead costs of fund management.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Background and Actionable Conclusions</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In June 2012 readers suggested the author include these funds, trusts, and partnerships in the MoPay article.

AI, for example, depends heavily on how quickly data centers and power grid infrastructure can be built. Widespread adoption of EVs, for its part, requires charging systems and supportive electrical grid infrastructure. Meanwhile, rising trade tensions have countries racing to expand domestic manufacturing for strategic technologies, such as AI chips and EV batteries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, supporting larger, more urban populations while mitigating impacts from climate change requires a staggering amount of infrastructure, such as modernized power grids, clean water infrastructure, and residential buildings. It is estimated that roughly half of the buildings that will need to exist globally by 2050 have yet to be constructed.<sup>3</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Through 2040, investments totaling $106 trillion may be needed to meet the world’s infrastructure needs.<sup>4</sup> Transport and logistics infrastructure have the highest projected investment requirements at $36 trillion. Energy and power infrastructure require an estimated $23 trillion, while digital infrastructure, such as data centers, could require nearly $20 trillion.<sup>5</sup> Social infrastructure, including schools, healthcare facilities, and housing, as well as waste and water, agriculture, and defense infrastructure, could also require trillions in investments.<sup> 6</sup></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global Fragmentation Creates New Development Opportunities for U.S. Manufacturing Facilities</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The boost for infrastructure development from rising trade fragmentation is particularly evident in the United States. In just the first eight months of the second Trump administration, companies announced nearly $1.25 trillion in investments to expand their U.S. manufacturing footprints.<sup>7</sup> Key drivers of this trend are rising geopolitical tensions and shifting federal policies, particularly the implementation of the administration’s extensive tariff scheme.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the announcements span a variety of industries, much of the planning pipeline is concentrated in strategic areas. Consumer electronics leads with more than $700 billion in announced U.S. investments, although the category is heavily concentrated in just two companies.<sup>8</sup> Pharmaceutical manufacturing investments total $290 billion across 18 announcements from both domestic and international drugmakers. Semiconductor manufacturers account for 11% of announced investments, with plans to spend $134 billion on top of the $300 billion announced prior to 2025.<sup>9,10</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of July 2025, construction spending on manufacturing accounted for just under 15% of total private construction spending in the United States, a 2.5x increase from January 2021.<sup>11,12</sup> We believe the flurry of investments over 2025 could push manufacturing’s share of construction spending higher over the medium to long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"4270\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251010 - Charting Disruption_02-2.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"820\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-2.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aging Infrastructure Is a Common Concern for Developed Economies, Including the United States</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Decades-old assets can slow economic growth and hamper the adoption of disruptive technologies. For example, even though electricity can be viewed as essential to economic and social progress, power grids are frequently underfunded and outdated.<sup>13</sup> In Japan, over two-thirds of transmission infrastructure is at least 20 years old. Nearly half of all transmission infrastructure in the United States and over 40% of assets in the European Union are also at least two decades old.<sup>14</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the United States, inadequate infrastructure conditions extend well beyond the power grid. Despite increased funding over the past four years, the American Society of Civil Engineers only improved the country’s overall infrastructure grade from a C- in 2021 to a C in 2025.<sup>15</sup> Half of the assessed categories received either a D or D+, translating to “Poor, At Risk” status. This means that these nationwide systems are in fair to poor condition and “mostly below standard, with many elements approaching the end of their service life.”<sup>16</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Improving the quality of infrastructure in the United States alone could require $9.1 trillion in investments between 2024 and 2033. Over $5 trillion in funding has been allocated, meaning that a multi-trillion-dollar investment gap still needs to be filled by additional public and private spending.<sup>17</sup> Similarly, the European Union faces a $2 trillion infrastructure investment gap when considering expected infrastructure development needs and announced funding through 2040.<sup>18</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"3514\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251010 - Charting Disruption_03-1.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-1.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Infrastructure Renaissance Could Emerge from Surging Public and Private Investment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global infrastructure development is increasingly pivotal to the economies of the future. The adoption of disruptive technologies such as AI, the reshoring of strategic supply chains, and the growth of urban populations all depend on how quickly supportive infrastructure can be built. As these demands rise, so too could opportunities for companies – and investors – across the infrastructure development value chain. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Green, A., Nangia, J. &amp; Sandri, N.

However, it isn't just going out and buying<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a fund at the largest discount and hoping for the best—though with activist investors on the prowl, that can pay off occasionally. Where the real opportunities open up is generally on a fund's relative discount to its historical past.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In shorter periods, we can see some tactical plays as funds that dip to wide discounts can spring back. Over the longer term, can also be a pretty solid guide, though one always has to consider the current environment or any other potentially fundamental changes that a CEF has undergone. Today, we are looking at two funds that get our 'Buy' rating based on their attractive discount levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further, almost all CEFs have a focus on generating relatively higher distribution yields to their investors. With that, both of these names that we are touching on today also deliver monthly distributions to help generate passive monthly cash flow for their shareholders.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">#1 XAI Octagon Floating Rate &amp; Alternative Income Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XFLT\" title=\"XAI Octagon Floating Rate &amp; Alternative Income Trust\">XFLT</a>)</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>1-Year Z-score: -2.51</li> <li>Premium/Discount: -14.14%</li> <li>Distribution Yield: 17.07%</li> <li>Expense Ratio: 3.59%</li> <li>Leverage: 38.19%</li> <li>Managed Assets: $705.5 million</li> <li>Structure: Perpetual</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://xainvestments.com/funds/funds-floating-rate-alternative-income-term-trust-xflt\" rel=\"nofollow\">XFLT's objective</a> is to \"seek attractive total return with an emphasis on income generation across multiple stages of the credit cycle.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They will do this through \"a dynamically managed portfolio of floating-rate credit instruments and other structured credit investments within the private markets. Under normal market conditions, the Trust will invest at least 80% of managed assets in senior secured loans, CLO debt, and equity.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">XFLT is invested in a hybrid allocation of collateralized loan obligations, both equity and debt tranches. The fund is then also allocated to a higher composition of senior loan exposure. The CLO space has been getting rocked, and even senior loans have been facing pressure due to the Fed starting to cut rates again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709608022153_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"XFLT Asset Allocation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"259\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709608022153_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709608022153_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709608022153_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709608022153_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709608022153_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709608022153_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709608022153_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709608022153_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">XFLT Asset Allocation <span>(XA Investments)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the underlying investment instruments are floating-rate-based investments, these are going to see less income generation moving forward with each Fed cut. That's why we've been seeing funds in this space start to adjust their distributions lower—simply unwinding the distribution increases they had seen previously. I wouldn't be too surprised to see additional cuts here either, as the Fed is projected to continue a downward path to their target rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709626960011_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"XFLT Distribution History\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"274\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709626960011_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709626960011_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709626960011_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709626960011_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709626960011_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709626960011_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709626960011_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-1760709626960011_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">XFLT Distribution History <span>(CEFConnect)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As somewhat of a bonus, thanks to the massive discount that has opened up for the fund, now the actual distribution rate on the NAV comes to 14.66%. That means the portfolio has to generate a materially lower level than what the market price reflects at over 17%. Of course, to reiterate, nearly 15% yield is still quite elevated, and further cutting is likely necessary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further pressure has come in the form of credit issues. These underlying instruments, and where XFLT focuses, are in junk-rated territory. That makes them some of the riskiest, and then you put the leverage that is employed by XFLT on top of that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of leverage on the fund, the publicly traded 6.5% Series 2026 Term Preferred Shares (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XFLT.PR.A\" title=\"XAI Octagon Floating Rate &amp; Alternative Income Trust 6.50% SERIES 31/03/2026 TERM PREF SHS\">XFLT.PR.A</a>) were <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001703079/000121390025098196/ea0260993-01_8k.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">called</a>, with the redemption date on October 31, 2025. This was as they were <a href=\"https://xainvestments.com/knowledge-bank/news/?url=pressrelease-funds-20251001\" rel=\"nofollow\">able to issue a private placement</a> of Mandatory Redeemable Preferred Shares with a 5.92% fixed rate. A slightly lower rate can mean a bit of easing on their borrowing costs, relatively speaking. However, a greater amount is now outstanding, so on an absolute basis, borrowing costs will rise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With all that said, there are real risks to consider with this fund, and the outlook isn't all roses and sunshine. On the other hand, it is priced in the dumps now, and that makes it look quite appealing for a longer-term investor to consider starting to add further or take an initial stake.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_394dad56c1e11c3d689367f554dbcc0b.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"424\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_394dad56c1e11c3d689367f554dbcc0b.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_394dad56c1e11c3d689367f554dbcc0b.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_394dad56c1e11c3d689367f554dbcc0b.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_394dad56c1e11c3d689367f554dbcc0b.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_394dad56c1e11c3d689367f554dbcc0b.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_394dad56c1e11c3d689367f554dbcc0b.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_394dad56c1e11c3d689367f554dbcc0b.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_394dad56c1e11c3d689367f554dbcc0b.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>YCharts</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When the pain stops is anyone's guess. I personally started to add too early, but that's why I've taken a more cautious approach with dollar-cost averaging in, rather than taking a substantial stake all at once. I also continue to reinvest the monthly payout, which will further add a bit every month. As shares sink lower into penny stock territory (below $5 per share), it is possible that they conduct a reverse split, like we saw from Oxford Lane Capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OXLC\" title=\"Oxford Lane Capital Corporation\">OXLC</a>) recently.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">#2 Flaherty &amp; Crumrine Preferred Income Opportunity Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFO\" title=\"Flaherty &amp; Crumrine Preferred Income Opportunity Fund\">PFO</a>)</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>1-Year Z-score: 2.48</li> <li>Discount/Premium: -6.36%</li> <li>Distribution Yield: 6.33%</li> <li>Expense Ratio: 1.41% (4.72% including leverage expenses)</li> <li>Leverage: 37.20%</li> <li>Managed Assets: $216 million</li> <li>Structure: Perpetual</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.preferredincome.com/pfo-overview/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PFO's investment objective</a> is \"to provide its common shareholders with high current income consistent with preservation of capital.\" To achieve this, they will invest, \"under normal market conditions, at least 80% of its managed assets in a portfolio of preferred and other income-producing securities. Preferred and other income-producing securities may include, among other things, traditional preferred stock, trust preferred securities, hybrid securities that have characteristics of both equity and debt securities, contingent capital securities, subordinated debt, and senior debt.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other side of XFLT, we have PFO, a fund primarily invested in preferred securities but also contingent convertible (AT1 bonds) securities as well. Where higher short-term rates helped to boost funds like XFLT to see higher income generation within their portfolio, it hurt preferred investments that are largely fixed-rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While XFLT has some fixed-rate borrowings, PFO is also leveraged, but all of its borrowings are floating-rate. They chose not to hedge their borrowings as other fund sponsors had. Looking back, that was clearly the wrong step, but hedging also comes with a cost. Had rates not been so aggressively hiked, it could have led to outperformance, as it had historically done for them not to be hedged.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So they saw their borrowing costs rise while the underlying fixed-rate yields stayed...well...fixed. They had some fixed-to-float exposure, but that primarily only helps over the longer term, as they can take years to kick in to the floating rate part—at which time, the issuer often calls it and replaces it if they can for a cheaper issuance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Needless to say, that meant less income leftover to support a distribution, and we saw many distribution cuts while rates were rising aggressively—as the portfolio also tanked lower, creating a double-whammy. However, the distribution has now been going back up. It has been a slow process, but the rate cuts have been a much slower process compared to the most aggressive rate hiking cycle we've seen in decades from the Fed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-17607098691686764_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PFO Distribution History\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"274\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-17607098691686764_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-17607098691686764_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-17607098691686764_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-17607098691686764_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-17607098691686764_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-17607098691686764_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-17607098691686764_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/1058901-17607098691686764_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">PFO Distribution History <span>(CEFConnect)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current distribution rate of 6.33% can be compared to the 5.91% NAV rate. The discount here isn't as substantial as XFLT, but any discount will help to 'juice' the market yield relative to the NAV rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the period of aggressive rate hikes, sending the payout lower along with a NAV heading lower, as the fund's share price was tanking into a deep discount. That exacerbated the actual pain that investors felt, as the fund had previously traded at a premium regularly. So that was more like a triple-whammy that investors got in this fund.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That is, risk of investing in a CEF is that a discount/premium can work against you, as a discount can always move even wider—or, in this case, a premium drops to a material discount. Though even that discount has been starting to narrow now that rates have mostly stabilized and the Fed has once again begun to cut its benchmark rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_7d92a353b61032b943eaaf033fab34b3.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"424\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_7d92a353b61032b943eaaf033fab34b3.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_7d92a353b61032b943eaaf033fab34b3.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_7d92a353b61032b943eaaf033fab34b3.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_7d92a353b61032b943eaaf033fab34b3.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_7d92a353b61032b943eaaf033fab34b3.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_7d92a353b61032b943eaaf033fab34b3.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_7d92a353b61032b943eaaf033fab34b3.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/17/saupload_7d92a353b61032b943eaaf033fab34b3.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>YCharts</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund has seen its discount narrow quite impressively since the double-digit levels, but it still remains historically attractive. Particularly on a short-term basis, we see an elevated 1-year z-score. With that, I wouldn't be adding too aggressively here, but once again, take a dollar-cost average approach.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's also worth noting that about 50% of the fund is invested in BBB or above credit quality, making it tilt toward a relatively higher quality portfolio that should pose relatively less credit risk. Instead, it is a more interest rate-sensitive fund, as we've touched on.</p>",

Surging AI adoption – resulting in the need for power-intensive data centers – is one of the most notable tailwinds to emerge in recent years. Rising global fragmentation, leading to renewed efforts to expand manufacturing capacity outside of China, is expected to boost industrial electricity consumption. Simultaneously, shifting demographics, climate change, and the electrification of transport and heat are driving power demand growth from consumer appliances and electric vehicles. These dynamics could create sizeable opportunities for companies involved in the electricity and grid infrastructure value chain.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6667\" data-height=\"3344\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251010 - Charting Disruption_01-2.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"642\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-2.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Takeaways</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Global electricity demand could grow by 13,300 terawatt hours (TWh) through 2040, which is nearly equivalent to the current electricity consumption of China and the United States combined.<sup>2</sup> </li> <li>Data centers are an increasingly significant driver of power demand growth. By 2035, global data center electricity use could rival the power needs of large economies.<sup>3,4</sup> </li> <li>Many utilities around the world will likely need to expand power generation and grid infrastructure assets, an undertaking that could require $15 trillion in investments through 2035.<sup>5</sup> </li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Power Industry Is Poised for a Dramatic Transformation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global electricity demand is forecast to skyrocket 50% by 2040.<sup>6</sup> This robust outlook largely stems from three key drivers: the ongoing buildout of power-intensive data centers, the electrification of heat and transport, and an anticipated expansion of manufacturing activity in major economies like the United States. At the same time, traditional electricity growth drivers, such as population growth and expanded air conditioning use, are expected to contribute to higher electricity use around the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China is expected to remain the largest electricity consumer, with demand forecast to rise from 8,778TWh in 2024 to nearly 14,000TWh by 2040.<sup>7</sup> India’s electricity use could more than double from 1,617TWh to 3,474TWh over the same period. Although the United States is forecast to experience the third largest jump, its power market is undergoing a dramatic shift.<sup>8</sup> Over the next 15 years, U.S. electricity demand is forecast to increase between 35% and 50%, a substantial reversal from near-flat growth over the past 20 years.<sup>9,10</sup></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global Data Center Power Demand Could Grow More Than 4x Between 2024 and 2035</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data centers have emerged as a driving force of rising power demand forecasts around the world. A key reason behind this surge is the growing adoption of generative AI, as large language models often consume large amounts of electricity. For example, a single ChatGPT query can require roughly 10 times the energy of a typical Google search.<sup>11</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The three major economies driving the AI race are expected to account for the majority of global data center growth. The United States is forecast to remain the leading market, with demand projected to rise from 141TWh in 2024 to nearly 430TWh by 2035.<sup>12</sup> China could add just over 300TWh of electricity demand from data centers, while Europe could add nearly 100TWh.<sup>13</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Globally, data center power demand is forecast to increase from 371TWh in 2024 to 1,596TWh in 2035.<sup>14</sup> This level would mean that within a decade, the global data center fleet could require more power than many large economies consumed in 2024, including Brazil, Japan, and Russia.<sup>15,16</sup> By 2035, data centers could account for 4.5% of global electricity use, up from a 1.4% share in 2024.<sup>17</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6667\" data-height=\"3975\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251010 - Charting Disruption_02-3.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"763\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-3.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Modernizing Power Infrastructure Can Create a Multi-Trillion Dollar Opportunity</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In many countries, growing electricity needs are compounding at a time when utilities also face mounting security risks from cyberattacks, shifting grid dynamics, and extreme weather. For example, in 2024, Hurricanes Milton and Helene created significant disruptions to power grid infrastructure in the Southeastern United States.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Solving these challenges will likely require trillions of dollars in investments across a variety of power sources, including renewable energy, short- and long-term energy storage, nuclear power, and natural gas. Solar power, wind power, and battery energy storage are forecast to account for a combined 92% of global electricity capacity additions between 2025 and 2040.<sup>18 </sup>Tech advancements, cost-competitiveness, favorable policies, and corporate power purchases support the robust outlooks for the renewables industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The forecasted capacity expansion for nuclear power is smaller, but it is likely to remain a vital solution, particularly for data center operators. Since 2024, the tech sector has emerged as a burgeoning market for traditional and next-gen nuclear power purchase agreements (PPAs).<sup>19</sup> In June 2025, for example, Constellation and Meta signed a 20-year PPA for the 1,121-megawatt (MW) Clinton nuclear power plant in Illinois to support Meta’s operations, beginning in 2027.<sup>20</sup> Also in June, Amazon and Talen Energy signed a 1,920MW PPA to use the utility’s Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania to power Amazon Web Services' (AWS) data centers in the region.<sup>21</sup> Small modular reactor (SMR) developers, such as Oklo and NuScale, also signed agreements to supply power to data centers in the future.<sup>22,23</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In total, nearly $15 trillion in global investments could be required for electricity generation facilities and power grid infrastructure through 2035, with the largest investments expected for renewables and power grids.<sup>24 </sup>By 2050, total investment needs for power grids are projected to more than double.<sup>25</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6667\" data-height=\"3654\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251010 - Charting Disruption_03-2.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"702\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_03-2.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Power Is Pivotal to the Modern Economy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The advancement of disruptive technologies, such as AI and electric vehicles, requires an unprecedented power capacity expansion. Meeting future power needs likely calls for large-scale deployment of available technology, including nuclear power, renewables, cutting-edge energy storage systems, and hydrogen-powered solutions. For investors, we believe this transformation of the global power network presents powerful, long-term opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Hostert, D., Kimmel, M., Berryman, I., Pegios, K., Quintero, R., Song, S., Verma, A., &amp; Vasdev, A.

Since then, the stock has surged 113%, reflecting growing conviction in its execution and financial strength. The company raised 2025 guidance<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to $82–$100 million, beat Q2 revenue by 15%, and secured a $1 billion investment from Susquehanna, boosting cash to $1.68 billion.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ahead of Q3 2025 earnings next week, with revenue expected to rise over 117% year-over-year, IonQ’s focus shifts from proving technology to scaling commercialization through Oxford Ionics, Lightsynq, and early networking deployments that could define the next phase of quantum monetization.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, I maintain a hold rating, accumulating on pullbacks, recognizing IonQ’s technological leadership while noting that its extended valuation limits substantial upside in the near to medium term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expanding the Quantum Empire</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IonQ posted a revenue of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4809906-ionq-inc-ionq-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">$20.7 million for the Q2 2025</a>, thus beating the estimate by a margin of 15%. This may be justified based on the acceleration of projects for the U.S. Department of Energy and Air Force Research Laboratory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The purchases of Oxford Ionics and Lightsynq fundamentally changed IonQ’s technological roadmap. Oxford Ionics brings ion-trapping on a chip that allows for the integration of millions of qubits with current silicon manufacturing, while Lightsynq provides photonic interconnects to connect these chips in modular group configurations to allow for the achievement of IonQ’s roadmap of 800 logical qubits in 2027 and <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/331/114331/original.pdf\">80,000 in 2030</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1868\" data-height=\"1048\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"2025 Analyst Day\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606343205_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>2025 Analyst Day</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was addressed by Oxford Ionics’ co-founder, Chris Ballance, who pointed out that<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4822690-ionq-inc-ionq-analyst-investor-day-transcript\"> 95% of the hardware overlaps</a> with IonQ’s existing designs, so there is immediate access to mature fabrication processes and ‘trillions in prior semiconductor R&amp;D,’ giving IonQ a substantial cost advantage, with IonQ’s expected logical qubit cost being one to two orders of magnitude lower than others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IonQ, on the other hand, has expanded far beyond the realm of computation. The addition of the ID Quantique and Capella contracts has cemented IonQ’s place in not only computation but also in earth-based networks and satellite communications as well, as the only company with functioning technology in all three areas. The QKD solutions offered by IDQ are currently safeguarding information for world governments and financial institutions, while the satellites from Capella Technology Corporation will offer worldwide secure entanglements.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">IonQ Q3 2025 Preview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IonQ is expected to announce third-quarter earnings for the year 2025 on November 5, projecting revenues of $26.99 million and EPS of -$0.44 compared to over 117% growth from the previous year during the same period. Notably contributing to the company’s excellent performance in Q2, where it beat Street estimates by posting revised <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4809906-ionq-inc-ionq-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">full-year revenue estimates within the band of $82 to $100 million</a>, the company’s balance sheet remains strengthened at $1.68 billion in cash after receiving an equity investment of $1 billion from Susquehanna.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Momentum is expected to continue while IonQ converts the backlog related to contracts with the government, hyperscalers, and enterprises by integrating Oxford Ionics and Lightsynq to further advance the hardware roadmap. The company is targeting 800 logical qubits in 2027 and 80,000 in 2030 to scale through the company’s technology in semiconductor-based fabrication and photonic interconnects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company would be executing on backlog, Oxford Ionics integration, and early quantum networking revenue related to ID Quantique and Capella in Q3. Marginal expansion would continue due to increased investments in R&amp;D, yet IonQ has enough capital to make these investments without dilution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1900\" data-height=\"1054\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"2025 Analyst Day\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408606249769_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>2025 Analyst Day</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In essence, IonQ is implementing an aggressive roadmap but in a position of strength in terms of finances. The company ended Q2 2025 with $656.8 million in cash, which <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/331/114331/original.pdf\">increased to $1.68 billion</a> after it received an equity investment of $1 billion from Susquehanna, which was priced at a 25% premium to the last close. The deal is the single biggest in the quantum industry, leaving IonQ debt-free and well-funded to 2030.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating expenses increased to $181 million in Q2, reflecting IonQ’s growth in R&amp;D investments and the integration of new subsidiaries. The company posted an adjusted EBITDA loss of $36.5 million, primarily due to a 231% increase in year-over-year spending on Research &amp; Development. The CFO left little doubt about his spending preferences with <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4822690-ionq-inc-ionq-analyst-investor-day-transcript\">$1.7 billion to spend</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While it has significant losses in the near term, IonQ's model emphasizes capability compounding rather than spending management. The growing list of hybrid contracts and primitive production solutions portends well for IonQ to turn adjusted EBITDA positive in the current decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1888\" data-height=\"1040\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"2025 Analyst Day\" width=\"640\" height=\"353\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618408605712087_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>2025 Analyst Day</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apps Shift from Research to Revenue</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One question investors always ask is when quantum computing becomes relevant to businesses. That question is being answered by IonQ.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The collaborative effort with AstraZeneca, Nvidia, and AWS has resulted in a<a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/331/114331/original.pdf\"> 20x speedup in drug discovery simulations</a>, thus establishing the real-world benefit. The other projects with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, General Dynamics, and Ansys seek to apply IonQ solutions to optimization problems in logistics and the efficiency of the energy grid, thereby establishing the real-world revenue from hybrid solutions today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The software stack at IonQ has transformed itself into a vital barrier to competition. What began with simple control of qubits has expanded to include an in-house OS, job scheduler, and chemistry/AI-specific repositories on top of it. The manner in which companies start with hybrid workloads and scale to full quantum has locked in revenue streams with strong SaaS-like characteristics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1892\" data-height=\"1052\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"2025 Analyst Day\" width=\"640\" height=\"356\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61094969-17618413778020518_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>2025 Analyst Day</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation: The Quantum Premium</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At around $61 per share, IONQ commands an enterprise value of roughly $20.7 billion, translating to a forward EV/Sales multiple of 226.9x and a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/comparison/new/MCUyQ2lvbnElMkNyZ3RpJTJDcWJ0cyUyQ3F1YnQ=\">Price/Sales ratio of 266x</a>, both far exceeding the sector median of around 3.6x. While traditional valuation ratios like P/E or EV/EBITDA remain meaningless in the quantum space, the premium highlights IonQ’s scarcity value and leadership position.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Compared to peers such as Rigetti (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RGTI\" title=\"Rigetti Computing, Inc.\">RGTI</a>) (EV/Sales 1,519x) and D-Wave (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QBTS\" title=\"D-Wave Quantum Inc.\">QBTS</a>) (445x), IonQ’s valuation, though steep, appears relatively moderate given its superior growth, institutional backing, and full-stack quantum integration spanning computing, networking, and space-based systems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_eb7dd7a559a89a7768b30dd24f4b6bfd.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_eb7dd7a559a89a7768b30dd24f4b6bfd.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_eb7dd7a559a89a7768b30dd24f4b6bfd.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_eb7dd7a559a89a7768b30dd24f4b6bfd.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_eb7dd7a559a89a7768b30dd24f4b6bfd.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_eb7dd7a559a89a7768b30dd24f4b6bfd.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_eb7dd7a559a89a7768b30dd24f4b6bfd.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_eb7dd7a559a89a7768b30dd24f4b6bfd.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_eb7dd7a559a89a7768b30dd24f4b6bfd.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Commercialization Timing Remains the Critical Variable</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most significant risk to IonQ, however, is the delay in commercialization. IonQ can potentially offer fault-tolerant technology before 2030, but monetizing it would require validating sustained consumer demand and scalability beyond piloting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IonQ has planned very aggressively, with goals for tens of millions of qubits and establishing quantum networks worldwide, and while integrating Oxford Ionics and Lightsynq seamlessly would allow it to expedite milestones, any delay in it can potentially reschedule them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">High R&amp;D investments with negative operating cash flow can potentially dilute the equity if it spends more on R&amp;D with less expected revenue in the initial phase, even with the current cash reserve of $1.6 billion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current financial situation of IonQ is one of heavy investment and not of weakness. Its unique IP, sovereign relationships, and plan to deliver large-scale quantum solutions mean that IonQ is on the verge of transitioning from being a speculative innovation play to being a full-fledged platform play, where any kind of valuation multiple becomes absolutely irrelevant to the situation.</p>",
