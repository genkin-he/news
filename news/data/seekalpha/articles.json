This is also true for DRD's US shares trading on the NYSE.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We will see how DRD intends to continue its success, based on the company's past performance and forecasts derived from the current business situation together with the macroeconomic and geopolitical situation. We present our readers with an updated overview.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Volatility Makes It Possible: The “Buy the Dips” Strategy</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This scenario, however, is not without its problems stemming from a weaker US dollar, which reflects macroeconomic difficulties in the US. Tariff uncertainty is resurfacing, as <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-tariff-uncertainty-trade-is-back-110011487.html?.tsrc=372&amp;ncid=crm_-1992266-20260224-1--A&amp;bt_user_id=eTtO+U5TsRu6u8OO1z2CTwiipBrdZfbii7skWcs8PY/piTanP9Dctgs8w8zbNBILYoxYszxd/248QxP4dRy6bdkI+MDwsewPEts7KqSb5yZrs5FA+0OtQezOGTOxbCBx&amp;bt_ts=1771931050136\" rel=\"nofollow\">new tariffs</a> from the Trump era are triggering fresh market concerns. Finally, <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-are-concerned-scott-bessent-says-treasury-is-keeping-a-close-eye-on-the-private-credit-market-145117264.html?.tsrc=372&amp;ncid=crm_-1992266-20260224-1--A&amp;bt_user_id=eTtO+U5TsRu6u8OO1z2CTwiipBrdZfbii7skWcs8PY/piTanP9Dctgs8w8zbNBILYoxYszxd/248QxP4dRy6bdkI+MDwsewPEts7KqSb5yZrs5FA+0OtQezOGTOxbCBx&amp;bt_ts=1771931050136\" rel=\"nofollow\">private credit risk</a> is rising, causing concerns about the $1.8 trillion market. We believe it is possible that this could lead to broader financial pressure, particularly for banks with non-performing loans, possibly similar to the SVB crisis in spring 2023. Our readers have likely already noticed that we are not excluding the possibility that the US financial system could be generally exposed to crisis risk. This is another indicator, which should ultimately benefit gold as a hedge against uncertainty. While rising gold prices underscore the profitability of DRD's South African operations, the weaker US dollar against the South African rand presents a challenge. Operating costs appear higher when converted to US dollars than they did during periods of a stronger US dollar. Although this is only an optical effect, as operating costs in South Africa are covered in local currency, it could nevertheless diminish the attractiveness of the stock as an investment. As a result, market participants with the power to influence valuations may become overly concerned about short-term effects, leading to a fear-driven decline in DRD's share price. This could be seen as yet another opportunity to strengthen their positions in DRD shares for those confident in DRD’s current performance and future gold prospects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, buying on the dip can provide resilience to the negative impact of concerns about the weak US dollar on the markets. This headwind will whisper through for a while, occasionally chilling the mood around DRD shares on the NYSE.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Statistics That Support Our View</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We substantiate the necessity of the strategy with statistical data on the performance of the DRD on the NYSE, as well as on the benchmarks of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GDX\" title=\"VanEck Gold Miners ETF\">GDX</a>), the Gold Spot Price (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAUUSD:CUR\" title=\"Gold Spot Price\">XAUUSD:CUR</a>), and the US$/ZAR exchange rate (US Dollar/South African Rand)—each based on the last twelve months (LTM) and year-to-date (YTD).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance of the securities in the respective markets (LTM):</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD +228.92% / 250 = 0.92% per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">GDX +172.16% / 250 = 0.69% per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">XAUUS$ +74.25% / 250 = 0.30% per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">US$ZAR -13.13% / 250 = 0.05% per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance of securities in the respective markets (YTD):</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD +22.13% / 35 = 0.63% per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">GDX +29.13% / 35 = 0.83% per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">XAUUS$ +18.74% / 35 = 0.54% per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">US$ZAR -3.31% / 35 = 0.09% per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: While the gold price is gaining momentum (with a daily increase of +0.30% year-to-date compared to +0.54% over the past twelve months), DRD is also growing, but less strongly in this initial start to 2026. The sector to which DRD belongs, and whose performance is tracked by the GDX ETF, generally follows the strengthening upward trend for the precious metal. DRD may have suffered from the increasing weakness in the US dollar, with the US$/ZAR exchange ratio deteriorating from a daily decline of 0.05% year-to-date to a daily decline of 0.09% over the past twelve months.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>From Our Previous Coverage</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In our previous article, we upgraded DRD to \"Buy\" due to its strong performance and promising future potential, fueled by the precious metals market recovery. DRD's earnings growth continued with dynamic expansion and improved margins, further strengthening its already solid balance sheet. These factors formed the basis for DRD's expansion plans at its ambitious core projects, Far West Gold Recoveries and the Ergo mines in South Africa. Although operating costs were not among the lowest in the South African gold production sector, the company's debt-free status offered potential for increased cash flow, aside from higher operating costs. DRD's well-positioned dividend contributed to shareholder value and reinforced the \"Buy\" signal despite share price volatility.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile: What Happened On Yield Front</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DRD/dividends/history\">raised</a> its regular semi-annual dividend to up to $0.3122 per share. The dividend was announced on February 20, 2026, and is scheduled to be paid on March 23, 2026. This is an increase from the $0.23 per share dividend announced on August 22, 2025, and paid on September 22, 2025—approximately one month earlier than the publication of our previous analysis of DRD stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The dividend boosted the share price, with DRD stock rising 48.54%, outpacing the S&amp;P 500's +0.43% change since our last article. Returns are as of the date of this writing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Interim Results After 6 Months: DRDGOLD's Situation As Of December 31, 2025</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial results were robust, primarily because the company, as it <a href=\"https://www.drdgold.com/media-insights/media-releases/2026/1834-drdgold-converts-favourable-gold-price-into-cash-generation-and-long-term-reinvestment\" rel=\"nofollow\">states</a> in the title, is able to</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>converts favourable gold price into cash generation and long-term reinvestment</p></blockquote> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Financials</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD faced several challenges beyond their control, but these could not jeopardize profitability, as the record-high gold price proved to be a formidable opponent to fight against and defeat. The precious metal was truly gargantuan in its hunger for constant new heights.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It should be noted that the average gold price achieved by DRD for the precious metal sold in the first half of the year, ending December 31, 2025 (First Half of Fiscal Year 2026), was approximately ZAR 2,114,227/kg (or US$3,555 per ounce), representing a 43% increase compared to the previous year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD is an unhedged producer and benefits fully from the higher gold price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD therefore reported the following changes in the growth of the most important profitability indicators for the six-month period ending December 30, 2025, or the first half of Fiscal Year 2026, compared to the previous year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Converted Financial Figures Using Seeking Alpha's US$/ZAR Exchange Rate:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue: UP 33% to ZAR 5,053.2 million, or ≈ US$ 298.9 million</li> <li>Headline Earnings: UP 99% to ZAR 1,932.4 million or ≈ US$ 114.4 million</li> <li>Operating Profit: UP 72% to ZAR 2,712.8 million or ≈ US$ 160.4 million</li> <li>Free Cash Inflow: UP 149% to ZAR 793.1 million or ≈ US$ 46.9 million</li> <li>Capital reinvestment in extending the operating life: UP 74% to ZAR 1,651.3 million, or ≈ US$ 97.6 million</li> <li>Cash and Cash Equivalents: UP 162% to ZAR 1,734.4 million or ≈ US$ 102.7 million</li> <li>Cash Operating Costs: UP 13% to ZAR 980,042 per kg or ≈ US$ 57,946.49 per kg</li> <li>All-in Sustaining Costs: UP 14% to ZAR 1,094,188 per kg or ≈ US$ 64,669.72 per kg</li> <li>Interim Cash Dividend of 50 cents per share: UP from 30 cents per share in H1 FY2025.</li> </ul> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Operations</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Group's gold production decreased by 9% to 2,337 kg. However, this decline is not a cause for concern, as we expect the rising gold price to enable economically viable extraction of the metal from the surface tailings piles with the lowest gold concentration (recovery of 0.188 g/t in H1 FY2026 compared to 0.199 g/t in H1 FY2025). Throughput decreased by 4% to 12.5 million tonnes in H1 FY2026 (compared to 12.9 million tonnes in H1 FY2025). With regard to the decrease in throughput, the company is not liable for any disruptions or impairments to operational efficiency, as these were attributable to rain and weather-related interruptions in November and December 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lower production due to factors beyond DRD's control temporarily led to higher costs. This was due to higher input costs, as these were spread over a smaller quantity of gold. Additionally, the currently higher gold price is resulting in higher royalties for gold mining and exploration companies worldwide. These cost changes are illustrated in the preceding “Financials” subsection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the increased costs resulting from lower production for reasons beyond DRD's control, the record gold price was the decisive factor driving DRD's improved profitability: the operating margin improved to 53.7% in H1 FY 2026, compared to 41.5% in H1 FY 2025—a gain of 1,220 basis points driven by an impressive YOY jump in gold revenues.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Outlook: Expansion In Sight</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The impressive profit margin enables DRDGOLD to advance its Vision 2028 with production increases and extended operating life beyond 2040. This will be obtainable as Ergo will optimize gold recovery and reduce costs by connecting to the Daggafontein tailings facility (TSF) and resuming tailings disposal at Withok. FWGR, receiving 80% of reinvestments, will expand the DP2 facility and build a regional tailings site, set to be operational by Q1 FY 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In its press releases regarding the interim results for the first half of fiscal year 2025, DRDGOLD also states:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The Group’s resource base increased following the transfer of approximately 67 million tonnes of goldbearing tailings from Sibanye-Stillwater to FWGR at the Kloof 2 dump.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These resources from Sibanye will be added to the following resources:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392746994665_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1317\" data-height=\"670\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"> <picture> </picture></a></span><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392746994665_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1317\" data-height=\"670\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392746994665_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: DRDGOLD Limited website\" width=\"640\" height=\"326\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392746994665_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392746994665_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392746994665_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392746994665_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

The 52-week range was from $10.73 to $39.37. Due to volatility, the 20-day moving average is currently above the 50-day moving average, which in turn is above the 100-day moving average, and this is finally above the 200-day moving average. This indicates a positive market trend in the short, medium, and long term. From here, there is still considerable upside potential, as the RSI of 58.32 paves the way for robust price growth until the overbought level of approximately 80 is reached. This will initiate the next upward phase, provided the gold price continues to rise. Also, the two short-term lines are very close together, as the cycle is currently volatile. The 20-day moving average is converging on the 50-day simple moving average, and a lower share price is possible soon. However, should this present an attractive entry point, it remains to be seen, given the current gold price of $5,194.15, which is putting amazing bullish pressure on everything.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Valuation</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The data at <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DRD/valuation/metrics\">Seeking Alpha</a> has provided the following financial figures, available as of this writing:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD's P/E Non-GAAP (FWD) of 16.76 Vs. Sector Median's 17.09.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD's P/E GAAP (TTM) of 16.63 Vs. Sector Median's 24.70.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD's EV/EBITDA (TTM) of 11.45 Vs. Sector Median's 12.08.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD's EV/EBITDA (FWD) of 9.39 Vs. Sector Median's 9.43.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD's Price/Cash Flow (TTM) of 11.72 Vs. Sector Median's 13.16.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DRD's Dividend Yield (TTM) of 1.46% Vs. Sector Median's 1.58%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In our view, the comparison suggests that DRD stock is valued in line with the sector median, possibly even slightly below. This would allow investors to profit from the record price of the precious metal with DRD shares—at a more favorable valuation than most competitors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The buy signal is supported by the comparison, while concerns about the costs in USD due to the weak US currency, which has been mentioned at the beginning of this analysis, may provide a valid reason to hope for the implementation of a “buy the dip” strategy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Risks</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are the risk factors:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance Sheet Risk: The first six months of the 2026 fiscal year showed that with 14% higher AISC due to a 9% lower group gold production to 2,337 kg, it is possible to achieve a 1,220 basis point gain in the margin to 53.7%, driven by an impressive escalation in gold revenues due to a 43% jump in the gold price of 2,114,227 ZAR/kg (or 3,555 USD per ounce). As costs will be lower as their increase was due to temporary factors, beyond which production can reasonably be expected to be at least in line with H1 2026, analysts' forecasts for a gold price of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4551711-gold-pullback-seen-as-buying-opportunity-anz-forecasts-5800oz-in-q2-2026\">$5,800</a> per troy ounce to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4546215-deutsche-bank-stands-firm-on-6000-gold-target-as-it-says-the-bullish-case-remains-intact\">$6,000/oz</a> reflect a 69% upside over the average realized by DRD in H1 2026. This puts the margin on track to sustain improved earnings, dividend payments, and capital expenditures, with the possibility that some expansion projects, such as FWGR's DP2 facility plus regional tailings facilities, will be operational well before Q1 2027. This will boost the share price if things move in line with past trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold Bearish Risk: The biggest risk, therefore, lies in the price of gold, which has so far benefited from strong demand for gold as a hedge against global turmoil. This risk would be particularly reduced if the war in Ukraine were to end, as this war is a major pillar of international tension and disputes between the Western bloc and countries allied with Russia. With the end of the war, the market's incentive to buy gold for its portfolios would disappear. The first to feel the effects of a stagnant or even falling gold price would be DRD's profits, the company's growth prospects given the imminent completion of projects, and consequently the company's shares on the NYSE.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, CEO Niël Pretorius said in his commentary on DRDGOLD's interim results for the first half of the 2025 financial year:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Favourable gold prices have allowed us to reinvest meaningfully in extending the life of our operations, to maintain a strong financial position and to continue to create value in a way that remains sustainable for our business and our stakeholders,</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Low Volume of Tradable Shares: According to Seeking Alpha's “<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DRD\">Trading Data</a>” section, only 384,958 shares of DRDGOLD Limited were traded in the last three months, indicating low trading volume on a daily basis. This dynamic introduces a two-sided liquidity risk (bearish/bullish): if a bearish trend necessitates a rapid liquidation of positions, the lack of trading volume forces sellers to accept considerably lower prices, often resulting in important capital erosion. However, this structural illiquidity also acts as a flywheel for higher multiples; if there is an increase in buyer demand, the limited supply of available shares can trigger an aggressive and disproportionate improvement in the asset's market valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Country Risk: The Sprott Mining Risk Heat Map assigns South Africa an orange code, indicating high risk for DRD's reprocessing of gold tailings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392782217088_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1128\" data-height=\"730\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392782217088_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Sprott Asset Management\" width=\"640\" height=\"414\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392782217088_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392782217088_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392782217088_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/5074741-17720392782217088_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Sprott Asset Management</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the NYSE shares of DRDGOLD Limited, a Johannesburg-based gold company that extracts the yellow metal from the processing of surface mine waste in South Africa, we reiterate our Buy signal. As the company's profitability will benefit from the record high gold price, progress on expansion programs, and climbing shareholder value, this will strengthen market sentiment, potentially resulting in an upward share price.</p>",

(3:26)</p> <p>This is an abridged transcript of the podcast:</p> <p>Our top story so far, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557783-from-ai-to-a1-sauce-staples-are-now-pricier-than-megacaps\">investors are going from AI to A1.</a></p> <p>Looking at forward valuations, the premium investors were paying for the mega caps has faded — and they’re now willing to pay up for household goods and pantry fillers.</p> <p>Neil Sethi of Sethi Advisors flagged a chart from Matt Cerminaro showing that the average forward P/E of the Magnificent 7 excluding Tesla — Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), Alphabet (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a></span>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>), Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), Microsoft (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a></span>) and Nvidia (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a></span>) — is now below the Consumer Staples (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLP\" title=\"State Street Cons Staples Sel Sec SPDR Inc ETF\">XLP</a></span>) sector.</p> <p>And today’s hardware-led selloff — with Nvidia sliding while staples hold steady — is only reinforcing that shift.</p> <p>Sethi noted that staples’ forward P/E has climbed to its highest level in at least a decade, while the top six megacaps have fallen toward the low end of their range over the same period.</p> <p>He added that a big driver is the Walmart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>) and Costco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COST\" title=\"Costco Wholesale Corporation\">COST</a>) effect — together about 20% of XLP and trading at P/Es in the 40 to 50 range — but he argues the broader staples group still looks stretched, and it’s hard to see most of those names suddenly turning into big earnings compounders.</p> <p>Among active stocks, two guilty-pleasure names are off to the races.</p> <p>Krispy Kreme (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DNUT\" title=\"Krispy Kreme, Inc.\">DNUT</a>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557668-krispy-kreme-rallies-as-turnaround-efforts-start-to-pay-off\">is up more than 20% as investors reward its turnaround strategy.</a> Revenue fell 2.9% year over year in Q4, with organic revenue down 3.9%, largely due to the strategic closure of underperforming locations — a move that reduced global points of access by 13.5%.</p> <p>CEO Josh Charlesworth said the company is making meaningful progress, pointing to strong demand, profitable U.S. expansion, and capital-light international franchise growth.</p> <p>And Shake Shack (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHAK\" title=\"Shake Shack Inc.\">SHAK</a>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557800-shake-shack-absorbs-higher-beef-prices-with-promos-onion-rings-and-the-dubai-chocolate-shake\">is rallying after posting a double-digit sales jump in Q4</a>, helped by promotions and new menu items — allowing it to offset higher beef costs and a challenging macro environment.</p> <p>Looking ahead to 2026, Shake Shack expects pressure from beef prices to ease as supply-chain initiatives kick in and cost pressures on food and paper products moderate.</p> <p>And speaking of races, Churchill Downs (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CHDN\" title=\"Churchill Downs Incorporated\">CHDN</a>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557122-churchill-downs-gets-a-boost-from-both-historical-racing-and-live-sports-betting\">is trailing the field</a>, despite posting higher Q4 revenue in both its live and historical racing business and its wagering services and solutions segment. Gaming revenue did fall from a year ago and analysts pointed to expanded risks.</p> <p>In other news of note, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557445-washington-post-losses-2025\">the Wall Street Journal reports The Washington Post lost about $100M last year</a>, following similar losses in 2024 and roughly $77M in 2023.</p> <p>The financial strain was a primary driver behind recent layoffs of about one-third of the workforce — cuts that eliminated the sports section and scaled back many foreign bureaus.</p> <p>At a staff meeting Wednesday, acting publisher and CEO Jeff D’Onofrio and executive editor Matt Murray discussed the paper’s financial condition and productivity.</p> <p>D’Onofrio said the number of news stories published has fallen 42% since 2020, while newsroom costs were up 16% in 2025 compared with 2020.</p> <p>Looking to ETFs, <a href=\"https://%20https//seekingalpha.com/news/4557786-jane-street-becomes-slvs-top-holder-in-q4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jane Street disclosed a record 20.7M-share stake in the iShares Silver Trust</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLV\" title=\"iShares Silver Trust ETF\">SLV</a>) for Q4 2025, making it the ETF’s largest institutional holder.</p> <p>The stake surged from about 41K shares in Q3, vaulting Jane Street ahead of big holders like BlackRock (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BLK\" title=\"BlackRock, Inc.\">BLK</a>), Morgan Stanley (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MS\" title=\"Morgan Stanley\">MS</a>) and Bank of America (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC\" title=\"Bank of America Corporation\">BAC</a>).</p> <p>The filing also shows SLV put and call options, suggesting the position may be part of a hedged setup rather than a straight directional bet on silver.</p> <p>And in the Wall Street Research Corner, the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" class=\"ticker-link\">SP500</a>)<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557551-sp-500-flashes-sixth-hindenburg-omen-in-a-month\"> has triggered its sixth Hindenburg Omen signal in the past month</a>, according to data compiled by Subu Trade — reviving memories of February 2020, when a cluster of similar signals came ahead of the COVID-driven selloff.</p> <p>The Hindenburg Omen is a technical indicator meant to flag internal weakness in the market. It’s triggered when a meaningful number of NYSE stocks hit new 52-week highs and new 52-week lows at the same time — a split that suggests market breadth is fracturing.</p> <p>Other conditions often include a rising index and a weakening McClellan Oscillator, a momentum gauge.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder\"></div><p>Historically, it’s the clusters of signals — not isolated readings — that get traders’ attention. But it’s also worth noting: over the past decade, it’s been a false alarm more often than not.</p>",

Like silver and gold, copper prices have stumbled a bit in recent weeks, although<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the pullback wasn’t nearly so dramatic. Copper prices are driven more by demand and applicable use rather than as a store of wealth, like gold (and to a lesser extent, silver). Copper is heavily used in data centers, and the massive global data center expansion has helped send copper prices soaring. However, I believe we’ll see the data center build-out ease a bit, and even if momentum is maintained, fiber optics may cool demand for copper.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Copper inventories in the United States surged ahead of tariffs as well, raising the prospect of a glut. While I’m going to cover the ETF in specific, I believe its price is primarily going to be driven by the price of copper. Historically, the two track each other pretty consistently. Ultimately, I don’t believe the above trends are going to completely upend the copper market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720256656873538_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1218\" data-height=\"630\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720256656873538_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"copper stocks globally\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720256656873538_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720256656873538_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720256656873538_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720256656873538_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Mining.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A massive, sustained plunge in copper prices would be surprising, but I do believe tailwinds will cool, and shallow retreats should be expected. Inventories are high in the United States, China, and other key markets, but demand should remain high as well. Fiber optics could cool demand but won’t eliminate it. Still, I believe risks have ticked up while upside has cooled. As such, I’m downgrading my rating to a hold.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trade War Led To Soaring Copper Stockpiles</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the bruising trade war heated up, copper stockpiles soared. The Trump Administration ultimately leveled Section 232 tariffs on finished and semi-finished copper products but <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/31/why-us-copper-tariff-exemption-wont-fully-ease-price-rises.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">decided against</a> tariffing raw materials. That exemption <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/trump-just-crashed-the-copper-market-43ffff25\" rel=\"nofollow\">led to a sell-off</a>, but copper prices mostly trended up through 2025. On June 30th, 2026, the Administration is expected to announce whether additional copper tariffs should be applied to refined copper. Potential tariffs of 15% for 2027 and 30% for 2028 are on the table. Amid elevated inflation and with the 2026 midterms looming, I suspect the Administration will decide against tariffs for now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214019427326_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"502\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214019427326_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"copper inventories\" width=\"640\" height=\"201\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214019427326_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214019427326_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214019427326_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214019427326_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>CME Group</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CME warehouses, which store copper approved for exchanges, have seen <a href=\"https://www.mining.com/web/column-copper-is-pricing-scarcity-at-a-time-of-plenty/\" rel=\"nofollow\">inventories explode </a>from 85,000 tons at the beginning of 2025 to well north of half a million tons in recent weeks.

Many companies have come under fire for investing massive sums into developing AI. OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>) recently announced that it is <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/20/openai-resets-spend-expectations-targets-around-600-billion-by-2030.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">cutting its CapEx spending</a> plans in half. The company had envisioned spending $1.4 trillion on AI development by 2030 but now aims to spend “just” $600 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon.com, Inc.'s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) and Alphabet Inc.'s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) share prices have taken hits in recent weeks, following the unveiling of massive spending plans. Keep an eye on financial news media, and you’ll likely hear claims that the AI spending is unsustainable. Amid pressure and criticism, more companies may announce plans to slow spending. If this happens, it’ll almost surely include major cuts to infrastructure investments. This, in turn, could substantially reduce demand for copper.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As far as OpenAI, Anthropic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>), and Magnificent 7 companies are concerned, I expect AI spending to remain brisk. Even with OpenAI, I wouldn’t be surprised if they change course yet again in a few months or years. If and when investors get comfortable with AI, OpenAI could re-raise its spending targets. Then again, I also wouldn’t be surprised if some of the other big players announce plans to cut back on spending. This would mean fewer data centers and thus less copper consumed. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if we see smaller players scaling down AI infrastructure investments. Currently, the pursuit of AI is at risk of developing into a \"be big\" or go home endeavor.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Don’t Overlook Fiber</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Transferring data across copper requires quite a bit of energy and can quickly result in heating issues. While copper has played a vital role in the AI build-out, don’t be surprised if it’s replaced by a better technology. With copper, developers can be restrained by the wiring itself. Fiber-optic alternatives can transfer far more quickly and don’t produce as much heat. Given the simple economics of the situation, I expect <a href=\"https://www.eetimes.com/why-fiber-optics-is-replacing-copper-in-data-centers/\" rel=\"nofollow\">fiber-optic substitution</a> to unfold rather rapidly. This would reduce demand for copper but won’t eliminate it.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">COPX: Some Fundamentals and Valuation Considerations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since I covered COPX a few months ago and went over portfolio content and various fundamentals, I’m going to focus on what’s changed. First, the PE ratio has obviously climbed a bit. Back in October, it was a tantalizing 16.88 but has since ticked up to 18.05. That’s still pretty good in my eyes but is slightly above the category average of 17.74. The Price/Sales ratio rose from 0.97x to 1.56x, which is pretty significant but not something I’m worried about.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The dividend yield dropped from 1.29% to 0.82%. While the yield wasn’t particularly high beforehand, it has shrunk considerably. Share prices have risen steadily, as illustrated below. After such big climbs, it’s easy for would-be investors to wonder if they missed the boat. If judged by the generally good fundamentals, I’d disagree with that sentiment. However, the potential headwinds discussed above could overwhelm those fundamentals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_846f0e49ca9d79367c41a51d75d48b3a.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_846f0e49ca9d79367c41a51d75d48b3a.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_846f0e49ca9d79367c41a51d75d48b3a.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_846f0e49ca9d79367c41a51d75d48b3a.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, I rate COPX a hold. This is in pretty stark contrast to Seeking Alpha’s quant tools, which give a strong buy recommendation. My ratings are often only one level higher or lower than the quant tool grades. Two levels is rather rare, but that’s the case here. That said, my thesis primarily lies in the market and macro environment and headwinds that are hard to fully capture with quant tools. I don’t put as much weight into momentum as the other factors, and I’d argue the dividend grade is rather rich.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214018625793_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1254\" data-height=\"478\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214018625793_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"quant grades COPX\" width=\"640\" height=\"244\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214018625793_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214018625793_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214018625793_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9111751-17720214018625793_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why I Could Be Wrong</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this article, I focused on AI development and its impact on copper demand. However, copper is used in many other endeavors as well. Copper piping is common in households. Copper is also crucial for electric vehicle technologies. Demand outside of AI may push prices higher even if AI companies go on a diet. Further, other countries are entering the AI race and are building out data centers, which should bolster copper demand.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Takeaway: Solid Upside But Higher Risk</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">COPX has had a good run, but for now, I believe tailwinds will weaken a bit. As such, COPX is now a hold for me. Investors would be wise to keep an eye on emerging technologies and their potential to disrupt copper demand. The stockpiles could result in a glut, but I’d expect that to be short-lived.</p>",

This call was based on structural risk-reward asymmetry alone. PLTW, with a 120% Palantir (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR\" title=\"Palantir Technologies Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">PLTR</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) weekly return tracking methodology, is obviously a leveraged and suffers when Palantir Technologies, Inc. (PLTR) corrects. So, as expected, since August, PLTW has corrected significantly.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where PLTY disappoints is that during past drawdowns (like April 2025), it has hardly mitigated collapses to the same extent that it caps upsides. That is the risk asymmetry that had made PLTY a Hold in my view. As Palantir has corrected significantly over the past few months now, I have reviewed the PLTW vs. PLTY thesis to study whether the expected structural issues have persisted in PLTY in a slower and longer drawdown — and they have. On the contrary, PLTW has done what its structure predictably allows. The first sustained drawdown gives us critical insights into the structural differences and hence sets expectations ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, the structural hierarchy remains Buy PLTW and Hold PLTY because no structural fixes have emerged since in PLTY. A look at the PLTY structure now shows it is well-poised to capture gains if there is a rebound. However, a similar structure in the recent past was also attributed to a lack of meaningful drawdown mitigation. Actively managed option-based strategies have active agility potential in terms of strike selection, the extent of portfolio coverage, and even implementing different derivative strategies (like collars or spreads) — PLTY's performance and current positioning seem to indicate they maintain a light options layer, i.e., less income focus and keeping upside capture open. Despite that upside capture focus, it is obviously behind PLTW if PLTR rebounds.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Palantir is the Protagonist</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A look at the charts comparing total returns between PLTR, PLTY, and PLTW clearly shows the obvious - the primary decider of where PLTY and PLTW are headed is Palantir. There is no way around betting on the underlying thesis when riding both vehicles: PLTW is obvious by definition, and PLTY is because of its setup (as we will see in the subsequent section).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3a015a98018912cfa364eabb56c46ebc.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3a015a98018912cfa364eabb56c46ebc.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3a015a98018912cfa364eabb56c46ebc.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_3a015a98018912cfa364eabb56c46ebc.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In August, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793478-palantirs-retail-led-rally-might-have-structural-legs\">I had a bullish thesis</a> in Palantir. That <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4839687-palantir-great-quarter-greater-caution\">outlook changed</a> in November, and I have not changed my outlook since. The concerns that emerged in November were centered around extreme valuation expansion in a market that was looking less sure about underwriting long-duration growth assumptions. I also took a neutral stand because stock-based compensation appeared to be a high-risk dilution if shares corrected. Despite strong execution and growth, cash generation lagged operating leverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market regime has not changed since, and this time we have not yet seen a quick rebound like we saw in April 2025. I am yet to update my view on Palantir ahead, but I have a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872479-schgs-upgrade-engine-is-losing-steam-time-to-temper-expectations\">generic thesis</a> around growth markets and how they are poised for a period of consolidation ahead, as earnings grow into valuations and earnings upgrades start showing up only after a few quarters of digestion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PLTW clearly moves when Palantir moves next, either up or further down. PLTY too, despite an option layer, does not add too much alpha in consolidation. Most of its trajectory is a reflection of Palantir. So, there is little to choose between them in the upcoming expected phase of stagnation. The clearer positioning choice is for the next big move, whenever that happens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strictly speaking from a statistical perspective, the odds of an upward move increase after a stock is down ~30% (from August). Plus, the long-term thesis in Palantir is still intact (although timing is not). Another angle that preserves the PLTW Buy and a PLTY Hold at this point (apart from odds and Palantir outlook) is that the utility of an option-based strategy like PLTY is usually at the highs (like was the case in August) and less so now, after some meaningful corrections. I had explained this use case of options-based strategies at underlying highs for BTCI in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4864360-btcis-moment-is-over-why-this-bitcoin-income-star-just-lost-its-edge\">a separate </a>analysis; the same is applicable for PLTY and any other covered call play:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>BTCI is a psychologically easier vehicle to ride Bitcoin at the highs. Although the drawdown mitigation is not huge, when investors have a fear of heights after a Bitcoin rally, BTCI offers a less daunting entry - knowing fully well it will trace upsides reasonably well from there but offers consolation if there is a crash (material or not).</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So overall, PLTY and PLTW both work on Palantir's moves, and overwhelmingly so. Simply looking at the risk-reward asymmetry when Palantir rallies and the increasing odds after a correction, PLTW becomes an even stronger Buy today over PLTY than it was in August. Of course, if your Palantir thesis is weak, neither vehicle is appropriate.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">First Sustained Drawdown and What it Reveals</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apart from a change in the underlying strength (Palantir), one of the key reasons to revisit this thesis is to see whether my theoretical expectations of minimal drawdown protection in PLTY still holds in a slower drawdown, this being the first sustained drawdown since PLTY's inception. Unfortunately, it does.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I had mentioned how the speed of a drawdown matters in my earlier thesis, and this is how a longer drawn-out correction offers a chance for an option-based strategy to provide a greater (although limited) cushion. If I were to buy an ATM option for a March-end expiry today, the $130 strike <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR/options\">call option</a> is trading close to $8. That is ~6% premiums relative to the spot prices. In other words, a fully covered portfolio through ATM call writing should limit drawdowns in the underlying by 6% — the premiums earned on written calls. The exact extent of protection is limited and defined by the number of options written.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Income strategies often balance aggressive income versus keeping upside capture open (through a lighter option layer and written at further strikes). But whatever the level of aggressiveness, unless the option layer is extremely small, you expect a material mitigation from this setup every month. And since the mitigation is limited, a prolonged slump over several months adds up premiums earned compared to a sharp drop (like April 2025) and rebound scenario. Since August, Palantir has been broadly flat and has been correcting since the end of last year (more than a month). Across the entire period, the option premiums earned should have added up. However, the returns data show only a ~3% mitigation in this period in the PLTY route. In what has been a first regime of \"flat followed by corrections\" period for Palantir spanning months, the strategy has disappointed even my own theoretical expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This can be explained by PLTY's exact setup. And once that is understood, expectations ahead also become clearer. I downloaded the current holdings (as of February 25, 2026) and saw synthetic positions (implemented as short puts and long calls at strikes of $140 and $150) for March and April expiries. The total exposure adds up to ~$372 million. The option layer is implemented as a staggered ladder of call spreads (long far away strike and short the nearer strike). There are three such setups with the strikes for the spread only $5 apart. The total notional value of this layer adds up to ~$325 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62089123-17720054533708062_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"864\" data-height=\"224\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62089123-17720054533708062_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PLTY Current Portfolio - Feb 25th 2026\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"166\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62089123-17720054533708062_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62089123-17720054533708062_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62089123-17720054533708062_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62089123-17720054533708062_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">PLTY Current Portfolio - Feb 25th 2026 <span>(PLTY Holdings (Website))</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A couple of observations can be made from this setup that explains both the lack of drawdown mitigation and its relatively better position in capturing upsides. A spread setup means all the income from the short call position is not retained — a significant chunk is used to fund the long position in the further strike call that retains upside capture. The net income is poor from the setup and explains why it should not be expected to add alpha in drawdowns and flat conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The long call leg of the covered call spread implies sharper rallies are relatively well captured; there are blind spots such as the spot ending up between the strikes and efficiency losses from net premium costs while capturing such a rally. So, the expectation from PLTY is one where drawdowns are mitigated but not materially; nothing meaningful is added in consolidating markets, and rebounds from here can be captured well but will still lag due to inefficiencies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, PLTW captures any rebound within any timeframe (from a sharp rebound to a slow grind up) and adds the ~20% leverage on top of the efficient upside capture. The current drawdown also reveals how PLTW has its own shortcomings too. PLTW uses total return swaps that provide linear exposure to the underlying returns. This is leveraged roughly to around 120%, but there is no option convexity loss that explains the more than 20% magnification of the ~31% drawdown in PLTR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Simple math implies that a 120% leveraged vehicle should be only down by 37-37.5%, but PLTW has another 2-2.5% extra drag to account for. This mechanism is implied in the weekly reset structure, where there could be permanent volatility drag and losses irrespective of the eventual direction of the underlying stock. Usually volatility is seen more during drawdowns, but it could be applicable in rallies too if that remains volatile. So, while PLTW offers mechanical leverage minus an option layer that could add alpha, it does have a permanent volatility drag. This can range anywhere around the 2-2.5% drag we saw in the past months, meaning a longer wait time before a rebound can mean some losses that will not be recovered even if PLTR finally rebounds.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Pecking Order is Retained</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The final takeaways of this thesis, updated for the slower and more sustained drawdown scenario, are the following. I will enumerate only the ones that have become more visible over the past five months. One, Palantir is the main protagonist. If investors do not have a bullish underlying thesis on Palantir in the long run, then neither instrument is recommended. Two, for those who still have a long-term bullish thesis, the pecking order remains PLTW (Buy) over PLTY (Hold). This is because the odds of a rebound appear stronger now, and PLTY's utility as an entry vehicle at the highs is diminished after a fall.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Three, PLTW does have a cost of waiting. However, while PLTY theoretically has the advantage of being able to add premium income if Palantir consolidates for a long while, its setup is geared to capture upside over generating income. So, unless the wait is prolonged (over a year), PLTW's waiting premium (due to volatility losses) still does not compensate enough for the gains when Palantir rebounds. In fact, PLTY's performance in a slower drawdown period has shown how it is structurally set up for gains over income — the very game that PLTW should excel in.</p>",

However, I was bullish because its Falcon product was not to blame, and also due to the trust factor, arguing that customers were unlikely to switch to the competition just because of one glitch in the company’s long track record.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For this thesis, I employ the same trust argument, this time to alleviate AI disruption fears, implying it warrants a rerating. For this purpose, looking through the lenses of relationship psychology, I first use Rusbult’s \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_model_of_commitment\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Investment Model of Commitment</a>\" to show that investors are likely to remain committed to the cybersecurity provider after Anthropic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>) recently unveiled a new AI feature called Claude Code Security.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Relationship Psychology Shows Customers Are Likely to Remain Committed to CrowdStrike</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a social psychologist, Caryl Rusbult conceived her commitment model to explain why people stay in relationships for years, even when it appears to others (the family or society) that it is not worth staying together. In this particular context, “investment” means the time and effort (including financial) that each person has committed to their relationship.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Making a parallel with cybersecurity, corporations that choose CrowdStrike not only invest capital to purchase its endpoint security but also train their support teams (engineers and technicians) on the associated products, highlighting a partnership relationship rather than a buyer-seller approach.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to investment, Rusbult also emphasizes satisfaction (how good the relationship feels) and alternatives (like the implications of getting separated). In other words, if someone has made a big investment in a relationship and is satisfied while not having valid alternatives, she will continue to be committed (to her partner), even if there are intermittent problems (quarrels).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the same way, even when the glitch impacted 8.5 million devices due to a malfunction in CrowdStrike's security updates in 2024, the company continues to remain <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\">trusted</a>, as shown below, because customers obtain satisfaction from its Falcon platform to safeguard their data and comply with the strictest regulations, especially when facing AI-driven <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">cyberattacks</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720005541649184_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1463\" data-height=\"645\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720005541649184_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"s\" width=\"640\" height=\"282\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720005541649184_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720005541649184_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720005541649184_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720005541649184_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>www.crowdstrike.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In consequence, CrowdStrike did not face an erosion of its customer base, but, on the contrary, its total sales progressed from <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD/income-statement\">$3.05 billion</a> in fiscal year 2024 (FY-24 ending in January 2024) to $3.95 billion in FY 2025. Also, revenues of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD/earnings/estimates\">$4.80 billion</a> are expected for FY-26, which would represent a 21.5% YoY increase if achieved.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Instead of Being Disrupted, CrowdStrike Has Rapidly Integrated GenAI</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using the same logic, that is, a trust relationship is not easily broken, even if a new competitor comes up with a much cheaper endpoint protection tool as a result of employing AI agents (virtual software entities that work on behalf of a human developer) instead of human developers, it is unlikely for enterprises with critical data valued at billions of dollars to entrust them with their IT security needs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is especially so since, to reduce the chances of it being disrupted, CrowdStrike has rapidly integrated Gen AI in its product line, namely with <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/charlotte-ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charlotte AI,</a> as shown below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/49663886-17717389438881798_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"709\" data-height=\"358\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/49663886-17717389438881798_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"s\" width=\"640\" height=\"323\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/49663886-17717389438881798_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/49663886-17717389438881798_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/49663886-17717389438881798_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/49663886-17717389438881798_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>www.crowdstrike.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The approach here consists of assisting users, such as security analysts working in SOCs (Security Operations Centers), in identifying potential threats before they translate into issues. For investors, large enterprises rely on these centers, which are manned by security analysts on a 24/7 basis and which act as the first line of defense against viruses and cyberattacks. The problem is that this includes tedious and resource-intensive tasks that consume significant man-hours, given the sheer number of alerts. To address this issue, CrowdStrike automates or partially automates (depending on the corporate goals) through AI agents deployed through the Falcon <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Agentic</a> Security Platform, an augmented version of its Falcon product.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The aim is to make the SOCs more autonomous, an approach essential to avoid staff manning them drowning in alerts as these rise <a href=\"https://www.vikingcloud.com/blog/cybersecurity-statistics#:~:text=The%20Outlook%20on%20Cyberattacks%20is,%E2%80%A2\" rel=\"nofollow\">exponentially</a>. Moreover, with the Charlotte AI platform, another innovation consists of the alert database being queried in natural language (plain English) instead of complex jargon understandable only by highly trained professionals. With such an approach, junior analysts can do the job, thus economizing support dollars for CrowdStrike's customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, against the daunting backdrop consisting of the <a href=\"https://onlineprograms.ecu.edu/blog/ai-cyber-attacks/#:~:text=The%20advancement%20and%20increasing%20accessibility,2023%2C%20according%20to%20a%20report\" rel=\"nofollow\">astronomical</a> rise of AI-driven attacks, whereas the hacker enhances his capabilities using AI agents, CrowdStrike has not stayed idle. It has rapidly embedded innovation in its cybersecurity portfolio. However, in sharp contrast, the stock has suffered and lost around <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD\">8%</a> on February 20 after the Anthropic announcement, hinting that investors are overlooking how the cybersecurity provider has augmented its products using AI and the trust factor. This is why I believe the stock deserves better.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuing CrowdStrike Based on the Trust Factor and Competitive Positioning</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, to quantify \"human trust\" in a stock like CrowdStrike involves assessing how customer loyalty fared in the period following the major outage. Now, in addition to revenue growth mentioned earlier, its fiscal third quarter 2025 (which ended in October 2024) gross retention rate, or the percentage of recurring revenue retained from existing customers, of over <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740521-crowdstrike-holdings-inc-crwd-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">97%,</a> shows resiliency three months after the outage, due to customers sticking to Falcon. Also, net retention rate, which measures whether customers have purchased more from the company, was <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4740521-crowdstrike-holdings-inc-crwd-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">115%</a>, showing a strengthened commitment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next step is to assess how brand perception has evolved as AI has taken center stage over the last two years. In this case, its Net Promoter Score of <a href=\"https://www.comparably.com/brands/crowdstrike\" rel=\"nofollow\">42</a> (on a scale of -100 to 100) indicates that its reputation remains positive, with 63% promoters (satisfied users) and 21% detractors (dissatisfied users).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, loyalty and a strong brand both support product adoption and sales, but only if the technology has kept up amid the competition. In this connection, as shown <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\">below</a>, the company has been named a <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/blog/crowdstrike-leader-2025-idc-marketscape-exposure-management/#:~:text=AI%20agents%20and%20automated%20remediation,addresses%20risk%20in%20real%20time.\" rel=\"nofollow\">leader</a> in IDC MarketScape for Exposure Management in August 2025, ahead of Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), which has been categorized as a major player.

Thus, in view of the strength of its brand, ability to maintain customer loyalty, its competitive positioning, and its undervaluation (trading at a trailing P/S of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD/valuation/metrics\">21x</a>, which is around 23% below its five-year average), it appears to have been punished too hard.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, applying a premium of 23% to its current share price of $350, I have a target of $430 (350 x 1.23). This still represents a moderate position given its above 40% slide since November last year, but there are risks mainly related to AI startups.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <span>There Are Risks, But Paradoxically, AI Implies More Business for</span> <span>CrowdStrike</span> </h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What’s great about the recently launched Anthropic's security feature, Claude <a href=\"https://snyk.io/articles/anthropic-launches-claude-code-security/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Code</a> Security, is that it automatically scans code for security weaknesses, even suggesting fixes. Its launch on February 20 spelled havoc for cybersecurity stocks, with CrowdStrike sliding by around <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWD\">8%</a>, which is considerable. There could be other similar episodes triggered by AI-led innovation, given that cybersecurity startups have garnered more than<a href=\"https://softwarestrategiesblog.com/2025/10/28/top-ten-cybersecurity-startups-2025-investor-funding/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> $3 billion</a> in venture capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, in addition to AI bubble fears, which were amplified since November last year (introductory chart), the stock has also been volatile because of “SaaS is <a href=\"https://www.forrester.com/blogs/saas-as-we-know-it-is-dead-how-to-survive-the-saas-pocalypse/\" rel=\"nofollow\">dead</a>” fears. This centers around the emergence of new competitors (disruptors) offering cheaper products as a result of carrying out software development using AI agents instead of the human programmers employed by incumbents.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I believe these fears are largely unjustified for the following reasons.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, while Claude Security has potential, it is currently available in limited research preview mode, meaning for testing and refinement for production environments through a select group of users, not for general, unrestricted commercial use. Second, the fact that it can spot serious new vulnerabilities can also potentially be used by attackers to augment their attacks, something known as the <a href=\"https://www.trendingtopics.eu/anthropic-claude-code-security-flash-crash-stocks/\" rel=\"nofollow\">dual-use</a> aspect of technology, or be used for good or bad. One example is hackers using Anthropic AI to commit <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crr24eqnnq9o\" rel=\"nofollow\">theft.</a> Thus, organizations have to be very careful when using Claude Security.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the company is not immune to volatility related to the AI bubble bursting or a new startup developing a revolutionary IT protection solution, I believe that paradoxically, its business could benefit from AI, potentially amplifying the number of cyberattacks. In this connection, when talking about AI agents during the most recent earnings call, CrowdStrike's CEO emphasized their \"rapidly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4527899-crowdstrike-outlines-23-percent-arr-growth-target-for-fy26-as-ai-driven-demand-accelerates\">expanding</a> risk profile\" and how these represented a \"major driver for the business\". This implies more sales and supports the bullish position, as cybersecurity annual spending is expected to exceed <a href=\"https://cybersecurityventures.com/official-2026-cybersecurity-market-report-predictions-and-statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">$500 billion</a> as of this year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the Age of AI Agents, Human-Based Trust and CrowdStrike Integrated Platform Are Essential</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In conclusion, this thesis has shown the importance of human-based trust, a key element that, according to me, is being overlooked as investors' focus on AI’s prowess during product demos, not what they are actually capable of in a corporate setup. In the same vein, AI startups cannot replicate CrowdStrike's highly integrated Falcon platform, which combines endpoint, identity protection, data protection, threat intelligence, etc., as shown <a href=\"https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/\" rel=\"nofollow\">below</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720462947305083_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1256\" data-height=\"455\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720462947305083_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"s\" width=\"640\" height=\"232\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720462947305083_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720462947305083_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720462947305083_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49663886-17720462947305083_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>www.crowdstrike.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of that, CrowdStrike's technology is deeply integrated within customers' security operations and corporate process flows (established procedures) in a trustworthy manner for years. This all means that there are high switching costs for those thinking of dumping CrowdStrike products.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last, as the IT security landscape becomes more perilous, it is unlikely for companies to entrust the protection of their critical infrastructure to AI startups using agents. The reason is that one of the good agents may go rogue (possibly as a result of being hacked by a bad actor), leading to a breach, just like in the movie <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_%282007_film%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Breach</a> (2007), where Robert Hanssen, an FBI agent, leaked top-secret information to the Soviet Union and betrayed his country. In these conditions, organizations are more likely to continue trusting CrowdStrike's cybersecurity approach, where human capabilities are augmented by AI, instead of an AI-driven competitor with no track record.</p>",

The company reported fiscal Q4 revenue<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> of $68.1 billion, up 73% y/y and exceeding the </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">average</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> consensus estimate of about $66.2 billion. This supported a better-than-expected fiscal Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.62, up 82% y/y and exceeding the average consensus estimate of about $1.54.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More importantly, data center sales remain in the spotlight. The segment grew fiscal Q4 revenue by 75% y/y towards $62.3 billion, besting the average consensus estimate of $60.4 billion by more than 3%. Robust demand signals have also increased management’s confidence that Nvidia is well-positioned to exceed the $500 billion revenue opportunity previously predicted for the current Blackwell roadmap and next-generation Rubin products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A key standout during the latest earnings update was management’s increased emphasis on scaling and optimizing “tokenomics,” diversifying from its historical focus on its best-selling GPUs. The commentary specifically alludes to intensifying power and memory constraints that have bottlenecked new data center infrastructure deployments required for scaling AI advancements. This includes the recent inflection observed in “frontier agentic systems” like Anthropic’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANTHRO\" title=\"Anthropic\">ANTHRO</a>) <a href=\"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">Claude Code</a> and <a href=\"https://openclaw.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenClaw</a>, which is expected to accelerate token demand. Yet because of the fixed power budget in data center deployments, increasing tokens per watt has become a key function of revenue and ROI optimization for both Nvidia and its customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This shift in AI compute dynamics is expected to reinforce long-term demand for Nvidia’s platform. Specifically, management has disclosed that Nvidia-based data centers currently “generate the highest revenues.” And this assertion likely implies superior unit economics as well, given management’s claims that Nvidia products currently deliver industry’s “lowest cost per token” as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, it’s evident that Nvidia’s impending upside will not just be driven by industry demand for high-performance GPUs, but also turnkey, rack-scale compute infrastructure that can help overcome inevitable bottlenecks – like power constraints. This will be essential for optimizing tokens per watt and, ultimately, AI revenue and investment returns. And Nvidia remains well-positioned to address this demand dynamic, anchored by its expanding leadership in networking for scaling AI factories, its advancing CPU roadmap focused on post-training workflows, and its CUDA software stack. This remains a competitive combination for unlocking incremental tokenomic gains critical in next-generation AI infrastructure deployments, underscoring sustained growth and valuation upside for Nvidia from current levels.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Tokenomics Explained</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tokenomics and tokens per watt were repeated themes in Nvidia’s latest earnings update.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Accelerating compute demand from generative AI and model training, now increasingly reinforced by an agentic inflection as observed in recent momentum behind Claude Code, is raising utilization across the infrastructure stack. Yet power availability – a key prerequisite for AI compute – remains a binding constraint. This dynamic has been unanimously echoed by hyperscalers in recent earnings calls, as power constraints emerge as a key bottleneck to converting end-market demand into realizable growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The dynamic has accordingly increased demand for tokens per watt optimization – or facilitating more model work out of each unit of fixed power capacity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tokens essentially refer to the units of work a model processes. For instance, when a query is submitted on ChatGPT, the prompt is broken into a “token stream” ingested by the model behind the platform. This is then transformed using compute into an output token stream that becomes the generated response. The increasing use of generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT, alongside the rapid adoption of AI agents like Claude Code and OpenClaw, is expected to accelerate the rate of token generation growth, further bringing the power bottleneck to light.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, increasing tokens per watt or performance per watt has become a critical consideration in AI unit economics. This is because tokens are the primary monetizable output that justifies AI investment spend. Because power availability is an inherent limiting factor within a data center, the ability to process more tokens per watt will essentially translate to higher revenue generated per watt. Not only so, but higher tokens per watt also effectively reduce operating costs, resulting in margin expansion and, inevitably, enhanced AI infrastructure investment returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Scaling compute-intensive AI data center builds has also become a key lever in optimizing tokens per watt. This includes “scaling up” – increasing compute density by packing more GPUs and memory bandwidth within a single server – and “scaling out” – expanding total cluster compute by enabling efficient cross-server and cross-datacenter GPU communication.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, networking is becoming increasingly mission-critical in scaling new AI infrastructure builds. Networking is essentially one of the key determinants of whether GPUs can communicate effectively and efficiently at low latency as AI clusters scale out. It also ensures optimized uptime across the infrastructure to ensure expensive GPU capacity is being fully utilized and not idled. Any networking shortfall could translate into lower utilization, higher cost per token, and weaker ROI on compute spend. (I’ve done a deep dive on scaling AI clusters and the role of networking solutions in a recent coverage <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4873570-applied-optoelectronics-the-ai-networking-dark-horse-wall-street-underestimates\">here</a> if you’re interested.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, Nvidia continues to lead across three mission-critical components, in addition to GPUs, that have become increasingly central pillars to scaling compute and improving token spend efficiency: 1) networking, 2) CUDA, and 3) CPUs. As power, space, and “AI fabric” (or AI data center networking) performance become binding constraints, these capabilities could represent additional catalysts for data center growth alongside GPU accelerator sales. It also positions Nvidia to expand its share of AI infrastructure budgets beyond GPU capex and into the broader rack-scale buildout required to convert compute into tokens and monetizable AI returns.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>1. Networking</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia’s networking revenues are primarily generated from NVLink – its scale-up solution – as well as Spectrum-X Ethernet and InfiniBand – its scale-out solutions.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>NVLink</em></strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-nvidia-nvlink/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NVLink</a> is Nvidia’s proprietary scale-up networking technology used as a “high-speed interconnect for GPU and CPU processors in accelerated systems.” Today, the technology has evolved to its fourth generation, enabling up to 18 links per GPU and aggregate bandwidth – or communication speed – at up to 900GB/s. This has accelerated the number of processors that can \"send and receive data from a shared pool of memory at lightning speed,\" enabling a competitive scale-up advantage for Nvidia’s systems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVLink 72 is currently Nvidia’s best-selling networking product, which was first launched in 2024 with the Blackwell-based <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb200-nvl72/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GB200 NVL72</a> system. Specifically, Blackwell-based GB200 and GB300 are not just GPUs but instead a coherent compute system. The GB200 NVL72 consists of 36 Grace CPUs and 72 Blackwell GPUs under an “<a href=\"https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/vera-rubin-extreme-co-design-an-evolution\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oberon rack</a>” structure, with NVLink being the critical scale-up networking solution that connects each Grace CPU with two Blackwell GPUs. Blackwell Ultra <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/gb300-nvl72/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GB300 NVL72</a> also follows a similar architecture, with NVLink unlocking up to 50x better performance per watt and 35x lower cost per token compared with the previous Hopper generation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The increasingly mission-critical role of NVLink is evidenced in its growing share of Nvidia’s data center revenues. Specifically, Nvidia’s networking sales have grown by more than 3.5x y/y to $11 billion Q4 – or about 18% of total data center sales in the period. NVLink was the primary driver, as the Grace Blackwell systems accounted for “roughly 2/3 of data center revenue in the quarter.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And Nvidia’s next-generation GPU accelerator roadmap will continue to imitate the system-based architecture like Grace Blackwell, underscoring the increasing importance of NVLink scale-up. Specifically, the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/vera-rubin-nvl72/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vera Rubin NVL72</a> will also scale 36 Vera CPUs and 72 Rubin GPUs in an Oberon rack structure. This was previously named the “<a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-unveils-rubin-cpx-a-new-class-of-gpu-designed-for-massive-context-inference\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX</a>,” as each GPU consists of two compute dies, resulting in 144 compute dies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next-generation Vera Rubin NVL72, which ships in the second half of the year, is estimated to provide “7.5x more AI performance” than its predecessor, the GB300 NVL72, while delivering “up to <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/vera-rubin-nvl72/\" rel=\"nofollow\">10x reduction</a> in inference token cost.” Nvidia estimates the next-generation Vera Rubin platform to enable monetization at $5 billion in token revenue for every $100 million invested – a critical consideration as power constraints remain the primary roadblock to hyperscaler AI deployments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The mission-critical role of NVLink scale-up technology is further evidenced in Nvidia’s enhanced Vera Rubin roadmap, which includes the <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-shows-off-rubin-ultra-with-600-000-watt-kyber-racks-and-infrastructure-coming-in-2027\" rel=\"nofollow\">NVL576</a> potentially shipping in 2H27. The system requires a “<a href=\"https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/nvidia-gtc-2025-built-for-reasoning-vera-rubin-kyber-cpo-dynamo-inference-jensen-math-feynman?open=false#%C2%A7jensen-math-changes-every-year\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kyber rack</a>” structure that’ll feature NVLink technology to scale up 288 GPU packages – or 576 compute dies. Amazon Web Services (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) is also expected to become the first external user of NVLink for scaling its in-house Trainium 4, Graviton, and AWS Nitro Systems.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>Spectrum-X Ethernet and InfiniBand</em></strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to NVLink scale-up technology, Nvidia also sells scale-out networking solutions that include its proprietary <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/spectrumx/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spectrum-X Ethernet</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/products/infiniband/\" rel=\"nofollow\">InfiniBand</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Spectrum-X was first introduced in 2023 as an optimized Ethernet solution for scaling AI clusters. It’s essentially a scale-out “package” that includes the Spectrum-X Ethernet switch for connecting racks and servers, endpoint Spectrum-X Ethernet SuperNIC adapters within the servers to facilitate low-latency cross-server communication, and supporting software to ensure smooth traffic flow and reduce network congestion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia also offers InfiniBand, which is another scale-out technology stack optimized for high-performance computing (“HPC”) applications. Unlike Ethernet, which is the most common scale-out networking standard observed in general-purpose data centers, InfiniBand was purpose-built for “ultra-fast processing.” This makes it another relevant scale-out networking solution in AI factories. Nvidia’s InfiniBand tech stack currently includes the <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/infiniband-adapters/\" rel=\"nofollow\">InfiniBand Adapters</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/infiniband-switching/\" rel=\"nofollow\">InfiniBand Switches</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/products/data-processing-unit/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BlueField DPUs</a>, InfiniBand Routers, and InfiniBand-to-Ethernet <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/infiniband/gateway-systems/\" rel=\"nofollow\">gateway systems</a> to enable “ultra-low latency, extreme throughput” in processing increasingly complex and demanding workloads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, Nvidia’s Spectrum-X Ethernet and InfiniBand solutions represent mission-critical solutions for overcoming the scale-out bottleneck, ensuring optimized uptime in AI clusters that consist of increasingly powerful GPU accelerators, and enabling conversion of compute into monetizable tokens at scale.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>2. CUDA</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As discussed in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4788603-do-you-really-understand-huaweis-threat-to-nvidia-rating-downgrade\">previous coverage</a>, CUDA’s dominant adoption across developers remains a key moat for Nvidia, effectively reinforcing stickiness across its platform offerings. However, the software stack is also rapidly emerging as a critical pillar in enabling token spend optimization, further reinforcing adoption across the Nvidia ecosystem.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, CUDA software has been improving tokens per watt on older-generation platforms, enabling “up to 5x better performance on GB200 NVL72” within four months of GB300 NVL72’s launch. This proves that Nvidia’s efficiency gains are not restricted to hardware advancements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CUDA’s advantage also compounds over time; all of Nvidia’s GPUs are “architecturally compatible.” This means that a model that’s optimized on Blackwell today can also be deployed on prior-generation chips like Hopper or Ampere. This effectively optimizes the ROI trajectory on existing installed capacity, further supporting token spend optimization demands from customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is further corroborated by CUDA’s widespread adoption. According to management, there are currently more than 1.5 million AI models on Hugging Face that run on Nvidia CUDA, underscoring the platform’s fungibility, which is critical for reducing deployment friction and, effectively, lowering costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, CUDA’s advantage is clear in keeping demand resilient within Nvidia’s ecosystem. Not only does it reinforce developer adoption and platform standardization by making workloads highly portable across Nvidia’s installed base, but it also demonstrates the capability to overcome power constraints by unlocking incremental performance and tokens per watt. This effectively helps lower cost per token and improve ROI visibility, which Nvidia’s customers increasingly demand as AI infrastructure deployments scale.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>3. CPUs</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia’s upcoming <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/vera-cpu/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vera CPU</a> shipments will represent its first standalone server processor. This compares to its predecessor, the <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-cpu-superchip/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grace CPU’s</a> debut in 2023, which was primarily deployed in rack-scale systems such as the Hopper-based <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/grace-hopper-superchip/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GH200</a> and Blackwell-based GB200 and GB300.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Vera CPU debuts at an opportune time, as server processors gain relevance in post-training workloads. A key driver is the increasing adoption of AI agents, as discussed earlier. Unlike the commonly known chatbots like ChatGPT, which respond to text prompts, AI agents can complete tasks by using “tools” like search and data retrieval systems, databases, APIs, and enterprise-specific applications (e.g., CRM, ERP systems). These “tools” are typically processed by CPUs because they’re low in complexity and less compute-intensive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For instance, CRM and ERP workloads are mostly defined by “serial” actions like sending a query and waiting for actions, which are logic-heavy and typically scale well on CPUs. This differs from complex workloads like AI training, where GPUs are needed to facilitate parallel calculations – or processing multiple tasks across multiple processors at the same time. The upcoming Vera CPUs were purpose-built for facilitating these post-training workloads, both as a standalone chip environment or in a GPU-accelerated environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The upcoming launch of Vera CPUs also coincides with increasing revenue diversification beyond hyperscaler applications. As I’ve discussed extensively in my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872936-intel-the-cpu-comeback-is-an-execution-reality-check\">recent coverage</a> on Intel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC\" title=\"Intel Corporation\">INTC</a>), CPUs are making a comeback in AI compute—especially in enterprise deployments. Specifically, enterprise end-markets are increasingly preferring upgrades of existing general-purpose data center infrastructure to accommodate AI workflows rather than engaging in costly AI factory builds. The diversification of AI workloads into high-volume inference also requires scalability, which CPUs can efficiently address. Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) currently predicts the server CPU TAM to grow in “strong double-digits in 2026” given their reprised role in supporting the ongoing AI ramp.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And Nvidia Vera’s imminent relevance in complementing the AI buildout is evident in the company’s latest data center revenue mix. Specifically, management’s disclosed that the top 5 cloud providers and hyperscalers now account for just “a little over 50%” of the company’s Q4 data center revenues. This suggests a broadening of demand to other verticals like enterprise and sovereign deployments, which the Vera CPU is a compelling solution for.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Fundamental Considerations</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Adjusting my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4844758-the-special-purpose-vehicle-spv-ecosystem-powering-nvidia-explained\">previous forecast</a> for Nvidia’s actual fiscal Q4 results and forward outlook, I expect FY 2027 revenue to grow 68% y/y to $361.7 billion.

The 1.5% perpetual growth rate approximates the anticipated pace of economic expansion across Nvidia’s core markets and reflects the rate at which its steady-state cash flows – proxied by terminal EBITDA – can grow when its business cycle matures in the longer-term.

This contrasts with previous roadblocks that were primarily driven by GPU supply constraints. As explained by Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) CEO Satya Nadella in a recent podcast interview, GPU deployment remains a function of limited power availability:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>…the biggest issue we are now having is not a compute glut, but it’s power — it’s sort of the ability to get the builds done fast enough close to power... So, if you can’t do that, you may actually have a bunch of chips sitting in inventory that I can’t plug in. In fact, that is my problem today. It’s not a supply issue of chips; it’s actually the fact that I don’t have warm shells to plug into.</p> <p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-ceo-says-the-company-doesnt-have-enough-electricity-to-install-all-the-ai-gpus-in-its-inventory-you-may-actually-have-a-bunch-of-chips-sitting-in-inventory-that-i-cant-plug-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">CEO Satya Nadella, Bg2 Podcast</a>.</em></p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This accordingly brings into light the increasing importance of optimizing tokens per watt, which Nvidia continues to deliver not just through GPU advancements but also innovations in the adjacent networking, CUDA software, and CPU roadmaps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Admittedly, execution risks remain, with a headline overhang from lingering investors’ angst over the durability of AI capex and limited visibility into related investment returns. However, it’s likely Nvidia offers a solution to this concern, which remains underappreciated.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia’s latest selloff, despite the execution consistency observed in its latest earnings results, has potentially created an opportunity to participate in an impending re-rate as AI infrastructure priorities shift. As customers move from “build at all costs” toward tokens per watt optimization – not by choice, but due to fixed power availability – Nvidia’s full-stack positioning has again emerged as a competitive advantage. It’s likely that increasing system-level bottlenecks, particularly in power and networking, could emerge as a catalyst worth watching through the year, as it influences customer buying behavior and potentially skews demand further towards Nvidia’s full-stack data center solutions. This potential steepening of its forward revenue curve could support multiple expansions from current levels, underscoring further upside potential ahead.</p>",

This has caused Geron to shift their focus from expanding RYTELO’s marketing team to a “strategic restructuring” that included laying off a large chunk of its employees. And, unfortunately, there isn’t much for investors to chew on outside of RYTELO in myelodysplastic syndrome. While RYTELO is also being evaluated in myelofibrosis—with interim results expected later this year—management has stated its base case is waiting for the final Overall Survival analysis in the second half of 2028.

It does sound less expensive, and the goal of marketing is to maximize ROI, so we'll see what comes of it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors may have also been spooked by an impending shelf registration and at-the-market filing. But management framed it as “<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874680-geron-corporation-gern-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">corporate housekeeping</a>.” While the company is flush with ~$400 million in cash, it is <em>still</em> burning through capital. So it wouldn’t be totally unexpected for them to raise cash at the expense of shareholders (dilution). But I think this is unlikely unless Geron has other plans up its sleeve (e.g., M&amp;A activity).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside of the US market, things are looking tricky. Despite achieving <a href=\"https://s201.q4cdn.com/710325604/files/doc_news/Geron-Announces-European-Commission-Approval-of-RYTELO-imetelstat-a-First-in-Class-Telomerase-Inhibitor-for-the-Treatment-of-Adults-W-QCEM9.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">European approval</a> in March 2025, Geron is not “gung ho” on shipping RYTELO overseas just yet:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>Well, so we do have a European approval, right?

It assumes that opex suddenly drops to 50% in 2027 and beyond, which may not be realistic. It also assumes that RYTELO’s revenue peaks at $400 million. But if you reference the first table earlier in the article, it is totally possible that RYTELO is peaking much earlier than usual. So the market could very well be discounting RYTELO for these reasons, and one cannot blame it for doing so.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Words</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While it’s hard to be bearish on a stock that appears undervalued, I think GERN is undervalued for good reason (maintain \"Sell\").</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">RYTELO’s market performance (e.g., flat revenues YoY) suggests that it is largely viewed as a salvage therapy in myelodysplastic syndrome. Progress in myelofibrosis remains years off, and I’m not entirely sold on IMpactMF’s prospects. Imetelstat is up against “best available therapy,” and Overall Survival is not an easy endpoint.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I am bearish on GERN, there are some things that could feasibly happen that could change my mind: improved RYTELO uptake in myelodysplastic syndrome, a clinically meaningful win in IMpactMF, encouraging pipeline developments, ex-US partnerships, and a sooner-than-expected pivot to profitability.</p>",

I had given the stock a \"Buy\" rating on this potential, along with sales of LINZESS [linaclotide] increasing. Today, I'm downgrading this stock from a \"Buy\" rating to a \"Sell.\" There are several reasons for doing so at this present time, which I'm about to go over now. The first reason is because the hope was that once Ironwood saw the data of CNP-104 treating patients with PBC, it would like what it saw.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, it would choose to exercise its option to exclusively license CNP-104 for the treatment of these liver disease patients. Unfortunately, that's not what happened at all. Upon observing the topline data from COUR Pharmaceutical Development Company, Inc. [COUR], Ironwood notified it on September 27, 2024 [<strong><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1446847/000110465924115052/tm2427582d1_ex99-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1446847/000110465924115052/tm2427582d1_ex99-1.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Pipeline Update subsection note under CNP-104</a></strong>] that it would not exercise its option to acquire an exclusive license to CNP-104. This pipeline setback is the first reason for the downgrade rating. The second reason is because the hope is that LINZESS sales would continue to increase, but something bad happened with earnings the other day. It was noted that sales decreased by 6% to $864.5 million in 2025 compared to that of 2024, with sales of $916.3 million. It believes that LINZESS had fallen short because of the phasing of gross-to-net rebate reserves and pricing headwinds for Medicare Part D.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is bullish, with a projection of a 30% increase in full-year 2026 LINZESS U.S. sales to be between $1.125 and $1.175 billion. Despite this, it remains to be seen if it can actually execute such an expected increase. What is bullish is that it met with the FDA in Q4 of 2025 to advance apraglutide as a once-weekly, long-acting synthetic glucagon-like peptide-2 [GLP-2] analog to treat patients with short bowel syndrome with intestinal failure [SBS-IF]. A phase 3 study, known as STARS-2 for this program, is expected to initiate in Q2 of 2026. The major downside is that while this program is encouraging, a regulatory application for approval is not expected to happen until maybe around 2028/2029. Plus, that is only to happen if the primary endpoint of the study is met in a statistically significant manner.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Phase 3 Study Initiation Is Bullish But Could Take Several Years For Catalyst Or Meaningful Impact</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I want to go over is a potential way that Ironwood Pharmaceuticals might be able to redeem itself and boost shareholder value. As I stated above, it believes that full-year 2026 LINZESS sales are going to increase by 30%, with a projection of sales between $1.125 and $1.175 billion. However, what it does have going for it is that it already met with the FDA in Q4 of 2025. This meeting was set in place to discuss the potential of moving apraglutide forward for the treatment of patients with short bowel syndrome with intestinal failure [SBS-IF]. As a matter of fact, there was alignment on a confirmatory phase 3 study that would be required to potentially obtain FDA approval of this drug for the treatment of these patients, to be known as STARS-2. The truth is that the company already established efficacy in a large phase 3 trial known as STARS. Before going over the clinical data released from this specific late-stage study, plus any catalysts to come from it for investors to look forward to, I believe it is first important to go over what this disorder is and what the market opportunity for the company could end up being.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.shortbowelsyndrome.com/sbs-management?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=UB+%7C+SBS+%7C+hydration/diet+%7C+GOOG+%7C+DSE+%7C+FY25&amp;utm_content=Hydration&amp;utm_term=short+gut+dehydration&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21784653015&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA9cSBmH31xuYSt4-lj_11JA3oL76H&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2dDuvbn3kgMVt7haBR2ppyqLEAMYASAAEgIwPfD_BwE#SBSdiet\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.shortbowelsyndrome.com/sbs-management?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=UB+%7C+SBS+%7C+hydration/diet+%7C+GOOG+%7C+DSE+%7C+FY25&amp;utm_content=Hydration&amp;utm_term=short+gut+dehydration&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21784653015&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA9cSBmH31xuYSt4-lj_11JA3oL76H&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI2dDuvbn3kgMVt7haBR2ppyqLEAMYASAAEgIwPfD_BwE#SBSdiet\" target=\"_blank\">Short Bowel Syndrome [SBS]</a></strong> is a type of disorder where the small intestine is surgically removed. Either that or it is damaged and dysfunctional. The problem with these items is that if the small intestine is missing or can't perform its function, then it can't adequately absorb nutrients from food. This causes malabsorption for the patient, which in turn causes a host of symptoms that these patients have to deal with, such as the following :</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em><strong>Food sensitivity</strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Bloating </strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Heartburn </strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Dehydration </strong></em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of the need for surgical removal of the small intestine, this can be caused by several reasons as well, which are :</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em><strong>Crohn's Disease </strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Blood clots of arteries to the small intestine </strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Cancer </strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Injury of some sort </strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Birth defect </strong></em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Short Bowel Syndrome with intestinal failure [SBS-IF] is just; that with a missing or ineffective intestine, nutrients can't be absorbed at all. Such patients are in desperate need of parenteral support [PS], where intravenous nutrients and fluids are given to patients. Especially when oral intake isn't even an option at all. The market opportunity in the United States alone is sufficient for the company to tackle. It is expected that the U.S. short bowel syndrome market is <strong><a href=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/short-bowel-syndrome-market-107071#:~:text=The%20global%20short%20bowel%20syndrome,such%20as%20higher%20diagnosis%20rates.\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/short-bowel-syndrome-market-107071#:~:text=The%20global%20short%20bowel%20syndrome,such%20as%20higher%20diagnosis%20rates.\" target=\"_blank\">expected to reach $1.93 billion by 2032</a></strong>. The thing is that it remains to be seen whether the company is going to be able to achieve a successful outcome from its confirmatory phase 3 STARS-2 study using its GLP-2 analog apraglutide to treat these SBS-IF patients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The thing is that the company can go after an unmet medical need for sure. There is one major reason why I believe this is the case. The main reason is that these patients are dependent on parenteral support [PS]. Why is this a bad thing? That's because the cost for such support is outrageous. Consider that the range for such PS is estimated to be <strong><a href=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/short-bowel-syndrome-market-107071#:~:text=The%20global%20short%20bowel%20syndrome,such%20as%20higher%20diagnosis%20rates.\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/short-bowel-syndrome-market-107071#:~:text=The%20global%20short%20bowel%20syndrome,such%20as%20higher%20diagnosis%20rates.\" target=\"_blank\">between $65,000 and $320,000 annually</a></strong>. Furthermore, it is not ideal to be dependent upon long-term care with PS. The reason why is because long-term use is associated with several problems like catheter sepsis, liver dysfunction, and more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is only one drug approved right now for SBS, and it is GLP-2 <strong><a href=\"https://www.gattexhcp.com/moa/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=BR+%7C+gattex+%7C+moa+%7C+GOOG+%7C+HCP+%7C+FY25&amp;utm_content=GATTEX+Core&amp;utm_term=GATTEX&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21797896036&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA9cSAXTeS1Reieo2W147vjZ5t0FH4&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlIz40Lz3kgMViKNaBR1oJS2iEAAYASAAEgJ5S_D_BwE\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.gattexhcp.com/moa/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=BR+%7C+gattex+%7C+moa+%7C+GOOG+%7C+HCP+%7C+FY25&amp;utm_content=GATTEX+Core&amp;utm_term=GATTEX&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21797896036&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA9cSAXTeS1Reieo2W147vjZ5t0FH4&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlIz40Lz3kgMViKNaBR1oJS2iEAAYASAAEgJ5S_D_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">GATTEX [teduglutide]</a></strong> from <strong>Takeda Pharmaceuticals</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TAK\" title=\"Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited\">TAK</a>). The downside, from what I see, is that this must be taken once daily as a subcutaneous [SC] injection. There is once- or twice-weekly glepaglutide from Zealand Pharma, which succeeded in phase 3 testing treating patients with SBS. However, in late 2024, it <strong><a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/19/3000220/0/en/U-S-Food-and-Drug-Administration-issues-Complete-Response-Letter-for-the-glepaglutide-New-Drug-Application-for-the-treatment-of-short-bowel-syndrome.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/19/3000220/0/en/U-S-Food-and-Drug-Administration-issues-Complete-Response-Letter-for-the-glepaglutide-New-Drug-Application-for-the-treatment-of-short-bowel-syndrome.html\" target=\"_blank\">was given a Complete Response Letter [CRL]</a></strong> citing that more data would be needed to obtain regulatory approval. From what it appears with this CRL, one phase 3 study doesn't appear to be enough to confirm benefit. That's why when Ironwood met with the FDA in April of 2025, it was notified that it must run the phase 3 confirmatory STARS-2 study in order to be able to file an NDA of apraglutide for the treatment of patients with SBS-IF.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To this end, Ironwood is preparing to initiate the confirmatory phase 3 STARS-2 trial in Q2 of 2026. The hope is that apraglutide is going to achieve statistical significance yet again with respect to the intended primary efficacy endpoint of relative change from baseline of weekly PS volume over a 24-week period. The thing is that this program appears to be a good one, but the problem is that such a study could take a few years to run. Plus, there is no way of knowing at this point if the primary efficacy endpoint is going to be met in a statistically significant manner. There is a good chance of it happening, since the company proved to achieve this very endpoint from the prior <strong><a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04627025?term=STARS%20SBS&amp;rank=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04627025?term=STARS%20SBS&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\">STARS study</a></strong>, which I'm about to go over now. The thing to note first is that there were a total of 164 patients with SBS-IF that were recruited. They were first split into two different categories in 50/50 fashion :</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em><strong>Stoma - colon lead out to create a pouch for waste to come from </strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Colon-in-continuity - normal or near-normal bowel movements still possible </strong></em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After patients were divided in this fashion, they were then randomized 2:1 to receive either of the following treatments :</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em><strong>Once-weekly apragrlutide </strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>Placebo comparator </strong></em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The primary endpoint for this STARS study is the same as that which has been established for the soon-to-be-initiated STARS-2 study. Such an endpoint is the change from baseline in actual weekly PS volume at 24 weeks. This primary endpoint, as part of the STARS study, was met in a <strong><a href=\"https://investor.ironwoodpharma.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Ironwood-Pharmaceuticals-Announces-Positive-Topline-Results-from-Global-Phase-III-Trial-of-Once-Weekly-Apraglutide-in-Adults-with-Short-Bowel-Syndrome-with-Intestinal-Failure-SBS-IF/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investor.ironwoodpharma.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Ironwood-Pharmaceuticals-Announces-Positive-Topline-Results-from-Global-Phase-III-Trial-of-Once-Weekly-Apraglutide-in-Adults-with-Short-Bowel-Syndrome-with-Intestinal-Failure-SBS-IF/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">statistically significant manner with a p-value of p=0.001</a></strong>. Another way to look at this is in terms of drop in PS volume, which is as follows :</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em><strong>-25.5 PS drop for patients who took apraglutide </strong></em></li> <li><em><strong>-12.5 PS drop for patients on placebo </strong></em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The notion here is that what was achieved for STARS must now again be replicated in STARS-2. The problem again with this is that this study has not yet been initiated and will not be done so until Q2 of 2026. Plus, it is going to be a few years before data is even released from this trial. Of course, if the primary endpoint is met, then I would expect an NDA filing of apraglutide for the treatment of patients with SBS-IF shortly thereafter. What about the competition? If the company can get data right, then it might be able to fend them off with one competitive advantage, which is dosing. Apraglutide is the only long-acting, once-weekly GLP-2 that is known to treat these patients.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financials</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ironwood Pharmaceuticals <strong><a href=\"https://investor.ironwoodpharma.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2026/Ironwood-Pharmaceuticals-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results-Achieves-2025-Financial-Guidance-and-Reiterates-Strong-2026-Outlook/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investor.ironwoodpharma.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2026/Ironwood-Pharmaceuticals-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results-Achieves-2025-Financial-Guidance-and-Reiterates-Strong-2026-Outlook/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">ended Q4 of 2025 with $215.5 million in cash</a></strong>, compared to the same time period in 2024, where it only ended with $88.6 million. Financially, the company does have debt on its books to mention. This would be in terms of the $200 million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes, which are due in June of 2026. On the flip side, it also has about $385 million in the aggregate principal amount of a Revolving Credit Facility that it can tap into. It entered into this credit facility back in 2023, and it was done to partially fund the VectivBio acquisition. Despite cash inflows from the revenues to be generated by LINZESS, plus the Revolving Credit Facility I just went over above, it believes that this will only be enough to fund its operations for at least the next 12 months. It burns roughly $41.15 million of cash per quarter. This is broken down into $21.86 million in R&amp;D expenses and then $19.29 million in SG&amp;A expenses.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks To Business</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are several risks that investors should be aware of before investing in Ironwood Pharmaceuticals. The first risk to consider is in terms of the recent guidance given, which is that it expects full-year 2026 U.S. revenues of LINZESS to increase by 30% to a range of $1.125 and $1.175 billion. The risk here is that there is no assurance that the initial headwinds observed in Q4 of 2025 won't be carried over in 2026. Nor that the company is going to be able to meet its guidance of LINZESS sales as expected for full-year 2026. Especially when you consider that from 2024 to 2025, it saw a decline in full-year sales of this drug. In 2024, it posted U.S. sales of LINZESS to be $916.3 million. However, in 2025, full-year sales decreased by 6% to $864.5 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second risk to consider would be in terms of its development of its GLP-2 analog apraglutide for the treatment of patients with SBS-IF. It gained alignment with the FDA that a confirmatory phase 3 study is going to be necessary for it to be in a future position for it to file an NDA of this drug for the treatment of these patients. The risk here is that upon the release of data from the soon-to-be initiated phase 3 STARS-2 study, there is no guarantee that the final primary endpoint of relative change from baseline of actual weekly PS volume is going to be met in a statistically significant manner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The third and final risk to consider would be that of the competition I went over above. As I mentioned beforehand, Takeda Pharmaceutical has the only GLP-2 drug approved for the treatment of patients with SBS-IF, known as GATTEX. Plus, there is the competition that could come about if Zealand Pharma can eventually obtain FDA approval of its drug glepaglutide for these patients. Where Ironwood could possibly gain a competitive edge is in terms of dosing. Its long-acting, once-weekly dosing of apraglutide could be crucial over these other therapies, which require additional dosing throughout the week. The risk here is that there is no guarantee that the final outcome from the phase 3 STARS-2 study is going to establish such a competitive advantage. Nor that apraglutide from Ironwood will be approved to treat these SBS-IF patients that it will be able to produce sufficient revenues from it.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The hope was that the company would be able to execute on several measures to continue to warrant a \"Buy\" rating from me. However, the company failed to move forward with exercising its option to exclusively license CNP-104 for the treatment of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [PBC]. This was a major setback for its pipeline and the first reason for my downgrade. The second reason, again, is because U.S. sales just posted for LINZESS in Q4 of 2025 decreased. It remains to be seen if it is going to be able to meet its full-year 2026 U.S. sales expectation guided to be in that range of $1.125 and $1.175 billion. Apraglutide appears to be going well, but it is going to be a few years before data is known for this candidate. Plus, even if the primary endpoint is met for the STARS-2 study, Ironwood would still need to be able to obtain U.S. marketing approval for it. With everything listed above, I think that this stock should be downgraded to a \"Sell\" rating.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The company has a strong AI exposure because of the strengthening foothold of its Networking Platforms<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> segment, which offers high-performance connectivity solutions for AI infrastructure. Ciena demonstrates everything that I appreciate as a value investors: accelerating revenue growth, operating leverage, a healthy balance sheet, and a stable outstanding shares count. Valuation might be a notable area of concern, but I think that highly probable positive earnings revisions after the upcoming earnings release will help mitigate this risk. Moreover, I believe that at least over the next few quarters, the power of momentum will outshine CIEN's high multiples. All in all, I assign a Buy rating to CIEN.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fundamentals and earnings preview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/77319676\">latest 10-K report</a>, Ciena is described as a network technology company that provides hardware, software, and services to a wide range of network operators. The company's major segment is Networking Platforms, which generated 77% of Ciena's consolidated sales in FQ4 2025.

However, I like the fact that it demonstrates proactiveness and flexibility, as the share of non-telco revenues has increased significantly over the last few years. As of FQ4 2025, the proportion of non-telco revenue increased to 55%, and the lion's portion of this non-telco revenue is represented by contracts with direct cloud providers. Moreover, the share of sales generated from direct cloud providers is consistently expanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721043362904837_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1297\" data-height=\"662\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721043362904837_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Ciena's latest earnings presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"327\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721043362904837_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721043362904837_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721043362904837_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721043362904837_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ciena's latest earnings presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ciena released its latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20336340-ciena-reports-fiscal-fourth-quarter-2025-and-year-end-financial-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">quarterly earnings</a> on December 11, delivering a third <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4530430-ciena-non-gaap-eps-of-0_91-beats-by-0_14-revenue-of-1_35b-beats-by-60m\">dual beat</a> in a row. Revenue increased by 20% on a YoY basis, while the EPS increased much faster, from $0.54 to $0.91. It was a high-quality EPS growth as it was powered by increased profitability ratios. Ciena's adjusted operating margin increased from 9.7% to 11.2% YoY in Q4.

For the fiscal year 2026, the management expects the adjusted operating margin to expand by almost six percentage points, to 17%. Moreover, the $5.9 billion midpoint of the revenue guidance range means that full-year revenue growth is poised to accelerate to almost 24% from the 18% increase recorded in FY2025. Therefore, Ciena's already extremely strong <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIEN/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a> with very low leverage and ample liquidity is poised to strengthen further and expand the company's financial flexibility. This is another big positive fundamental factor because Ciena invests quite aggressively in R&amp;D; <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIEN/income-statement\">~18% of sales</a> were reinvested in R&amp;D during FY2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-1772105816055346.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"424\" height=\"433\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-1772105816055346.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-1772105816055346.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ciena's FQ1 2026 earnings are around the corner as the company is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIEN/earnings\">set to report</a> on March 5. Wall Street analysts expect CIEN to deliver accelerated revenue growth compared to Q4 2025, with a projected 30% increase. The company's unit economics is expected to improve substantially as Wall Street analysts expect a staggering 81.5% adjusted EPS growth. The fact that there have been only positive <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIEN/earnings/revisions\">EPS revisions</a> over the last 90 days indicates that Wall Street analysts are extremely optimistic about CIEN's ability to deliver a solid earnings surprise next week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721060187595189.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"590\" height=\"207\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721060187595189.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721060187595189.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721060187595189.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is difficult not to agree with Wall Street's optimism because Ciena has a proven record of capitalizing on the global AI data center spending spree. The calendar Q4 earnings season of the largest investors in AI infrastructure revealed their accelerated investments in capex during the last three months of 2025. Moreover, all giants confirmed that they plan to increase investments in AI-related capex in 2026 as well. Therefore, the increasing demand for connectivity from hyperscalers creates a substantial structural tailwind for Ciena.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, during the fresh earnings release, Nvidia's management provided the public with several bullish insights regarding the longevity of AI tailwinds. According to CEO <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875147-nvidia-corporation-2026-q4-results-earnings-call-presentation\">Jensen Huang and his colleagues</a>, \"frontier agentic systems have reached an inflection point\" meaning that tokens are becoming profitable. It is a crucial development that demonstrates that the market's fears regarding uncertainty of returns from increasing AI capex were highly likely overblown.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, Nvidia's management also said during their earnings call that the next generation of its AI accelerators, the Rubin platform, will reduce inference token costs by up to 10 times compared to Blackwell. It implies that profitability per token will significantly improve further, making new investments more and more justified from an economic perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With all that being said, I expect an extremely bullish tone from Ciena's management during the next week's earnings call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721085751798923_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"867\" data-height=\"272\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721085751798923_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha\" width=\"640\" height=\"201\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721085751798923_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721085751798923_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721085751798923_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721085751798923_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the power of momentum should not be underestimated, especially when we speak about a company with expanding margins and a strong balance sheet like Ciena. The stock is gaining more attention from investors, which drives the demand and pushes the share price further. Since CIEN boasts a strong balance sheet and expanding FCF-generating capacity, shareholders are extremely unlikely to suffer from a potential dilution of equity investors via new share issues. Despite the sharp share price increase over the last twelve months, the number of outstanding shares <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIEN/balance-sheet\">was stable in 2025</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation as a major risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When any stock soars by over 300% within a year, there always will be discussions about the fairness of the company's valuation. Looking at the company's multiples, it will not be an exaggeration to say that CIEN is priced to perfection. The company's current <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIEN/valuation/metrics\">valuation ratios</a> are higher than the sector median and its own historical averages by hundreds of percent across the board.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721091528565342_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"873\" data-height=\"713\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721091528565342_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha\" width=\"640\" height=\"523\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721091528565342_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721091528565342_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721091528565342_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721091528565342_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The only ratio that looks reasonable is the forward-adjusted PEG ratio of 1.51, which is just above the sector median. The market currently prices extremely aggressive growth for years ahead, and before the AI revolution, I could have said that it is a big red flag. However, we are witnessing an unprecedented secular shift to AI, which requires vast amounts of compute power. Hyperscalers are ready to further boost aggressive investments in AI infrastructure because they already see that AI capabilities help them to unlock new revenue growth and profitability expansion drivers. With that being said, I think that CIEN is extremely likely to see many more new upward earnings revisions, which will mitigate the overvaluation risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721164579322176_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"822\" data-height=\"728\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721164579322176_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha\" width=\"640\" height=\"567\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721164579322176_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721164579322176_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721164579322176_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56545785-17721164579322176_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, CIEN's massive share price momentum is actually a two-edged sword. While a soaring share price attracts more new investors, it also urges current investors to take fat gains earned over the last twelve months. Moreover, quite aggressive insider selling in January and February might set the tone for external equity holders to sell as well. Finally, the fact that the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIEN/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">consensus target price is lower than the last close by 30%</a> might also undermine investors' desire to keep CIEN in their portfolios for longer.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To conclude, I think that CIEN is a Buy. Yes, the stock is priced to perfection. However, in the current environment of rapidly accelerating AI tailwinds, I think that we will see several additional significant upward earnings revisions. New revisions and earnings surprises will mean compression of the P/E ratio, which will inevitably improve attractiveness of CIEN for investors.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's fundamentals are solid, with a fortress balance sheet and rapidly expanding margins. Moreover, let's not forget about the power of momentum, which usually attracts additional investors and drives the demand for the stock. Since CIEN is not aggressive in issuing new shares, the highly probable increase in the demand for the company's stock will inevitably push the share price further.</p>",

Overall, the ETF does its job on a standalone basis but underperforms its peer group.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Composition - Slightly Higher Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let us see what the ETF is currently holding:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48943276-17720197984257364.png?io=w640\" alt=\"facts\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"221\" height=\"256\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Current Holdings <span>(Fund Fact Sheet)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund has a 37% allocation to high yield, a 31% investment-grade corporate allocation, a 3.3% EM allocation, and roughly 20% in securitized products (overweight CMBS). The ETF presents a further refinement in each subclass, parsing each group by rating. The general allocation, though, is summarized as such:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>HY Corp: 37%</li> <li>IG Corp: 31%</li> <li>Securitized: 20%</li> <li>EM: 3.3%</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a ratings standpoint, the current parsing is as follows:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48943276-17720200079733825.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ratings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"223\" height=\"212\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Ratings <span>(Fund Fact Sheet)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Roughly 50% of the fund holdings are investment grade, while the rest are composed of high-yield exposures. On the high-yield side, the fund is overweight higher quality BB names, which make up 24% of the fund. The ETF only has a 3.4% bucket for 'CCC' issuers. Since our article last year, the fund has increased its high-yield exposure <span>slightly</span>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other analytics for the name are as follows:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>AUM: $4.4 billion</li> <li>Expense ratio: 0.39%</li> <li>SEC yield: 5.7%</li> <li>Payment period: monthly</li> <li>Duration: 4.2 years</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Please note the ETF also increased its duration slightly from 4 years to 4.2 years since the last time we reviewed it. Given the compression in spreads overall in the market, the name is taking more credit and duration risk to make up for some of the lost yield.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Spreads Have Compressed in the Market</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the ETF does not take significant risks via its composition, it is nonetheless affected by overall IG and HY spreads. If we get another risk-off period like in April 2025, investors should expect the name to post another significant drawdown. For every 100 bps in spread widening, the fund should go down by -4.2%. Let us take a look at overall credit spreads in the market:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48943276-17720210279281607_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"725\" data-height=\"502\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48943276-17720210279281607_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"443\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48943276-17720210279281607_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48943276-17720210279281607_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48943276-17720210279281607_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48943276-17720210279281607_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IG &amp; HY spreads <span>(YCharts)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We have graphed two indices in the above, namely the US High Yield Master OAS as a proxy for high-yield spreads and the US Corporate BBB OAS as a proxy for IG spreads (namely BBB spreads). As we can see from the YChart above, both net figures are at historic lows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While high yield spreads went as high as 9% during Covid, they were as wide as 6% during 2022, while they are now at only 2.95%. Similarly, IG spreads were close to 2% during 2022 now only half. The point to be taken from the graphs above is that spreads are very, very low, and the next natural move is up (i.e., wider spreads). As we saw from the analytics section, 100 bps in widening means a -4.2% drawdown.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rating downgrade warranted</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We are looking at an ETF that has increased its risk profile<span> slightly</span>, all while spreads are very tight. We like this name, and it has performed robustly; however, the next move here will likely see a -4% to -5% drawdown, similarly to April 2025. As an investor, one can consider CGMS a low risk fund, but you want to buy when there is a dislocation in spreads, not when they are tight.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also to note, the ETF has underperformed its cohort; thus, investors have more conservative choices currently when it comes to the same type of risk. We are downgrading this ETF to 'Hold' based on the above factors. This purely means today's price is not a good entry point from a macro standpoint, all while the fund is still expected to deliver as per its analytics.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CGMS is a fixed income exchange traded fund. The name is an active take on intermediate fixed income, with allocations to IG, HY, and securitized products. The name has a low standard deviation but did produce a -4% drawdown in April 2025. Expect a similar price action for a 100 bps widening in spreads from here. We find the fund to be a robust long-term holding but do not consider today's price a good entry point.</p>",
