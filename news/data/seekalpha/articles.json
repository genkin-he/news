My 2025 pick was Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>): I believed<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the market had overestimated the threats to Google’s search businesses by AI and antitrust.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the time, Alphabet was trading at a P/E ratio of 17, compared to the S&amp;P average of 24. For Alphabet, these “existential” threats were akin to being trapped inside a speeding car with a wasp - potentially serious, in the moment, but in hindsight, more of a nuisance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, Google’s search share <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share\" rel=\"noopener\">remains around 90%</a>, and the company is integrating AI into its results. Google, not OpenAI, will likely continue to monopolize search.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of monopoly, Alphabet lost its search and advertising lawsuits, but the remedy/punishment it was given was the equivalent of me threatening (again) to take my son’s phone away (i.e., meaningless). By the way, Alphabet is up 61% year over year, second only to Tesla in the Magnificent 7.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Stock of 2026</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where the market overestimated Alphabet’s existential threats, I believe it’s underestimating Amazon’s (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a></span>) not-so-secret weapon (automation) and missing its next growth engine (retail). For more than a decade, people thought of Amazon as a cloud company with a retail unit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWS and the ad business drove its margin expansion, while on the retail side, fulfillment and shipping costs increased faster than sales. Two years ago, Amazon began to reverse that trend. Investments in automation, primarily robotics but also AI, are beginning to deliver operational leverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon is projected to have almost <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/amazon-testing-new-warehouse-robots-and-ai-tools-for-workers-8e3d885a?mod=article_inline\" rel=\"nofollow\">40 delivery fulfillment centers</a> equipped with robots by the end of next year, resulting in an estimated cost savings of $4 billion per year. A <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-robots-the-10-billion-cost-cutters-170059181.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morgan Stanley report</a> estimated that if 30% to 40% of Amazon’s orders in the U.S. are fulfilled through its next-gen warehouses by 2030, the company could save $10 billion a year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on last year’s financials, $10 billion in cost savings translates to an additional $170 billion in enterprise value. As the <em>Prof G Markets</em> team observed in our other newsletter, investors are “pricing in AWS’s dominance, but missing the retail margin story,” making Amazon one of the most underappreciated members of the Mag 7.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon’s shares are trading at 34x earnings, well below the company’s five-year average of 60x. The stock had been up around 2% so far this year, but it popped after this week’s earnings call on news that AWS revenue had beaten expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon shipping costs vs retail revenue\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_line-chart-3.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Atoms &amp; Bits</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of technology’s tectonic unlocks has been the elevation of information (bits) over objects (atoms). Our digital lives are (mostly) frictionless. One-click purchasing, personalized algorithmic feeds, and swiping right put shopping, entertainment, and mating at our fingertips.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But in the physical world, friction is the defining feature. To fulfill a one-click purchase, Amazon deploys armies of human workers, leveraging machines, global supply chains, and infrastructure. Five companies in the Mag 7 primarily move bits. One, Tesla (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA\" title=\"Tesla, Inc.\">TSLA</a>), moves atoms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Straddling both worlds, Amazon is a logistics company at its core. With <a href=\"https://maxdispatchservice.com/amazon-fleet-stats/#:~:text=Amazon%20owns%20approximately%2040%2C000%20semi,30%2C000%20branded%20delivery%20vans%20worldwide.\" rel=\"nofollow\">40,000 semitrucks</a>, 30,000 vans, and 110 aircraft (equivalent to the <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/largest-air-forces-in-the-world\" rel=\"nofollow\">armed forces</a> of Austria, Denmark, or Norway), Amazon excels at moving atoms. The company delivers <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/29/amazon-says-60percent-of-prime-orders-are-arriving-same-day-or-next-day.html#:~:text=This%20is%20up%20from%20roughly%2050%25%20in,selection%20of%20top%2Dselling%20items%20in%20each%20city.\" rel=\"nofollow\">60% of Prime orders</a> on the same or next day. According to the most recent data, almost three-quarters of Americans live within one hour of an Amazon fulfillment center.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recently, I wrote that America’s economy is one big bet on AI. That bet has inflated the valuations of companies that move bits and distracted attention from companies using automation to reduce friction in the physical world. <a href=\"https://public.com/stocks/amzn\" rel=\"noopener\">Two-thirds of Amazon’s revenue</a> comes from three segments: online retail, physical stores, and fulfillment services for third-party sellers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Those business lines account for one-third of Amazon’s operating expenses - $26 billion in the last quarter alone. The more it automates, the more Amazon can cut costs in its core business by reducing real-world friction. It’s already happening.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/amazon-warehouse-robots-automation-942b814f?&amp;mod=article_inline\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Amazon averaged roughly 670 employees per facility last year - the lowest number in 16 years. Meanwhile, those employees now handle 22x as many packages, on average, as they did a decade ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon employees per facility\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_double-line-chart.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>1 Million Robots (and Counting)</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This week, Amazon <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/27/amazon-to-announce-sweeping-corporate-job-cuts-starting-tuesday.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced plans</a> to lay off 30,000 corporate employees. That 10% reduction represents the largest cut to headcount in the company’s history, but it’s a fraction of what’s coming for warehouse workers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon’s U.S. workforce has increased 3x since 2018, to almost 1.2 million (70% of the company’s employees are based in the U.S.). But according to the <em>New York Times</em>, Amazon believes that by 2027 it can avoid hiring more than <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/technology/inside-amazons-plans-to-replace-workers-with-robots.html#:~:text=Amazon%27s%20U.S.%20work%20force%20has,packs%20and%20delivers%20to%20customers.\" rel=\"nofollow\">160,000 worker</a>s it would otherwise need in America. Ultimately, Amazon believes it can automate up to 75% of the company’s warehouse operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consider Amazon’s most recent automation milestone. In June, it deployed its <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/02/amazon-deploys-its-1-millionth-robot-in-a-sign-of-more-job-automation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">millionth robot worker</a>, putting the company on pace to have more robots than humans in its warehouses by year-end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that, just as Mark Zuckerberg, Satya Nadella, and Sundar Pichai dream of AI replacing high-priced tech talent at Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), and Alphabet, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy dreams of a robot workforce that will never unionize, get injured, demand a raise, go to the bathroom, take time off, or post about poor working conditions on social media.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At Amazon’s scale, it’s not a robot workforce, but a robot nation. One of the fears about AI is that it could build a robot army that turns on us. It’s here, it’s Amazon, and (so far) it’s not looking to kill us. It will replace a lot of us, though.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Operational industrial robots\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_Bar-Chart-.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Convergence </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon began investing in robotics a decade ago, purchasing Kiva Systems for $775 million. Since then, Amazon has identified <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/technology/amazon-robotics-automation.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">six categories of automation</a>: movement, manipulation, sorting, storage, identification and packing. A robot called Hercules moves heavy carts, while another, Pegasus, sorts and shuttles packed orders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A robotic arm called Sparrow, designed to replace human pickers, is capable of handling 200 million different products of varying sizes and weights. A new address labeler can label 3,000 packages per hour. In tests, Amazon says Sequoia, an automated inventory management system, can process packages 25% faster than its current management system at a quarter of the cost.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This year, Amazon plans to spend $100 billion to capture what Jassy called a “once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity,” adding that “the vast majority of that capex spend is on AI for AWS.” But investments in AI are paying dividends in robotics as the technologies converge.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a Citigroup <a href=\"https://ir.citi.com/gps/H558-XNr_iTlGa7Qq7H9AYb5ZT2W851WZdFgPNEDsBtSeTgp7JcaTdS_uBfLVLpwfMQYeB5O5TwV9YcIDGuGOMjE2luzQprf\" rel=\"nofollow\">report put it</a>, “AI is a huge upgrade to robotics,” allowing robots to see, move, talk, learn, and act. It’s the difference between a robot programmed to perform a task and one capable of doing any task within its physical constraints. If you’ve taken a Waymo, you’ve seen convergence firsthand — the car is a robot operated by an AI driver. At Amazon, the peanut-butter-and-chocolate combo of AI and robotics shows up in three ways:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>New products:</strong> Amazon is testing AI-enhanced robots that can cut open boxes, unpack the contents, and sort them into the correct bins.</li> <li> <strong>Faster development:</strong> Amazon deployed its newest robotic arm, Blue Jay, 3x faster than its predecessors by using AI to make virtual prototypes.</li> <li> <strong>Optimization:</strong> DeepFleet uses AI to coordinate the movement of robots across Amazon’s fulfillment network, improving robot fleet travel time by 10%.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Holy Unlock</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike other jobs, loading and unloading trucks is primarily done by humans even in the most automated warehouses. It’s the same story for last-mile delivery; Amazon’s goal is to deliver <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/31/amazon-resumes-drone-deliveries-after-two-month-pause.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">500 million packages</a> per year via drone by the end of the decade, but for now it relies on humans to deliver more than 6 billion packages annually.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is dangerous work, akin to playing <em>Tetris</em> with heavy weights, often in extreme heat or freezing cold. According to <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106413.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">BLS data</a>, transportation and warehouse workers sustain serious injuries at twice the rate of manufacturing workers and nearly 4x the rate of workers in mining, oil, and gas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last year, Tye Brady, chief technologist at Amazon Robotics, described the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-new-robotic-warehouse-will-rely-heavily-on-human-workers-f95e06b6?mod=article_inline\" rel=\"nofollow\">tactile skills</a> and situational awareness needed to load and unload a truck as the “holy grail of robotics,” adding, “we aren’t there yet.” <em>We</em> is the operative word.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This year, DHL ordered <a href=\"https://www.therobotreport.com/dhl-buying-1000-stretch-robots-from-boston-dynamics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">1,000 robot truck loaders</a> from Boston Dynamics. Through its $1 billion Industrial Innovation Fund, <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/05/rightbot-which-is-developing-robots-to-unload-freight-lands-investment-from-amazon/?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon invested in Rightbot</a>, a startup that designs robot truck loaders. As soon as a robot truck loader comes online, it’ll connect with two other robot systems - Cardinal and Proteus - that sort packages and move them to the loading dock. When that happens, some of America’s most dangerous jobs will (mostly) vanish.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Robots vs. Humans</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Automation represents a massive wealth transfer from Amazon’s workers to its shareholders and customers. Leaked documents show the company hopes to automate away <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/technology/inside-amazons-plans-to-replace-workers-with-robots.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">600,000 jobs by 2033</a>. An <a href=\"https://shapingwork.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Robots-and-Jobs-Evidence-from-US-Labor-Markets.p.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">MIT study</a> found that adding one robot to a local area reduces employment in that area by six workers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A 2019 Oxford Economics report estimated automation could <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/25/economy/robot-jobs-manufacturing-automation\" rel=\"nofollow\">displace 8.5% of the global manufacturing workforce</a> by 2030. As with AI, it’s possible that robotics will increase GDP while reducing employment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Five years ago, my friend Andrew Yang ran for president with the slogan “Humanity First.” He warned that we needed to prepare humanity if/when automation decimates labor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This year, President Trump’s bill made <a href=\"https://www.comerica.com/insights/commercial-banking/assorted-commercial/bonus-depreciation.html#:~:text=100%25%20bonus%20depreciation%20is%20now,of%20this%20renewed%20tax%20advantage.\" rel=\"nofollow\">100% bonus depreciation permanent</a> for machinery, robotics, and automation equipment, while simultaneously gutting healthcare, education, and social safety net programs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><a href=\"https://www.profgalloway.com/big-tech-stock-pick-of-2026-amazon/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Original Post</a></em></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

I applauded the business for being a strong long-term performer, having found a solid balance between organic and inorganic growth, all combined<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> with solid long-term capital allocation skills.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following long-term gains seen by investors, valuation multiples have been on the increase as well, and the resulting earnings multiple in the low-thirties was a bit demanding, even as the long-term performance has been impressive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fast-forwarding half a year in time, shares trade rather flattish; in fact, they have been trading down a percent or two, while the market at large has seen double-digit share price gains.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Solving For Safer</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Motorola Solutions develops, builds, and creates technologies that allow for the protection of people, property, and places. Spun-off from Motorola in 2011, the company became a pure play on providing such solutions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Such technologies are, for instance, applied to video security, access controls, but also LMR communications and command centers. Applications in video security include fixed video security, in-car videos, body cameras. LMR is the definition of land mobile communications, in which Motorola provides such solutions for both public and private communication applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Command center applications include, for instance, 911 call center equipment. The extent of all these products is vast, including over 5 million fixed video cameras deployed, some 13,000 LMR networks installed, and over 3,600 911 call centers equipped with Motorola's equipment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company generates about $11 billion in annual sales, with some $7 billion in revenues stemming from products &amp; systems, complemented by software &amp; service, the latter being largely recurring revenues. In terms of segments, nearly $2 billion in sales are coming from video security, about $8 billion from mission-critical networks, and nearly a billion from command center revenues. About 70% of sales are tied to public safety and the remainder to enterprise clients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company claims to target more than $80 billion in total addressable markets, as the business has seen strong growth in recent years. Over the past decade, revenues have essentially doubled to nearly $11 billion in 2024, with non-GAAP operating margins rising no less than 10 points towards 30% of sales, aided by the faster growing software revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note that organic growth was combined with dozens of acquisitions over this period of time, coming at a combined purchase price in excess of $10 billion. Moreover, Motorola managed to buy back about one in every six shares over this period of time as well, with sales growth, margin expansion, and buybacks all helping to drive earnings per share growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this pushed up shares in a huge fashion, as well as a $70 stock in 2015 that peaked around the $500 mark in 2024, and after a period of relative stagnation this year, shares are down to $410 at this point in time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Perspectives</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In February of this year, Motorola reported an 8% increase in 2024 sales to $10.8 billion, with adjusted operating margins rising by a point to 29% of sales, allowing adjusted earnings to rise by some 16% to $13.84 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net debt of $4 billion just exceeded a $3.5 billion reported EBITDA number, yet a stock trading in the low $400s was trading around 30 times earnings. However, if one strips out stock-based compensation expenses, earnings trended closer to $12.50 per share, pushing up realistic earnings multiples towards 33 times earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company guided for 2025 sales to rise by some 5.5%, with adjusted earnings seen at a midpoint of $14.69 per share. Following a solid first quarter earnings report, Motorola announced a larger deal in May. Motorola reached a $4.4 billion deal to acquire LA-based Silvus Technologies, a transaction set to double net debt to $9 billion. With this deal, the company would acquire mobile ad-hoc technology, known as MANET, used for secure communication that no longer needs fixed networks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valued at 10 times sales, while Motorola traded around 7 times, the deal was expensive. However, the EBITDA margins of Silvus were reported some 13 points higher than Motorola, at around 45% of sales. With leverage ratios seen up to the mid-2s, and realistic earnings seen up to $13.00-$13.50 per share this year, multiples were still demanding in the low thirties, too high to see appeal for me here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Motorola closed the deal with Silvus in August, which meant that the acquisition made a partial contribution to the third quarter results, released by the end of October.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third quarter reported sales <a href=\"https://www.motorolasolutions.com/content/dam/msi/investors/doc_financials/2025/q3/msi_q3_2025_earnings_release_and_financial_tables.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">rose</a> by 8% to $3.01 billion, with product sales up 6% and software &amp; services sales up 11%. Adjusted margins rose by nearly another point to exceed 30% of sales here, with adjusted earnings up 9% to $4.06 per share. The backlog is up 3% on an annual basis to $14.6 billion, as growth in the backlog has been trailing reported revenue growth for a while now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net debt is reported at $8.5 billion, a bit lower than the pro forma numbers in May, driven by retained earnings, as leverage is not a major concern with leverage ratios in the mid-2s; in fact, these are down to 2.3 times based on trailing EBITDA reported here. Aided by a full contribution from Silvus in the fourth quarter, revenues are seen up 11% on the year in the final quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The midpoint of the full year adjusted earnings guidance is now set at $15.12, up fifteen cents from the previous guidance. With stock-based compensation expenses trending around $1.70 per share, realistic earnings are only seen around $13.50 per share, resulting in a 30 times realistic earnings multiple seen this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares fell some 5% on the back of these results, as they hit a high in the high $400s in recent weeks, as the market is not impressed by the guidance, also as the company trades at very demanding multiples here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">And Now?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With organic growth trending in the mid-single digits here, the bar is high in terms of expectations. Frankly, this has been casting a shadow over the shares so far this year, as I see no appeal here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the company continues to grow along just fine, and I like the bolt-on M&amp;A performed, I am hard-pressed to see appeal here, making me still very cautious to get involved with the shares here.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares remain a bit too pricey, even if appeal might be on the increase, as I look forward to continuing to update the thesis following continued share price stagnation and/or interesting buybacks.</p>",

This year, despite the inescapable return of bubble banter among the financial chattering class, the S&amp;P 500 has added 2.3 percent to its year-to-date price performance since the end of September.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Second Half Surge</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, much of the market’s giddiness in recent weeks has happened in that very same segment of mega-cap AI-themed stocks that has generated the lion’s share of the bubble chatter. It was not always thus. For the first half of the year, the so-called Magnificent Seven and its posse of AI fellow travelers didn’t stand out in any meaningful way from the rest of the market. The chart below shows the year-to-date relative performance of the S&amp;P 500 benchmark index, which is weighted by market capitalization and thus influenced in an outsize manner by the movements of the largest companies, and the S&amp;P 500 equal-weighted index (which, as the name suggests, takes away the influence of the market cap factor).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_chart_10_31_25.png?io=w640\" alt=\"S&amp;P 500 market cap vs. equal weight\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"892\" height=\"567\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_chart_10_31_25.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_chart_10_31_25.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_chart_10_31_25.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_chart_10_31_25.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_chart_10_31_25.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_chart_10_31_25.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_chart_10_31_25.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_chart_10_31_25.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The acceleration of the Big Tech-concentrated second-half surge was on prominent view this week. On Tuesday, the S&amp;P 500 finished in positive territory largely thanks to just two names – Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) and Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) – while 75 percent of the companies in the index finished lower on the day, as did eight of the 11 main industry sectors. On Thursday, shares of Alphabet (Google’s parent company) jumped three percent even while the index itself lost nearly one percent as investors responded to a more hawkish than expected report from the Federal Open Market Committee the day before. This morning (Friday), Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) is up nearly 12 percent on the day following a blockbuster earnings report delivered after yesterday’s market close. Amazon’s strength, which has little to do with Prime shipments of Halloween tchotchkes and lots to do with robust demand for AI and cloud services from its AWS business segment, seems to be giving the AI optimist crowd an argument against the many recent concerns expressed about the apparent circularity of the AI ecosystem.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The End Is Nigh… Near… Never…</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s one thing to observe a bubble and proclaim its existence; it’s another thing entirely to predict how much longer the animal spirits have to run. After all, Alan Greenspan made his “irrational exuberance” comments about the building tech bubble in 1996, several years before the thing finally imploded in March 2000. The AI infrastructure bonanza does not appear to be on track to end any time soon. Among the tidbits to take away from this week’s earnings reports was the tidy sum of $80 billion in capital expenditures on AI-related items by just three companies – Microsoft, Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) and Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) – with much more than that promised for the year ahead. The build-out of data centers to power the large language models for AI software is increasingly a must-have component for GDP growth. According to a recent analysis by Harvard economist Jason Furman, investment in data centers and information processing technology accounted for virtually all the GDP growth for the first half of this year. As long as this multibillion-dollar spending frenzy occurs, it seems, the economy has a pretty solid cushion against falling into negative growth. Of course, when and if all this spending turns into real productivity across the economy is the question that will keep us all guessing for the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the bubble talk won’t be fading away any time soon. Keep an eye on that relative performance trend between the market cap and equal cap indexes, which is likely to look quite different on the other side of a bursting bubble.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://mvfinancial.com/news/mv-weekly-market-flash-big-tech-goes-into-overdrive-again/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

However, this does not mean I should doubt PVAL's potential as well, as its performance this year speaks for itself.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And even in a scenario with a valuation reset (a 28.8x weighted average Price/Earnings ratio of the S&amp;P 500 index does look quite elevated), as we can deduce from PVAL's past performance (cautiously, of course, as past returns guarantee nothing in the future), it should do much better than the market (an around 84% downside capture ratio is what I am referring to).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So now, let us delve into all the details and discuss what is so special about PVAL.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Basics of The Putnam Focused Large Cap Value ETF</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Inception: May 25, 2021</li> <li>Investment Manager: Putnam Investment Management, LLC</li> <li>Total Net Assets: $4.95 billion, as of October 30</li> <li>Net Expense Ratio: 0.56%</li> <li>3-Year Annualized Return (October 2022–September 2025): 23.04% vs. 24.9% of the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVV\" title=\"iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF\">IVV</a>) and 16.71% of the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWD\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF\">IWD</a>)</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">PVAL Strategy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we know from the Franklin Templeton <a href=\"https://www.franklintempleton.com/investments/options/exchange-traded-funds/products/39434/SINGLCLASS/putnam-focused-large-cap-value-etf/PVAL\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>, incepted in May 2021, PVAL is managed actively, seeking \"capital growth and current income.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As explained on page 2 of the summary prospectus, PVAL</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>...invests mainly in common stocks of U.S. companies, with a focus on value stocks that offer the potential for capital growth, current income, or both.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From the exact same page, we know that large-cap companies are defined as those \"...of a size similar to those in the Russell 1000 Value Index.\" And this index is PVAL's benchmark, as per the factsheet. However, it is also added that the ETF can venture into the mid-size universe as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As to the valuation characteristics, Putnam Investment Management, LLC, the ETF's investment manager, decides whether a company is \"...currently undervalued by the market\" or not.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">PVAL Is An Active Nontransparent ETF</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When assessing PVAL, investors should pay close attention to the fact that this vehicle is nontransparent. In practice, this means that the ETF publishes its detailed portfolio monthly and not daily.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of writing this article, the most recent portfolio available on the PVAL website was as of September 30, 2025. And even though the tracking basket is released on each business day, I should remind you that securities inside it are not what the fund actually holds (there should be an overlap though).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So being an ANT ETF has essentially two sides.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>On the one hand, it is quite beneficial, as traders who have strategies based on copying funds' most promising ideas (the result can be these funds' top ideas failing, which is not pleasant) have close to zero chances here (alas, not zero).</li> <li>On the other hand, a few quite sensitive issues arise.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For instance, as explained by PVAL:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>You may have to pay more money to trade the ETF's shares. This ETF will provide less information to traders, who tend to charge more for trades when they have less information.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More details on risks and disadvantages can be found in the prospectus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Obviously, as I have already explained in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829323-tdvg-solid-dividend-growth-but-low-yield-mixed-returns-hold\">article</a> on the T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TDVG\" title=\"T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth ETF\">TDVG</a>), the ANT approach creates understandable challenges for ETF researchers, as they simply have no up-to-date holdings to analyze and thus have to make certain compromises.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The solution I use in my articles on the ANT vehicles is that I take the most recent financial metrics (today, the data I am using is as of October 31) and pair them with the most recent portfolio available. Thus, we can get a general understanding of an ETF's factor mix, but of course it is far from perfect. This is what we will be doing today.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">PVAL Portfolio Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of September 30, PVAL had a portfolio of 46 holdings, 45 of them being equities and one being quite a significant cash position with a 2.62% weight. Citigroup Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/C\" title=\"Citigroup Inc.\">C</a>) was the top name, with a 4.18% weight. Here, I should note that at least as of September, the ETF was quite bullish on the financial sector overall, with a 20.13% allocation, which makes it more of a contrarian play compared to IVV, which is enamored of IT.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-1761955559107831.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ETFs comparison\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"563\" height=\"359\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-1761955559107831.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-1761955559107831.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-1761955559107831.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-1761955559107831.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-1761955559107831.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-1761955559107831.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-1761955559107831.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-1761955559107831.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Weights as of October 30 for IWD and IVV and September 30 for PVAL <span>(Created by the author using data from the ETFs and Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Compared to IWD, the ETF that tracks its benchmark, PVAL is underweight in six sectors, the key two among them being communication and real estate.

However, its adjusted weighted average earnings yield is the highest compared to those of IWD and IVV, while EV/EBITDA and Price/Sales are the lowest.</li> <li>It is a bit growthier than IWD, as illustrated by the weighted average forward growth rates.</li> <li>Nevertheless, compared to the Russell 1000 Value ETF, it has a slightly smaller exposure to stocks with a B- Quant Profitability grade or higher. At the same time, its return on total capital and return on assets are stronger.</li> <li>IVV looks mostly stronger than PVAL, but it is also meaningfully more expensive.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Is So Special About PVAL's Performance?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a lot to appreciate about PVAL's performance. Put shortly, it has outperformed IVV and IWD (the ETF that tracks its benchmark) since inception, delivered excellent results compared to the Large Value subclass, and has demonstrated fairly healthy risk characteristics. Let us address all these one by one.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">PVAL Outperformance Since Inception</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since May 26, 2021, PVAL has outperformed IVV by approximately 6.17%. It has beaten IVE, IWD, and RPV with ease.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_759f59e45667278775d2bcaf05c5375d.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_759f59e45667278775d2bcaf05c5375d.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_759f59e45667278775d2bcaf05c5375d.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_759f59e45667278775d2bcaf05c5375d.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_759f59e45667278775d2bcaf05c5375d.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_759f59e45667278775d2bcaf05c5375d.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_759f59e45667278775d2bcaf05c5375d.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_759f59e45667278775d2bcaf05c5375d.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_759f59e45667278775d2bcaf05c5375d.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

Japan, a major export economy, is especially exposed. A 15% tariff was established as part of a deal involving $550 billion in Japanese investments in the U.S.—lower than the 27.5% initially threatened by President Trump but significantly higher than the rate Japan enjoyed prior to his second term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While exporters navigate tariff headwinds, a weaker yen has offered some relief, partially offsetting the pressure. Following its rally earlier this year, the current JPY/USD spot rate at the time of writing sits about 7% below its April peak.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amid these crosscurrents, the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Index—which is tilted toward dividend-paying exporters and seeks to replicate local equity returns—returned 27.94% over the one-year period ended September 30, outperforming its benchmark, the <a href=\"https://www.wisdomtree.com/blog/glossary#msci-japan-index\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener\">MSCI Japan index</a>, in both Japanese yen and U.S. dollar terms.

Goldhar entered into a joint venture with Walmart in 100 shopping centres. Mitchell Goldhar, owns a 20% equity stake in the trust, ensuring alignment between management and the value-creating interests of unit holders. Golhar continues to buy units of SmartCentres, with a <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/inside-the-market/article-mondays-insider-report-ceo-invests-over-1-million-in-this-high/?cmpid=rss\" rel=\"nofollow\">notable</a> purchase of 43,700 units in December 2024 for $1.1M.

In the decade since that merger, SmartCentres has diversified to include residential, including condos, townhomes, apartments, and self-storage. The REIT owns 35 million square feet of income producing properties and 3,500 acres of land. SmartCentres is advancing an ambitious development pipeline of 86 million square feet of mixed-use developments.

The REIT's ability to execute its densification option will be highly correlated to its balance sheet flexibility to execute large projects. For a close look at SmartCentres densification strategy, see my previous coverage: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4602129-smartcentres-reit-smart-value-creation-through-intensification\">SmartCentres REIT: Smart Value Creation Through Intensification</a></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Distribution</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SmartCentres has paid a distribution for 22 consecutive years. During this period, the REIT has reliably and consistently paid unit holders. At current unit prices, the annualized payout of $1.85 per unit offers unitholders a 6.8% distribution yield. SmartCentres current yield is slightly below its 4-year average yield of 7.13%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SmartCentres has a trailing twelve month FFO payout ratio of 77.7% and a trailing twelve-month AFFO payout ratio of 95.8%. The REIT’s forward AFFO payout ratio of 93.2% indicates improving cash flow available for distribution. I mention both FFO and AFFO because they provide different information. As a standardized metric, FFO is helpful to compare between different REITs. AFFO is the more useful indicator of how much cash is really available for distribution. At current levels, SmartCentres is paying out essentially all of its distributable income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This monthly distribution of $0.15417 per unit has been flat since October 2019. While I always prefer to see a distribution that increases with the pace of inflation, in the retail REITs space, it is notable that SmartCentres has managed to maintain its distribution. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Crombie REIT (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRR.UN:CA\" title=\"Crombie Real Estate Investment Trust\">CRR.UN:CA</a>) and RioCan REIT (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/REI.UN:CA\" title=\"RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust\">REI.UN:CA</a>) both slashed their distributions. While Crombie has resumed their payments at pre-COVID levels, RioCan’s distribution is still below its 2020 levels. Despite not being in a position to raise its distribution in recent years, SmartCentres has prudently managed their distribution levels to avoid a cut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"836\" data-height=\"436\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SmartCentres Distribution History\" width=\"640\" height=\"334\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-176153984612295_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">SmartCentres Distribution History <span>(SmartCentres Investor Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SmartCentres has tended to focus on its distribution as the primary mechanism of returning capital to shareholders. The REIT hasn’t initiated a unit buyback program since the expiry of its normal course issuer bid in 2022.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the last two decades, the overhanging headline risk for retail REITs has been the tendency for online retail to supplant the need for brick and mortar square footage. While online retail growth continues, REITs including SmartCentres have adjusted their portfolio mixes to be more defensive to these pressures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at Walmart, for example, the company has made itself indispensable for in-person retail through investments in its grocery and DIY business lines. Serving as both in person retail experiences and fulfilment centres for grocery delivery, Walmart has leveraged its brick-and-mortar footprint. Shares of Walmart are up 27% over the last 12 months, compared to 21% for Amazon, a fully online retailer. In addition to Walmart, other major tenants include grocers like Loblaw Cos. Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/L:CA\" title=\"Loblaw Companies Limited\">L:CA</a>) and Sobeys Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EMP.A:CA\" title=\"Empire Company Limited\">EMP.A:CA</a>), as well established retailers Dollarama Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOL:CA\" title=\"Dollarama Inc.\">DOL:CA</a>), TJX Companies Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TJX\" title=\"The TJX Companies, Inc.\">TJX</a>), and Canadian Tire Corp. Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTC:CA\" title=\"Canadian Tire Corporation, Limited\">CTC:CA</a>). These creditworthy tenants offer stability and defensiveness to the REIT's occupancy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At 23% of revenue, the concentration in leased space to Walmart presents some revenue diversification risk; however, I see the quality of revenue here as outweighing the concentration risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-17615397976809425.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SmartCentres Tenant Mix\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"420\" height=\"438\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-17615397976809425.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-17615397976809425.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-17615397976809425.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-17615397976809425.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-17615397976809425.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-17615397976809425.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-17615397976809425.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/7506841-17615397976809425.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">SmartCentres Tenant Mix <span>(SmartCentres Investor Presentation )</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance Sheet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SmartCentres has approximately $1.15B in <a href=\"https://smartcentres.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Q2-2025-MDA.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">available</a> liquidity including $875M available on its operating facility and an additional $250M accordion facility. Should the company ever need to deleverage, it also has the option of divesting some of its raw land <a href=\"https://smartcentres.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Q2-2025-Financial-Statements.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">assets</a> or tapping its large, and growing unencumbered asset pool of $9.6B.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unchanged from the previous quarter, SmartCentres had adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA of 9.6X for the 12-month <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4811325-smartcentres-real-estate-investment-trust-cwyuf-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">period</a> ending in Q2.

SmartCentres debt carries a weighted average term to maturity of 3.1 years with a weighted average interest rate of 3.94%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Canadian retail REIT sector has been a destination for capital investment in the last year.

Morningstar DBRS expects EBITDA interest coverage to fluctuate at the current level, of around mid 2X range in the near-to-medium term.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The ratings agency <a href=\"https://dbrs.morningstar.com/research/459909/morningstar-dbrs-confirms-smartcentres-real-estate-investment-trusts-credit-ratings-at-bbb-with-stable-trends\" rel=\"nofollow\">confirmed</a> that it would consider a ratings upgrade if SmartCentres were able to improve leverage to less than 9.2X EBITDA, while improving and maintaining interest coverage to more than 2.7X.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investor Takeaways</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Verdict</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SmartCentres is an accomplished operator with an enviable track record of maintaining structurally full occupancy across its portfolio. SmartCentres has an opportunity to grow NOI through the densification of its current property portfolio, the development of its raw land. While the REIT has reasonable liquidity and has been successful in raising debt when needed, its leverage is at the high end of the sector average and may limit the capacity and magnitude of development plans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my previous <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4602129-smartcentres-reit-smart-value-creation-through-intensification\">coverage</a> of SmartCentres in May 2023, I rated the REIT a <strong>buy</strong> on its growth potential and high-quality property base. While I continue to see SmartCentres as the highest quality operator in the Canadian retail REIT space, I am downgrading the REIT to a <strong>hold</strong> on its slow progress in deleveraging and stagnant distribution yield. While income-focused investors could add SmartCentres at current levels, unit price appreciation is likely to remain tepid as the REIT's growth is financed through debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While SmartCentres is a high-quality REIT offering attractive income, its elevated leverage is a concern. I would prefer to see SmartCentres prioritize deleveraging with the proceeds of any divestments. The REIT's high AFFO payout ratio makes it unlikely the distribution will be increased in the near term. SmartCentres 6.9% distribution yield is backed by quality cash flow and supported by a 22-year record of uninterrupted distribution payments.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking Ahead</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SmartCentres is set to release its Q3 results on Wednesday, November 12, 2025. Investors will want to look for updates on the REIT's capital recycling program and how proceeds will be deployed to maximize unitholder value. Income seekers can also look for signs of an improving payout ratio that would give line of sight to the prospect of resuming distribution increases.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

As generative AI models grow more capable and associated hardware becomes cheaper and more versatile, we’re rapidly advancing into the era of physical AI, where networks of machines can think, see, move, and act in real time to augment human workflows.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This shift carries profound implications. Human labor productivity could be supercharged as people increasingly deploy robots for physical tasks. Entirely new use cases will emerge across sectors such as last-mile logistics, self-driving, and robotic manufacturing. Ultimately, this could culminate in Humanoid systems advancing, as general-purpose physical AI brings intelligent automation to everyday businesses and households. In our view, Robotics &amp; Physical AI form a defining theme of the intelligence age. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Manufacturing’s Automation Shift Is Now an Economic Imperative</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Manufacturing has long been central to robotics adoption. Global stock of industrial robots already totals roughly 4.7 million, offering automation a healthy installed base into a core sector of the economy.<sup>1</sup> That adoption is expected to further accelerate as new priorities such as reshoring and reindustrialization take shape in strategic industries such as semiconductors and electric vehicle (EV) components.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2024, new global industrial robot installations reached 542,000 units, more than doubling over the past decade and marking the second-highest annual installation count of industrial robots in history.<sup>2</sup> Asia accounted for 74% of new deployments, compared with 16% in Europe and 9% in the Americas. Annual installations are projected to rise another 6% in 2025 and surpass 700,000 units by 2028, underscoring automation’s steady advance.<sup> 3</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Falling automation costs and rising labor expenses further reinforce the structural global reshoring shift. Average U.S. hourly manufacturing wages reached $34 in 2025, and are expected to rise to $39 by decades end.<sup>4</sup> Meanwhile, the average cost of an industrial robot is expected to continue to compress, while functionalities improve.<sup>5</sup> These dynamics enable a greater quantity and flexibility of robotic systems to operate in a wider range of settings, shifting the economic advantage in favor of automation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Robots are also getting smarter and more flexible due to AI. Rather than the rigid, fixed setups of the past, software-defined robot platforms with standardized interfaces enable plug-and-play adaptation. This modularization reduces downtime, supports reconfiguration, and lowers integration risk. In effect, companies get the economics of mass customization. Continuous improvements in algorithms, semiconductor efficiency, and power systems are accelerating this shift.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Collaborative robots, or cobots, are also expanding the frontier of industrial automation. Designed to work safely alongside humans, they take on hazardous, repetitive, or precision tasks at a fraction of the cost, allowing workers to focus on higher-value activities such as design, supervision, and decision-making.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"3651\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251010 - Charting Disruption_01-0.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"701\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_01-0.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Robotics Is Advancing Rapidly Across Services</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Improving intelligence is helping Robotics move rapidly beyond factory floors into the everyday economy, such as warehouses, hospitals, delivery networks, and retail spaces. These segments face chronic labor shortages, high turnover, and rising expectations for speed and precision, creating ideal conditions for automation to thrive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In logistics, autonomous mobile robots now manage everything from pallet movement to last-mile sorting. Amazon alone operates over one million warehouse robots worldwide by using fleets like Proteus and Sparrow to transport and identify packages with minimal human input.<sup>6</sup> Walmart, FedEx, and DHL are also integrating robotics to stabilize throughput and protect against labor volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In healthcare, surgical robots are transforming the operating room by enhancing precision, reducing recovery times, and expanding access to complex procedures. In 2025, it’s estimated that roughly 50% of surgeons perform some type of general robotics surgery, up from just 9% in 2012.<sup>7</sup> Intuitive Surgical’s da Vinci installed robot base has nearly doubled in the last five years, reaching 10,488 installed units in June 2025.<sup>8</sup> Beyond the operating room, hospitals use autonomous systems for medication delivery, sanitation, and patient mobility support, freeing up nurses and technicians to focus on direct care.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In retail, robots increasingly monitor shelf inventory, restocking items, and cleaning aisles. In hospitality, autonomous butlers and delivery bots are increasingly common in hotels across Asia and the U.S., handling room service and concierge logistics. The food industry has begun to implement automated kitchen arms that assemble burgers, brew coffee, and mix drinks with precision and consistency. And in transportation, autonomous robotaxis and delivery pods travel city streets, building toward a future where goods and people move seamlessly through networks of intelligent machines. Since launching its commercial service in 2018, Waymo now handles over 250,000 driverless trips across five major U.S. cities.<sup>9</sup></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Evolution of Physical AI Culminates in Humanoid Development</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.globalxetfs.com/articles/the-rise-of-humanoids-explained\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer noopener\">Humanoid robots</a> are emerging as the next major frontier in physical automation, bridging the gap between industrial machinery and intelligent, adaptive assistants designed for human environments. Unlike traditional factory robots, which are fixed and specialized, humanoids walk, see, manipulate objects, and communicate naturally. They’re designed for the spaces people already inhabit, such as warehouses, hospitals, offices, and eventually homes, giving them enormous potential to address global labor shortages, support aging populations, and unlock new forms of productivity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market opportunity is vast. Humanoid adoption could touch roughly one-third of industrial labor roles and up to 15% of global households by the mid-2030s, translating to nearly $5 trillion in total economic potential.<sup>10</sup> Pilots for early prototypes, such as Agility Robotics’ Digit and Figure’s humanoid models, are already underway in logistics and manufacturing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By 2030, it’s estimated that global annual humanoid sales could reach 1 million, just 17 years after commercial humanoid sales began. By 2040, cumulative humanoid unit sales could potentially reach 400 million.<sup>11</sup> Such a trajectory would closely parallel the early expansion of the automobile industry, which similarly took about 17 years to progress from initial commercialization to 1 million units sold.<sup>12</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6668\" data-height=\"4584\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w640\" alt=\"251010 - Charting Disruption_02-1.png\" width=\"1280\" height=\"880\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/saupload_251010_20-_20Charting_20Disruption_02-1.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Physical Intelligence Starts to Make Its Mark</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The rise of Robotics and Physical AI marks a structural transformation in the global economy, as intelligence extends from the digital realm into the physical world. Automation that once centered on manufacturing is now advancing across a wide range of industries, improving productivity, precision, and scalability. As humanoid and autonomous systems evolve, they will increasingly bridge the gap between industrial capability and human adaptability. Collectively, these developments position Robotics and Physical AI as a defining investment theme of the intelligence age – one with the potential to reshape productivity, open new markets, and drive long-term economic growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>IFR.

For those not familiar with the enterprise, it operates as a ‘daytime dining’ a company that serves<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> customers made-to-order breakfasts, brunches, and lunches. The reason why the company jumped out was because one of its locations is actually quite close to my house and because I have eaten from it on multiple occasions. So naturally, as a foodie and an investor, I would want to dig in more. What I found is a vibrant company that's growing at a rapid pace. Often, these types of firms have a tendency to be expensive. But not this one. In fact, based on my own estimates that I believe to be relatively conservative, I would argue that it offers market beating potential moving forward. As such, I have no problem rating it a ‘buy’ at this time.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I do think that one thing that investors should be mindful of is that earnings are coming up soon. Before the market opens on November 4th, management should be serving up financial results covering the third quarter of the company's 2025 fiscal year. Leading up to that point, revenue and profits are both forecasted to rise nicely. But in this uncertain economic climate, investors would be wise to keep a close eye on matters.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Digging Into First Watch Restaurant Group</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I mentioned already, First Watch Restaurant Group is a daytime dining firm <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1789940/000178994025000010/fwrg-20241229.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">that is focused</a> on preparing for its customers made-to-order breakfasts, brunches, and lunches. In my head, I fit it into the same category as a Bob Evans or <strong>Denny's</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DENN\" title=\"Denny's Corporation\">DENN</a>). However, this firm is unique in that its <a href=\"https://investors.firstwatch.com/static-files/192042db-bbf5-48d1-85a4-25c643c17cc4\" rel=\"nofollow\">locations</a> are typically only open for 7.5 hours a day. You would think that such restrictive hours would make it hard for the locations that it has to perform well. But even with this, the average restaurant generates around $2.2 million worth of revenue each year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company makes itself stand out in a couple of ways. For starters, management makes sure to keep their menu fresh. In the second quarter of this year, for instance, some of the items that it had on its menu included bacon cheddar cornbread, wild berry lavender French toast, a bacon, egg, and cheddar sandwich, and pineapple beverages. Other examples would be its blueberry lemon cornbread, shrimp and grits, and more. This menu is then supercharged through the use of fresh and quality ingredients. I don't know about you, but the number of times I have been to a restaurant that did not take that simple and obvious principle to heart, has been astronomical.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2238\" data-height=\"876\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"251\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"251\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846888912716_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In recent years, management has achieved remarkable growth. Back in 2022, revenue stood at $730.2 million. Last year, sales had grown to $1.02 billion. This growth was driven largely by an increase in the number of locations that the firm has in operation. They grew from 474 to 572 over this window of time. However, this growth is a bit deceptive. During that three-year window, the number of franchised locations actually contracted from 108 to 83. And the number of company-owned restaurants jumped from 366 to 489. By shifting away from franchised locations and toward company-owned ones, management is able to capture more revenue and to better control the quality of the experience for customers. The downside to this, however, is that there is a risk of lower margins. But by prioritizing scaling at the rest strong level, management likely hopes to offset this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2018\" data-height=\"888\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"282\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"282\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847088080797_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Same restaurant sales have also increased, but this picture is more nuanced. 2022 saw an increase of 14.5% on a same restaurant basis. This is almost certainly because of the economy recovering after the COVID-19 pandemic. There was another 7.6% increase in 2023, though in 2024 there was a decline of 0.5% as traffic fell 4%. I do know that consumers are becoming increasingly constrained from a financial standpoint. And the fact of the matter is that eating out is practically always more expensive than eating at home. The good news is that this year, things are looking up. But before we touch on that, I do think touching on bottom line performance for the company is appropriate also.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1812\" data-height=\"904\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"319\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"319\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616842634416718_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The first chart in this article shows that, as revenue for the institution grew, so too did profitability. This included net income, operating cash flow, adjusted operating cash flow that essentially just strips out changes in working capital, and EBITDA. In the chart above, you can see that, while this year the firm is seeing some downside from a margin perspective, the restaurant level total profit margin that the company has exhibited has increased as it has grown. This further validates my previous statement regarding the firm's motivation to shift more and more toward an ownership approach to its expansion as opposed to a franchise-based one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2220\" data-height=\"874\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"252\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"252\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616847255640438_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For this year, revenue for the company continues to expand. Sales during the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1789940/000178994025000072/fwrg-20250629.htm#i7db0b3c4416f43dab44d60642fe1b548_85\" rel=\"nofollow\">first half of 2025</a> amounted to $590.1 million. That's up 17.8% compared to the $501 million the company reported last year. Some of this was because of a 2.1% increase in same restaurant sales. But the vast majority came from a jump in the number of restaurants from 538 to 600. This came at a time when the number of franchised locations declined from 79 to 69, and was driven by a surge in the number of company-owned locations from 459 to 531.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to this year, management expects the total number of net new restaurants to increase by between 59 and 64. Between 7 and 9 of these will be franchised locations. But mostly, the company is adding between 55 and 58 company owned restaurants. This should help to propel EBITDA to between $119 million and $123 million. But as I mentioned already, this year the firm has suffered from some margin contraction. While some of this is because of higher labor and other related expenses, a lot of it seems to come from a rise in food and beverage costs. Management blamed this on new restaurants that it acquired, and the lower margins they typically result in, as well as commodity inflation and the firm's decision to shift toward a meat heavy menu. So we are going to see some profit increase, but as the chart that shows financial results for the first half of this year demonstrates, profitability as a percentage of revenue is certainly going to decline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1830\" data-height=\"884\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trading Multiples\" width=\"640\" height=\"309\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"309\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616843092213087_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the chart above, you can see how shares of the company are currently priced using estimates for 2025 and historical results for 2024.

This is because the economics of growth makes sense here. According to management, the typical build-out cost of a single location is $1.75 million. But over the ensuing three years, the average revenue achieved by these locations is around $2.7 million. And given the 18% to 20% restaurant level operating margin, we get an internal rate of return of around 18% or greater for each store. That's why management is dedicated this year to spending $148 million to $152 million on capital projects, with most of that focused on growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Projecting into the future is always fraught with uncertainty. But by using some reasonable assumptions, such as the firm's target of a 3.5% same store sales increase each year, the same margins that the company exhibited last year since I suspect it will be able to eventually return to those levels thanks to scalability and raising its prices to offset higher costs, and by using some other reasonable estimates, I was able to create the table below. In it, you can see how much the company could expand if it decides not to take on any additional debt and uses all excess capital toward growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1604\" data-height=\"1268\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Projections\" width=\"640\" height=\"506\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"506\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684338522391_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming this ends up being the case, we can see how, by the year 2030, the company could grow to generate $2.16 billion in revenue, with system wide sales of about $2.47 billion. If we use these as base level estimates for the future, we can then see in the chart below how much annual upside the company should exhibit if it trades at the same multiples that it's trading for today. Considering that the S&amp;P 500 typically averages between 10% and 11% annually, I would consider these potential returns to justify a bullish outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1808\" data-height=\"886\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Upside\" width=\"640\" height=\"314\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"314\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-17616846539674478_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, anything can change as new data comes in. It just so happens that, before the market opens on November 4th, management will be announcing financial results for the third quarter of the 2025 fiscal year. Analysts currently <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FWRG/earnings\">expect</a> revenue to come in at $309.3 million, which would be up 22.9% compared to the $251.6 million the company reported a year earlier. They also expect earnings per share to grow from $0.03 to $0.07, which would take net profits up from $2.1 million to $4.4 million. As the table below illustrates, the firm did generate positive cash flow in the third quarter of last year. And I would venture to say that if revenue and profits do increase this year, these cash flow metrics will grow also.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1364\" data-height=\"410\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Estimates\" width=\"640\" height=\"192\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"192\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/9866571-1761684668173443_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on all the data currently available, I would say that First Watch Restaurant Group justifies a bullish outlook. Management is actively working to grow the business, and the overall trajectory that it has been on is impressive. My own analysis, which assumes management does not lever up in order to grow more rapidly, seems to show conservatively that upside is likely to exceed what the broader market would enjoy. And with analysts optimistic as well, I have no reason not to be myself. Because of this, I believe that assigning it a 'buy' rating is the right choice.</p>",

This suggests that in the YTD, industrial occupancy is a little under 100%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The firm’s Mining Royalty Lands Segment owns around 16,648 acres of properties that are leased for rents and royalties purposes, and 4,280 acres as part of a Brooksville joint venture with Vulcan Materials Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VMC\" title=\"Vulcan Materials Company\">VMC</a>). Of these assets, only one is in Virginia, and the rest are in Florida and Georgia. In Q2 2025, the segment’s NOI increased by 21% to $3.67 million as royalty payments and unrealized revenues recovered from the year prior. In the YTD, NOI increased by 20% to $6.95 million due to a recovery in royalty payments and unrealized revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FRP’s Development Segment owns and monitors its development land and seeks to convert it from non-income-producing to income-producing by building income generating assets such as apartments, or selling them or doing a joint venture.

Development Segment properties that are built up are transferred to this segment when some threshold occupancy rate is achieved. In Q2 2025, pro rata NOI rose by 1% to $4.74 million, while in the YTD, it increased by 2% to $9.37 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One thing is clear: the business model is asset-heavy, and so, at a minimum, returns will be very low, given the capital that is needed to fund expansion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Betting on the Bakers</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FRP’s executive chairman and former CEO, John D. Baker II owns around 17.5% of the company, while members of his family own 17.8% of the company, and his son, John D. Baker III serves as the current CEO. This means that the Bakers have a lot of influence in the Board of Directors and in the running of the company. Investors have to trust that the interests of the Bakers are aligned with theirs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Declining Profitability</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since 2020, the company’s revenue has grown from $17.89 million to $32.29 million in the trailing <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"twelve\" htloopnumber=\"292897251\">twelve</em> months (TTM). However, the firm’s profitability has declined since then, from $12.72 million to $5.33 million. The firm’s margins have been poor. While operating margin has risen from -3.11% in 2020 to -0.13% in the TTM, they still show that the business’ core operations are not generating a profit. Profit margins have declined from 71.06% in 2020 to 16.5% in the TTM. The company only started measuring NOI in 2021? and that has grown from $17.6 million to $39.39 million. Baker III has guided for flat NOI in full-year 2025, saying,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>“that level of growth, while remarkable, is also unsustainable.</p> <p>Due to the timing of construction, delivery, and investment, we expect NOI in 2025 to remain flat if not slightly off of 2024. In the Industrial and Commercial Segment, 53% of the platform will be vacant and up for renewal. These vacancies at Cranberry and at our new Chelsea building will take time to lease-up and will have operating expenses that will eat into 2025 NOI when compared to 2024. The lease-up of <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"three\" htloopnumber=\"292897251\">three</em> different projects (Verge, Bryant Street, and .408 Jackson) in our Multifamily segment was a huge driver of 2024 NOI growth. The rapid NOI growth we experienced with the lease-ups will give way in 2025 to more organic growth as we grow rents on already stabilized assets, a particular challenge for the DC assets which will be competing with a glut of new projects. Mining royalties should remain strong in 2025, though from an NOI perspective, it will be difficult to keep pace with 2024, simply for the fact that we received a considerable back dated minimum payment at one location, which we can’t replicate for obvious reasons.”</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That also seems to imply that net income will also be flat or down from 2024 levels. The firm’s efficiency levels are poor: returns on assets (ROA) have risen from -0.07% to -0.00%, and return on equity (ROE) has declined from 3.03% to 1.17%. This is to be expected: the business model is asset heavy, so returns even at the best of times are likely to be low. That they are negative suggests that the company does not have the ability to extract more income from its value chain. Returns are likely to decline further: Baker III spoke of 2025 as “year zero” of FRP’s industrial growth strategy, outlining plans to, “build <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"three\" htloopnumber=\"292897251\">three</em> new industrial projects every <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"two\" htloopnumber=\"292897251\">two</em> years for the foreseeable future and look to double the size of our industrial platform over the next <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"five\" htloopnumber=\"292897251\">five</em> years”. These investments may pay off in future, but, in the interim, they will erode returns.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Has Downsides</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the current price, FRP has a price/earnings (P/E) multiple of 82.29, compared to an average of 106.52 for <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FRPH/peers/comparison?axis=linear&amp;metric=pe_ratio\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FRPH/peers/comparison?axis=linear&amp;metric=pe_ratio\" target=\"_blank\">its peers</a>, IRSA Inversiones y Representaciones Sociedad Anónima (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IRS\" title=\"IRSA Inversiones y Representaciones Sociedad Anónima\">IRS</a>), Corporación Inmobiliaria Vesta, S.A.B. de C.V.

This is clear from its declining net income, negative operating margins, and abysmal ROA and ROE, all of which signal a business struggling to profit from its operations. Furthermore, its current valuation, with a P/E ratio of 82.29, carries significant downsides. Management's own guidance for flat NOI in 2025, coupled with the significant capital required to execute its \"year zero\" industrial expansion plan, promises continued pressure on profitability and returns for the foreseeable future. As a result, the company’s share price is likely to continue to fare badly and I assign the stock a “Sell” rating.</p>",

Each stage – from the materials that power production to the applications transforming industries – builds on the one before it, creating a continuous cycle of progress. Understanding how these forces interact offers a clearer view of where disruption begins, how it scales, and where tomorrow’s opportunities may emerge.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Exhaustible Resources: Securing the Foundations of Innovation</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Technological progress begins with access to finite materials that power production, electrification, and the infrastructure on which modern economies depend.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Copper, also known as the \"metal of electrification,\" is seeing a sharp rise in demand due to its high electrical conductivity and malleability, perfect for use in medical devices and EVs, as well as solar and wind energy.<sup>1</sup> </li> <li>Due to their use in EVs – not to mention smartphones, laptops, power tools, and cameras – the demand for lithium-ion batteries is projected to grow seven-fold between 2022 and 2030.<sup>2</sup> </li> <li>Permanent magnets accounted for 42.5% of rare earth element demand in 2023 for their use in electronics, such as cell phones, and clean energy systems, such as fuel cells.<sup>3</sup> </li> <li>Silver’s high electrical conductivity, strong thermal conductivity, antimicrobial properties, and ability to reflect 95-99% of visible light makes it critical to industrial applications such as solar panels.<sup>4</sup> </li> <li>Using AI to help generate a 100-word email uses just over one bottle of water.<sup>5</sup> </li> <li>Less than ten pellets of uranium fuel – approximately the weight of 10 AA batteries – can power the average household for a year.<sup>6</sup> </li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sustaining technological progress depends not only on discovery but on the reliable availability of the materials that make it possible.

Trillions in investment will be required to replace aging assets, expand grid capacity, and build the physical backbone for a more digital, electrified, and interconnected world. These structural systems – spanning transportation, manufacturing, and energy – serve as the bridge between physical resources and technological progress. Their evolution will dictate how efficiently economies can adapt to disruption, support innovation, and sustain resilience in an era defined by accelerated change.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Enabling Technologies: Powering the Digital Core</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Digital and computational systems such as semiconductors, data centers, and cloud infrastructure provide the backbone for automation, scalability, and innovation across industries.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Surge in accelerated computing is compelling chipmakers and equipment suppliers to ramp and retool for sub-5 nm semiconductor production, critical for producing next-gen processing hardware. By 2030, nearly $500 billion could be spent annually on AI chips, driving at least half a trillion in semi manufacturing CapEx.<sup>12</sup> </li> <li>To meet the anticipated 2030 global data center demand, projections estimate an investment need of nearly $7 trillion – $5.2 trillion for facilities supporting AI processing and $1.5 trillion for traditional IT applications.<sup>13</sup> </li> <li>Propelled by rapid advances in smaller, more efficient models, the cost of running inference at GPT-3.5 performance levels fell more than 280-fold between November 2022 and October 2024, as hardware expenses declined by roughly 30% per year and energy efficiency improved by about 40% annually.<sup>14</sup> </li> <li>Global cloud infrastructure spending is projected to surpass $400 billion in 2025, with approximately 60% of the market captured by Amazon Web Services (30%), Microsoft’s Azure (20%), and Google Cloud (13%).<sup>15</sup> </li> <li>Cybersecurity remains a top priority for businesses and individuals, as the Federal Bureau of Investigation revealed over $16 billion in losses due to cybercrime in 2024, up 33% from 2023.<sup>16</sup> </li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The surge in computing power, connectivity, and automation underscores a new phase of efficiency and intelligence across industries. From semiconductors to cloud networks, technological capacity is compounding – reducing costs, expanding scale, and transforming what’s possible. As innovation accelerates, these enabling systems no longer function as support infrastructure alone; they have become the engines of transformation themselves. Their continued advancement will shape how effectively new applications emerge, connect, and redefine the modern economy.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Applications: Turning Innovation into Impact</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Innovation ultimately finds meaning through real-world use – transforming ideas into solutions that redefine industries, improve lives, and drive global growth.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>In addition to success rates between 94% and 100%, robot-assisted surgeries may offer several patient benefits, including reduced postoperative discomfort, lower likelihood of infection, minimized blood loss, shortened hospital recovery times, and less visible scarring.<sup>17</sup> </li> <li>Cheap and adaptable drones offer significant economic advantages in warfare over traditional tanks, costing 25,000 times less, reducing time to build by 4,380 times, and offering 50,000 times the production capacity.<sup>18,19,20</sup> </li> <li>Global EV sales surpassed 17 million units in 2024, pushing their share of the global car market above 20% for the first time.<sup>21</sup> With affordability improving across regions, EVs are on track to exceed a 40% market share by 2030.<sup>22</sup> </li> <li>Currently, drugs take about 10-15 years and $1.8 billion to develop, while just 10% of investigational treatments gain approval, but AI can help reduce pre-clinical delays and lower costs by up to 50%.<sup>23,24,25,26</sup> </li> <li>GLP-1 therapies continue to demonstrate strong potential for weight management and a wide range of other health applications, contributing to projected revenues of $183 billion by 2032.<sup>27</sup> </li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As these innovations mature, their influence extends beyond individual sectors – shaping productivity, resilience, and global competitiveness.
