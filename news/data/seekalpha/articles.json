I'll discuss these fundamentals in the article below, and I hope that at the end of it, you'll agree that AVLV's active and balanced approach is deserving of a \"buy\" rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Per its <a href=\"https://www.avantisinvestors.com/avantis-investments/avantis-us-large-cap-value-etf/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">website</a>, AVLV's primary investment objective is long-term capital appreciation, though it does offer a modest 1.20% dividend yield that's in line with broad market funds like SPY. The website also provides a brief overview of the active strategy used, as follows:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. Invests in a broad set of U.S. large-cap companies and is designed to increase expected returns by focusing on firms trading at what we believe are low valuations with higher profitability ratios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. Pursues the benefits associated with indexing (diversification, low turnover, transparency of exposures), but with the ability to add value by making investment decisions using information in current prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. Efficiency portfolio management and trading process that is designed to enhance returns while seeking to reduce unnecessary risks and costs for investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">4. Built to fit seamlessly into an investor's asset allocation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, AVLV is designed to be a high-quality, well-diversified fund that trades at favorable valuation ratios, and a quick glance at my latest factor scores confirms this description is reasonably accurate. As the table shows, AVLV's 44.3% concentration in its top ten sub-industries is quite low, and its 6.81/10 value score is the best of the four. Arguably, its 6.85/10 quality score could be better, but the counterpoint to that is that AVLV doesn't really have any significant gaps on any factor. That, along with its low 0.15% expense ratio, is the appeal, and it's why I labeled it an \"affordable all-weather large-cap value ETF\" two years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720389172041955_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1742\" data-height=\"220\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720389172041955_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AVLV vs. CGDV vs. VTV vs. SPY Factor Scores\" width=\"640\" height=\"81\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720389172041955_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720389172041955_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720389172041955_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720389172041955_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor (ETF Compare Tool)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CGDV and SPY have some gaps on the value and size factors, which explains why they've mostly missed out on this year's rotation. Meanwhile, VTV, like AVLV, also has good value and size factor exposure, but its 2.25/10 growth score could cause trouble if growth stocks rebound this year, and its 3.18/10 sentiment score suggests its holdings aren't delivering the kinds of earnings surprises required to sustain their recent price momentum.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV Performance Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Broadly speaking, that's my fundamental take on each ETF, but before diving into the specific statistics that lead to these scores, I want to look at AVLV's performance. Unfortunately, in order to include CGDV in the analysis, I had to exclude AVLV's returns prior to March 2022 (seven months), but it should still be helpful in understanding the kinds of returns AVLV shareholders can expect in bull and bear markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720398210796447_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1741\" data-height=\"423\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720398210796447_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AVLV vs. CGDV vs. VTV vs. SPY Performance Statistics\" width=\"640\" height=\"155\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720398210796447_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720398210796447_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720398210796447_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720398210796447_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor (ETF Performance Analytics Tool)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown, AVLV's 14.66% annualized returns since March 2022 ranked second best, as did its risk-adjusted returns (0.65 Sharpe Ratio) and downside risk-adjusted returns (0.98 Sortino Ratio). Its 17.57% standard deviation is slightly alarming, but its maximum drawdown and worst twelve-month figures were in line with VTV's, and that's something I believe is aided by its decent quality score. High-quality stocks, at least as I define them, have strong margins and high capital efficiency ratios, and it's my belief that these make them bounce back reasonably fast after market downturns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Being resilient is a necessary part of AVLV's strategy because it's actually the only ETF in this group to have a single-month loss of more than 10% (-11.9% in June 2022). Fortunately, AVLV gained 8.1% the following month and 13.0% in October 2022, so its high standard deviation figure is simply a reminder that investors should be able to tolerate large price swings in both directions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772040115620746_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1742\" data-height=\"817\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772040115620746_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AVLV vs. CGDV vs. VTV vs. SPY Performance Returns Distribution Profile - Balanced\" width=\"640\" height=\"300\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772040115620746_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772040115620746_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772040115620746_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772040115620746_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor (ETF Performance Analytics Tool)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV Fundamental Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I mentioned, AVLV's strength is that it's fundamentally well-balanced, which is why I've included statistics covering each of the major factors for its top 20 holdings. Again, diversification is a strength, with just 43% allocated to these 20 stocks, but generally, I hope you'll agree that AVLV has very few weak spots right now, which is why it's such a good choice right now regardless of the market environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720409267409804_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1758\" data-height=\"921\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720409267409804_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AVLV Fundamental Analysis - Top 20 Holdings\" width=\"640\" height=\"335\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720409267409804_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720409267409804_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720409267409804_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720409267409804_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor (ETF Snapshots Tool)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, AVLV's five-year portfolio beta of 1.02 is a bit elevated for a large-cap value fund, especially compared to VTV's 0.85. However, I don't think that's too big of an issue for investors with a moderate time horizon, and if you're trying to decide between the two, I'd like to highlight AVLV's superior return on total capital (14.58% vs. 10.58%). This key capital efficiency ratio means AVLV's holdings rely less on external financing than VTV's, and it's worth noting that AVLV also holds the advantage on ROA (9.97% vs. 6.46%) and ROE (26.98% vs. 20.70%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV is the cheapest of the four funds based on its 20.55x and 17.38x trailing and forward P/E ratios. It also offers a decent three-year historical EPS growth rate of 7.79% and an 11.55% one-year estimated EPS, which, once again, are superior to VTV. While you can technically get better growth for the price with CGDV or SPY, that's not AVLV's purpose. In a rotation to value, investors focus more on valuation ratios than growth rates, and that's why \"cheap\" funds like AVLV and VTV are outperforming this year. Even ETFs with terrible portfolio-level growth rates, like the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHD\" title=\"Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF\">SCHD</a>), are doing well, but the difference is that AVLV at least offers moderate earnings growth. That's why it easily outperformed SCHD from 2023 to 2025 and only modestly underperformed it in 2022 and 2026, the two years when value stock strategies were rewarded.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772049016623029_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1744\" data-height=\"284\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772049016623029_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AVLV vs. SCHD Performance Comparison\" width=\"640\" height=\"104\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772049016623029_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772049016623029_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772049016623029_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-1772049016623029_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I want to end on AVLV's strong diversification, further evidenced by its balanced sector mix where no sector accounts for more than 17% of the fund. In contrast, CGDV and SPY are more reliant on Technology at 28% and 33%, respectively, while VTV is 24% Financials. These compositions might work better in certain market regimes, but for consistently solid results, a balanced approach works best, which I believe will appeal most to passive investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720520089385364_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1748\" data-height=\"617\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720520089385364_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AVLV vs. CGDV vs. VTV vs. SPY Sector Allocation Analysis\" width=\"640\" height=\"226\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720520089385364_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720520089385364_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720520089385364_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51194860-17720520089385364_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor (ETF Sector Comparison Tool)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Recommendation</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV's holdings may have changed since my review two years ago, but I'm pleased to see that management continues to take a well-diversified and well-balanced approach to large-cap value investing. In my opinion, that's appropriate for a core holding, and from a factor perspective, I don't see any major weaknesses worth flagging. Therefore, I've decided to reiterate my \"buy\" rating on AVLV, and I look forward to keeping the discussion going in the comments section below. Thank you for reading.</p>",

There are two segments within the company: Americas and International. The company has more than 13,000 employees around the globe and sports a current market cap just shy of $14B. As shown in the chart below, Allegion has underperformed the broad market, as measured by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>, by a significant margin over the past decade, returning less than 200%, while SPY has a total return north of 300%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/saupload_2a7447967393897ff46c94283b336770.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/saupload_2a7447967393897ff46c94283b336770.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/saupload_2a7447967393897ff46c94283b336770.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/saupload_2a7447967393897ff46c94283b336770.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Quality Financial Metrics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Personally, I believe there are three key quantitative metrics that all high-quality companies should possess: a growing revenue stream, stable margins, and a healthy return on invested capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The revenue per share for ALLE has grown at a solid pace over the past ten years, with 2020 providing the only down year, and it was minimal at just 3.3%. Following the pandemic, the RPS came back stronger, as it increased more than 8% in 2021 and climbed double-digits in 2022 (16%) and 2023 (11%). Since then it has continued to increase with a modest 4% rise in 2024 and another almost 10% jump last year. The revenue per share growth has been incredibly consistent, with 3-, 5-, and 10-year CAGRs all hovering between 8% and 9%, aided by management reducing the outstanding shares by approximately 10M over the past decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The gross profit margin has been relatively stable with some expansion mixed in. As indicated by the green line below, the GPM has typically lingered around the low 40s, with a chart low in 2022 a tick above 40%. Since that bottom point, this metric has climbed each year, achieving 43% in 2023, 44% in 2024, and more than 45% last fiscal year. The GPM expansion has stemmed from operational improvements, accretive acquisitions, and shedding non-core product lines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The final metric I want to look at is the return on invested capital, which is shown by the orange line on the chart. This metric has dwindled lower over the years, as it was at a chart high in 2018 at more than 20% before dipping to a low in 2020 of a still respectable 13.6%. Since then it's yet to eclipse the 20% mark again, coming in around 17% in 2023 and 2024 and just below 16% in fiscal 2025. I normally like to see an ROIC above 20%, and ideally ALLE will be able to surpass this target in the near future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771856566598986_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1438\" data-height=\"860\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771856566598986_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Allegion ALLE revenue per share RPS gross profit margin GPM return on invested capital ROIC\" width=\"640\" height=\"383\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771856566598986_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771856566598986_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771856566598986_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771856566598986_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Created by author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Data</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the past year, Allegion paid a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share; however, earlier this month, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4547575-allegion-raises-quarterly-dividend-by-8-to-055share\">the company raised its dividend by 8%</a> to $0.55. Following this dividend hike, Allegion now pays a forward dividend yield of around 1.37%, about 17% lower than it was a year ago. The dividend growth has slowed over the years but still remains above inflation, as the 10-year CAGR sits at more than 17%, while the 3 and 5-year CAGRs are more in line with the recent increase. The payout ratio has hovered around 30% over the last half-decade, which should enable the company to easily continue to raise its dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-17718752226241536_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1438\" data-height=\"864\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-17718752226241536_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Allegion ALLE dividend per share DPS payout ratio\" width=\"640\" height=\"385\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-17718752226241536_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-17718752226241536_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-17718752226241536_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-17718752226241536_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Created by Author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recent Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last week Allegion announced their Q4 2025 results, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.94, missing expectations by $0.04, on revenue of $1.03B, which also came up short of analyst estimates by about $5M. This revenue figure was a year-over-year increase of more than 9% overall and 3.3% organically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Americas segment posted a revenue jump of more than 6%, climbing from $750M to almost $800M, which was driven by a high-single-digit increase from the non-residential division. Strategic pricing and strong demand contributed to the success but were also aided by accretive acquisitions like Next Door Company and Trimco Hardware. Moreover, operating income also increased by over 6%, while the operating margin grew an immaterial amount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the Americas segment posted solid figures, the international segment fared much better, with revenue jumping from $193.8M to $237.7M, a 21% surge. Much of this increase occurred due to acquisitions too, with ALLE acquiring Lemaar in Australia, UAP Group in the U.K., and ELATEC, which is a German business known for RFID readers. Favorable foreign exchange rates also boosted these results, delivering a positive effect of almost 8%. However, it's worth noting that organic revenue in this segment declined a little more than 2% due to weak demand for mechanical products. Lastly, the operating income in this segment soared more than 66% to around $30M, mostly due to the aforementioned acquisitions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management also provided 2026 guidance, which projects organic revenue growth of 3% at the midpoint (compared to 4.1% in FY25), and total growth of 6% at the midpoint, supported by continued acquisitions and strong demand from the electronics business unit in the international market. Additionally, the company estimates 2026 earnings per share to be between $8.00 and $8.20, while adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $8.70 to $8.90.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the market was not fond of the earnings release, which can be read/listened to here, with shares tanking around 10%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The final consideration is to determine if ALLE is trading for an attractive valuation at its current levels, and in order to do so, we'll examine it from a free cash flow perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To give a little more context, I estimate a stock's implied fair value based on its free cash flow yield and specifically how the current yield compares to its historical average. This helps me gauge how much investors have typically been willing to pay for a company's free cash flow and how attractive the stock looks today relative to that history. The analysis is calculated on 12 years of daily historical price data, capturing the rolling 5-year average free cash flow yield for the past 7 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key assumption behind this valuation model is that investors have paid a fair price for the stock over the past 5 years, on average. However, since every valuation is an estimate, there is a +/-10% margin of error applied to the fair value range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771876349765985_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1456\" data-height=\"856\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771876349765985_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Allegion ALLE free cash flow valuation free cash flow/price free cash flow/p fcf/price fcf/p\" width=\"640\" height=\"376\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771876349765985_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771876349765985_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771876349765985_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/18824771-1771876349765985_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Created by Author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on my custom valuation model, shares of Allegion look to be trading for a moderate discount to their fair value, with a current price of about $158 and an estimated fair value slightly above $170. The company has seen strong free cash flow growth since 2023, when it jumped 30%, and 2024 and 2025 incurred double-digit increases, leading to the rise in valuation zones.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The estimated long-term expected rate of return for Allegion is a healthy 11.14%, with the components of that figure coming from a forward dividend yield of 1.31%, a return to fair value factor of 1.92%, and an approximate future earnings growth rate of near 8%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, Allegion has performed well for itself over the past ten years but has come up short compared to the overall market. The company has some encouraging financials, with robust revenue per share growth, expanding margins, and a pretty consistent return on invested capital. The dividend has been paid and raised for over a decade, with stable dividend growth just shy of 10%. The recent earnings report was not well-received by the market, but it might've given investors a potentially good entry point.</p>",

I've maintained that bullish outlook since the company's IPO. Even though I acknowledge that my January buy call was ill-timed (I certainly wasn't predicting the sharp selloff in tech that would ensue), my thesis on Figure remains sound. I view the company as an incredibly differentiated innovator in the blockchain that is poised to displace and take market share from incumbent lenders: not just in mortgage originations, but now in auto financing as well. I reiterate my <strong>buy </strong>rating here. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Figure's immense growth within its existing consumer loan marketplace is astounding (more detail in the next section), but what investors should be aware of today is the fact that the company is planning a broad extension of its platform in 2026. Figure built its platform and its name brand around one type of loan, the HELOC (home equity line of credit). But in itself, HELOC loans are relatively niche product that form a very small share of overall borrowing. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2026, the company is focused on expanding two loan types. The first is primary, first-lien mortgages. Already, the company is showcasing tremendous growth in first lien, with volumes rising roughly 3x y/y in the fourth quarter to $506 million. Still, first lien (standard mortgages) represents only 19% of the company's origination volume. Figure's management also notes that it typically is able to issue a standard mortgage with a total cost of under $1,000 (thanks to automating many manual portions of the underwriting process, and with higher credit accuracy) versus an industry average of $11,045, marking a clear advantage for lenders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498713590522_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2320\" data-height=\"1202\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498713590522_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure first lien issuance trends\" width=\"640\" height=\"332\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"332\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498713590522_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498713590522_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498713590522_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498713590522_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure first lien issuance trends <span>(Figure Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next expansion area is completely beyond housing. Figure has <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/agora-data-partners-with-figure-to-tokenize-auto-loans-93CH-4529801\" rel=\"nofollow\">struck a partnership</a> with a company called Agora Data, which describes itself as an AI-powered intelligence platform for auto loan originators to predict performance of subprime auto loans and to connect lenders to capital. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Agora gives Figure easy access to its base of auto lenders, marking its first foray into an auto lending TAM that is sized at a staggering $1.6 trillion. While Agora's platform is responsible for origination in this deal (which is Figure's role in home loans), Figure's role is to use its newly-launched Figure Connect to tokenize these loans into assets on the blockchain: which makes it easier and less costly for auto loan originators to securitize and sell their loans using the Figure platform. In my view, it's an excellent expansion of Figure's use cases, and a great utilization of Figure Connect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498904108462_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2318\" data-height=\"1086\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498904108462_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure auto lending\" width=\"640\" height=\"300\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498904108462_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498904108462_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498904108462_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721498904108462_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure auto lending <span>(Figure Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, with so many tailwinds ahead for Figure in 2026, there is little reason for this stock to crash post-earnings. Take advantage of the dip as a buying opportunity.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 Download</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's now go through Figure's latest quarterly results in greater detail. The Q4 earnings summary is shown below:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499047433324_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1278\" data-height=\"1202\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499047433324_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure Q4 results\" width=\"640\" height=\"602\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"602\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499047433324_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499047433324_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499047433324_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499047433324_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure Q4 results <span>(Figure Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Figure's revenue grew 91% y/y to $159.9 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $157.7 million (+88% y/y) by three-point margin. Important to note is the fact that Figure's revenue accelerated sharply from just 55% y/y growth in Q3. Similar to the prior quarter, Figure's y/y surge in revenue was driven primarily by Figure Exchange, the company's crypto trading platform which launched in midway through 2024 (revenue recorded in the \"ecosystem and technology fees\" line. Still, we note that crypto trading is only one-quarter of the company's overall revenue (despite now having negative associations with the crypto sector that has brought down Figure's stock tremendously). </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Core lines of business, meanwhile, also thrived. The chart below showcases the company's main business driver: the amount of loans originated through the company's platform. Consumer loan marketplace volume surged 131% y/y to $2.71 billion in Q4, which accelerated versus just 63% full-year growth across the entirety of FY25.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499189176812_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1274\" data-height=\"332\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499189176812_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure loan volumes\" width=\"640\" height=\"167\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"167\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499189176812_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499189176812_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499189176812_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499189176812_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure loan volumes <span>(Figure Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, it's the expansion of loan types that is potentially feeding growth acceleration here, as the company focuses more on first-lien originations (which not only is a larger market than home equity lines, but also tend to have higher loan balances). The company's 2026 foray into auto loans should only serve to add fuel to recent growth trends. We note as well that Figure's take rates (its revenue as a percentage of origination volume) jumped 30bps y/y to 3.8%, which is a major tailwind for revenue growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue from the company's loan servicing arm grew 30% y/y to $9.0 million, while loan originations grew 65% y/y to $22.4 million. We focus on these core lending activities because they are Figure's \"bread and butter\" and provide recurring revenue for the company, even if Figure Exchange's crypto trading results become choppier heading into 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the profitability front, Figure's adjusted EBITDA grew roughly 5x y/y to $81.3 million, representing a 51.6% margin that improved more than 30 points y/y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499322975366_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1288\" data-height=\"902\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499322975366_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure adjusted EBITDA\" width=\"640\" height=\"448\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"448\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499322975366_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499322975366_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499322975366_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721499322975366_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure adjusted EBITDA <span>(Figure Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has a near-term goal of hitting 60% adjusted EBITDA margins, which it's driving via a greater mix of capital-light, third-party loans as well as efficiencies and automation applied to the company's own overhead. Per CFO Minchung Kgil's remarks on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875872-figure-technology-solutions-inc-figr-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 earnings call:</a></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Our medium-term goal for adjusted EBITDA margin is to be above 60%, and our progress this quarter can be explained as follows: First, we are growing volume and assets in Figure Connect and democratized Prime that reduce balance sheet usage and improve contribution margins as more volume moves into our capital-light marketplace. Second, we are seeing our contribution margin from partner-branded volume continue to be around 80% as we have built out the core infrastructure that powers Figure Connect and our partner-branded initiatives. And third, we continue to execute on operating leverage across both fixed and variable expense categories, where our volume increased 131% and our operating expenses, excluding share-based compensation, increased 13% over the same period.\"</p></blockquote> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation And Key Takeaways</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite its rapid growth opportunities, we find that Figure also remains attractively valued. For most of last year, Figure traded at unjustifiable multiples of its bottom line; and now, after its stock price sank, we can no longer say the same.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_e4a4aff10cc7806cfb789432fcda3d83.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_e4a4aff10cc7806cfb789432fcda3d83.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_e4a4aff10cc7806cfb789432fcda3d83.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_e4a4aff10cc7806cfb789432fcda3d83.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown above, Figure takes at roughly <strong>18x forward adjusted EBITDA. </strong>An exact peer set for Figure is tough since its business is so unique, but Figure trades in line with a number of adjacent peers. Coinbase (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COIN\" title=\"Coinbase Global, Inc.\">COIN</a>), which is the number-two crypto exchange, trades at similar ~17x adjusted EBITDA levels to Figure after its recent selloff. Another interesting direct competitor in home lending is legacy incumbent Rocket Mortgage (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RKT\" title=\"Rocket Companies, Inc.\">RKT</a>), which recently purchased Mr. Cooper and Redfin to become a one-stop shop consisting of a real estate brokerage, a mortgage originations platform, and a mortgage servicing arm. Against all of these peers, however, none can match Figure's ~2x y/y top-line growth and its incredible margin expansion trends.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stay long here and use the post-earnings dip as a buying opportunity.</p>",

You can see above that this represents a slight deceleration from the previous quarter but there is no question that their business as a whole continues to see strong momentum. <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_745481f08707ef4a10b5e2d007a99d6d/amd/db/841/9223/presentation/AMD+Q4%2725+Earnings+Slides+FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">AMD stated that they</a> saw strong demand in their Data Center and Client and Gaming segments. The company was also able to smash expectations. They <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD/earnings\">beat analyst consensus</a> by a whopping $599.73 million. With their quarterly revenue just above $10 billion, this is a huge statement of outperformance. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data Center Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772048985988_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"787\" data-height=\"428\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772048985988_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Data Center\" width=\"640\" height=\"348\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"348\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772048985988_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772048985988_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772048985988_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772048985988_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>AMD Q4 Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There's no question that the data center segment remains the point of focus in AMD's earnings. As shown above, they reported revenues of $5.4 billion and that was a 39% increase YoY. This is a sharp speedup of growth <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_745481f08707ef4a10b5e2d007a99d6d/amd/news/2025-11-04_AMD_Reports_Third_Quarter_2025_Financial_1265.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">from Q3's 22% growth rate</a> and so it seems this all-important business is gaining momentum. Despite worries about stiff competition from other GPU suppliers like Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) and ASICs designers like Broadcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>), AMD seems to be holding its ground nicely. At CES, the company also unveiled their state of the art Instinct MI440X and so it is clear that their innovation is doing the talking. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before this latest earnings season, there were concerns that the hyperscalers will cut back on CAPEX with the payoff from these investments still being rather obscure. However, these worries were proven to be unfounded just recently. In their latest earnings report earlier this month, Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) announced that<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4548486-amazon-shocked-wall-street-with-its-2026-spending-plan-which-companies-could-benefit\"> they will spend $200 billion</a>. This comes after Alphabet's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) estimate of $175 billion to $185 billion in capital spending for 2026 and so at this point, there really are no signs that the major cloud service providers are letting up on CAPEX. The competition in that space is fierce and for a GPU provider like AMD, the tailwinds are likely to be strong moving forward. In Q4, data center growth accelerated and there is no evidence that momentum will fade any time soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">International expansion is also top of mind for the company. By now it is no secret that India is becoming an increasingly vibrant center for AI development. About ten days ago, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4552263-amd-deepens-india-push-with-tcs-in-bid-to-rival-nvidia\">it was announced that</a> AMD and Tata Consultancy Services will broaden their strategic partnership. As Preeti Singh of Seeking Alpha writes, they will</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>introduce AMD’s “Helios” rack-scale AI architecture in India, stepping up competition with Nvidia in one of the world’s fastest-growing technology markets.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the U.S. is of course AMD's largest and most important market, the company's strategic decision to look to international markets like India for growth is a smart one in my view. The recent AI summit in the country clearly shows they are becoming an important source of infrastructure demand as well as innovation. As stated, this also helps them to compete with Nvidia globally. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, AMD made headlines with their massive Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) deal just yesterday (Feb 24th). <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4555727-amd-to-deploy-up-to-6-gw-of-ai-chips-for-metas-ai-infrastructure\">It was announced that</a> Meta will deploy up to 6 GW of Instinct chips to power their infrastructure and that this agreement is multiyear and multi-generation. Firstly, it is obvious that this is a major financial win for AMD. CFO Jean Hu stated that</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We expect this partnership to drive substantial multi-year revenue growth and be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings per share, marking another significant step forward in delivering on our ambitious long-term financial model.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Secondly, this is another major vote of confidence regarding the competitiveness of AMD's GPUs. As stated earlier, there were worries regarding stiff competition from Nvidia and Broadcom. I believe this massive Meta deal shows that AMD's solutions have matured and are now a formidable alternative to the top chips out there right now. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability Is Solid</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-17720505112657673_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1322\" data-height=\"655\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-17720505112657673_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Profitability\" width=\"640\" height=\"317\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"317\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-17720505112657673_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-17720505112657673_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-17720505112657673_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-17720505112657673_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>AMD Q4 Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q4, it seems that AMD has controlled costs well. You can see above that their adjusted gross margin expanded by 3 percentage points YoY. This could also be a signal of increased competitiveness in their products and thus better pricing power. Regardless of where this gross margin strength is coming from, investors should obviously be encouraged.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the control of expenses, things perhaps could have been a little bit better. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses increased by 1 percentage point YoY. If you go to their income statement, you'll see that marketing, general and administrative expenses growth outpaced the R&amp;D expense increase and so corporate efficiency may be slightly weaker than desired. Still, with the gross margin strength being a major driver, operating margin still saw expansion of 2 percentage points to show that AMD remains a generally well run business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, for the bottom line, the company posted an adjusted EPS of $1.53, up 40% YoY. This outpaced the top line growth rate and beat analyst expectations by $0.21 and so there really shouldn't be many complaints regarding their profitability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Quarterly Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772051236381334_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1164\" data-height=\"467\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772051236381334_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Outlook\" width=\"640\" height=\"257\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"257\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772051236381334_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772051236381334_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772051236381334_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57947294-1772051236381334_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>AMD Q4 Slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AMD provided guidance for their 2026 Q1. For revenue, they are expecting to see around $9.8 billion at the midpoint. This implies<a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_745481f08707ef4a10b5e2d007a99d6d/amd/news/2025-05-06_AMD_Reports_First_Quarter_2025_Financial_1247.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"> a YoY growth rate of 32%.</a> While that is another modest deceleration of growth from Q4 levels, I would say that this is still enough to show that business activity will remain robust for the company as a whole moving forward. Furthermore, it should be stated that they guided revenue ~$430 million <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4546578-earnings-snapshot-amd-posts-record-q4-results-beating-analysts-consensus\">above consensus expectations</a> and so the outlook looks quite good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For gross margin, they are projecting 55% and that would be an improvement from 54% in the year ago quarter. Therefore, the cost control and pricing power strength we talked about earlier is set to continue. Lastly, for operating expenses, they see around $3.05 billion for Q1. That represents a 38% jump. Since this outpaces the estimated top line growth rate, expect expense control to be mixed relatively speaking.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a whole, I view the near term outlook quite favorably, but investors should really focus even more on the increasingly strong long term growth story for their data center segment. Note on their earnings call, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4546760-amd-outlines-path-to-60-percent-annual-data-center-growth-and-multi-billion-ai-revenue-by\">CEO Lisa Su stated that </a></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We are well positioned to grow Data Center segment revenue by more than 60% annually over the next 3 to 5 years and scale our AI business to tens of billions in annual revenue in 2027.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_2b143adfada2d17de2a615bdf12c7f69.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_2b143adfada2d17de2a615bdf12c7f69.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_2b143adfada2d17de2a615bdf12c7f69.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_2b143adfada2d17de2a615bdf12c7f69.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AMD's forward P/E ratio has more than halved from the late 2025 peak. At a current reading of just 31.87, I believe the stock has reached bargain levels again. In today's article, it was shown that the company as a whole is performing well. In the in-depth look at their data center segment it was shown that growth is accelerating and recent developments are favorable. Hyperscalers are upping their spending, AMD's push into India is well justified, and the Meta deal is of course a big deal. No pun intended. With the near term outlook looking quite solid and long term tailwinds being strong, I view the company's fundamentals as robust and the prospects as being bright.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that in mind, the forward P/E ratio's rather sharp contraction over the past few months is really a sign of irrational worry and concern. AMD has the numbers, the contracts, and partnerships to show that they have become a force to be reckoned with instead of being a distant competitor to Nvidia and Broadcom. As a result, I view the current valuation as highly opportunistic.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are some risks that investors should have in mind. Firstly, by now it is no secret that the tech sector is feeling the effects of a memory chip shortage. Do note that while AMD's data center segment has taken virtually all the spotlight, the company also has a large Client and Gaming business. There are worries that the memory chip shortage could potentially weigh on PC sales and other consumer electronics. For AMD, since they do still have a good amount of exposure to this space, their company-wide financial performance may still be adversely effected even if their data center segment booms. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another potential risk <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4548407-intel-amd-notify-customers-in-china-of-lengthy-waits-for-cpus-reuters\">is CPU shortages</a> for the Chinese market. Earlier this month it was reported that both Intel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC\" title=\"Intel Corporation\">INTC</a>) and AMD had to notify Chinese customers that there were shortages and that deliveries had to be pushed back. For AMD specifically, delivery lead times for select products were pushed back 8 to 10 weeks. Obviously, this has the potential to have near term impacts to their business activity in one of the world's largest markets for CPUs. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in April of last year, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/bay-area-ideas/analysis?ticker=amd\">I called AMD stock a no-brainer.</a> I believe the company has earned that title back. In today's analysis, it was shown that they are seeing a great deal of momentum in their all-important data center segment. Growth is accelerating and new deals clearly show that they have become a true major GPU supplier instead of being just a challenger on the outside looking in. While the prospects are arguably as bright as ever, the valuation has more than halved since the peak in late 2025 and so the attractiveness of the stock has increased immensely despite the risks highlighted above. As a result, I have decided to upgrade AMD to a strong buy rating.</p>",

Since then, it has moved up 74%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My argument at that time was the company’s focus on green energy threatened profitability. I regard that as standing the test of time: Last year’s net profit was £1.3bn, a 45% decline from the equivalent number for 2021. Last year’s reported earnings per share of £1.08, a decline of 51%. The adjusted earnings per share last year showed growth versus 2021, though: you picks your reporting metric and you takes your choice…</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capital Expenditure Is Set to Remain High</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In November, the company published a <a href=\"https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/uk/scottish_southern_energy3/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=1&amp;newsid=2005630\" rel=\"nofollow\">strategic update</a> that, in the company’s words, would \"significantly increas(e) the Group's exposure to UK electricity Networks, and driv(e) long-term value creation with attractive regulated asset value and earnings growth.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This comes at a projected cost of £33bn (fully funded) over five years. Around four-fifths of that is to be spent on regulated UK electricity networks and the remainder on “Renewables and system Flexibilty” (SSE loves idiosyncratic use of uppercase letters).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That reflects a pragmatic shift in my view. The green push of some years ago has fallen out of fashion, explaining shifts in capital allocation priorities at firms including BP (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BP\" title=\"BP p.l.c.\">BP</a>), and I think SSE is also shifting its approach in this regard, something I see as positive for the investment case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But what about the expenditure? We have seen at other U.K. utilities such as National Grid (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NGG\" title=\"National Grid plc\">NGG</a>) that heavy network capex costs can lead to a dividend cut. In National Grid’s case, even after a rights issue and dividend cut, the net debt has continued to grow. As I explain below, SSE itself is no stranger to dividend cuts even before this latest spending plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of the £33bn, the firm reckons £21bn will come from operational cash flow. But the other £14bn is set to come from an “increase in adjusted net debt and hybrid capital.” The company didn’t bother defining “hybrid capital” in its release, although in its (long) “alternative performance measures” section in its most recent results, it says “Adjusted Net Debt and Hybrid Capital” equates most closely to the IFRS measure of “Unadjusted net debt.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Adjusted net debt and hybrid capital as of September 2025 stood at £11.4bn, so another £21bn is a substantial expansion, even over a five-year period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That strikes me as an unwelcome development for the balance sheet. On the plus side, the company reckons this will be transformative for earnings. It says, “investments made in Networks and selective Renewables and system Flexibility projects are expected to drive a step-up in earnings of around 50% over the plan, with an adjusted Earnings Per Share CAGR of between 7 - 9% delivering 225 - 250 pence in 2029/30”.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That certainly sounds impressive, but, first, I’d like to see it in practice rather than take it as given ahead of time, and, secondly, if earnings are set to grow significantly, why not fund the whole lot from operational cash flows? The answer, I presume, would be that the spend is presented on a five-year timeline, but the operational cashflow benefits should ultimately flow for much longer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, I think there is an element of “prove it” here before getting excited about this prospect. SSE’s capital allocation track record does not necessarily inspire confidence, while examples like National Grid point to the dangers of capex-heavy infrastructural spend adding to net debt and putting strain on dividend funding.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend is Not Compelling</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most recent interim dividend was raised by around 1%: not exciting at all compared to some U.K. utilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From 1999 to 2019 – a 20-year run – the company grew its dividend per share annually. It then cut it in 2020 by 18% and then cut it again in 2024, by 38%. That took it back to a level last seen in 2008-09.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720675674204302_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"977\" data-height=\"639\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720675674204302_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart compiled by author using data from company annual reports\" width=\"640\" height=\"419\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720675674204302_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720675674204302_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720675674204302_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720675674204302_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Chart compiled by author using data from company annual reports</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From 2023-24 to 2026-27, the company is targeting annual increases of 5-10%, which it says “aligns future dividends with SSE’s ambitious growth profile” (something not obvious from the past decade’s dividend history, in my view).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last year saw a 7% increase. The interim increase this year was therefore especially weak, but it could be made up for at the full-year level in order to deliver on the target.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, the dividend history is not reassuring at all when it comes to SSE’s commitment to the dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current yield of 2.5% is also underwhelming, not just for a utility stock but more generally given that even after falling due to a high price, the current FTSE 100 yield is 3.1%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">I Still See the Valuation as Too High</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since my sell piece in 2021, a 74% price gain has proven my approach wrong. Still, just as I thought the company was overpriced then, I still do today and maintain a sell rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a <a href=\"https://www.londonstockexchange.com/news-article/SSE/q3-trading-statement/17444982\" rel=\"nofollow\">trading statement</a> this month, the company said it expects adjusted earnings per share to be £1.44- £1.52. On an adjusted basis, that implies a prospective P/E ratio of around 17. Bear in mind that this is on an adjusted basis. First-half earnings per share (26.4p) were 27% lower than adjusted earnings per share for the period. Using that ratio as a proxy (a crude approach, but helpful to illustrate the point), then the prospective P/E ratio would be more like 23.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That to me looks overpriced.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What about using a cash flow-based valuation metric? The enterprise value is £42bn, based on £31bn of market cap plus this year’s interim point “net debt and hybrid capital” of £11bn (note: as the company says: ”reported net debt excludes equity classified hybrid capital, see Alternative Performance Measures section”). Last year, cash generated from operations was £2.6bn. So the ratio of enterprise value to cash generated from operations is 16. Again, that looks high to me.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SSE is solidly profitable, and its new five-year strategy ought to embed it yet further in an area of the U.K. economy that benefits from long-term demand and visibility of pricing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I also see some disadvantages to its business model, and despite a rising share price, I think the direction of travel on dividends over the past couple of decades shows a business that has become less, not more, able to create shareholder value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At its current price, I continue to see it as overvalued and therefore unattractive from an investment perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It will be worth monitoring how the current strategic plan starts to feed into the business, not only in terms of profit but also the balance sheet and whether the expected costs remain the same or rise over the course of the five-year plan.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Rodriguez/Getty Images Entertainment</p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"inline_ad_placeholder\"></div> <h2>A Quarter with Mixed Developments</h2> <p>The Honest Company (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HNST\" title=\"The Honest Company, Inc.\">HNST</a></span>) reported Q4 2025 results on February 25, 2026, highlighting balance sheet strength and early traction in its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4844205-the-honest-company-stock-reducing-complexity\">transformation</a> while setting expectations for 2026. Some<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> developments were clearly positive. Others indicate that progress may materialize at a more gradual pace. I focus my analysis on organic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, as these are the metrics that allow for an apple-to-apple comparison as the company executes on its transformation strategy. Below are the key developments and my assessment for them.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>1. Enhanced Cash Levels</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was the highlight of the quarter, as the cash balance expanded from $71 million in Q3 2025 to $90 million in Q4 2025. For a quarter where the company exited multiple channels and categories, this growth in cash levels is quite notable. Moreover, HNST is a debt-free company, and cash accounts for 35% of its market capitalization as of the close on February 25, 2026.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>2. The First Share Repurchase Program</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the company’s strong balance sheet, it <a href=\"https://investors.honest.com/news-releases/news-release-details/honest-company-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced a share repurchase program of $25 million</a>. During the conference call, management highlighted that they view the company’s valuation as low and that they intend to repurchase shares opportunistically. This is a good development and will likely act as a catalyst for the share price in the near term.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>3. Results Were Within Guidance Range</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For FY2025, HNST posted a 5.3% increase in organic revenue, which was in the mid-range of its 4% to 6% growth guidance. FY2025 adjusted EBITDA was $21.8 million and was in the bottom half of the guidance range of $21 million to $23 million. Though this does not qualify as a bad outcome, it suggests that growth will take time despite the pivot to better-performing categories.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>4. FY2026 Guidance Is Somewhat Underwhelming</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is guiding for organic revenue growth of 4% to 6% (Figure 1). It is also guiding to adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 70 to 150 basis points. Given that the company is dropping roughly a fifth of its revenue base to focus on categories with better prospects and profitability, this guidance appears soft. I view the guidance as conservative and likely to be revised upward as the year progresses.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>5. Accelerate Beyond Baby</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is focusing more on households without babies. This entails expanding into personal care products catered to kids and widening the wipes offering to better serve adults. These product extensions represent a natural evolution of the core product line, making it a low hanging fruit.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>6. Improved Inventory Management</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company aims to transition from two warehouses to a single location. This optimization project is expected to be operational in 2H2026. Management seems to be very optimistic about this project and the efficiencies that it expects to extract out of it.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>7. Diapers Likely to Remain Challenged In 20226 </strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Diapers account for around 30% of HNST sales and have seen significant headwinds in 2025. There is a trend of consumers moving towards lower-priced items due to economic pressures. This is a major problem for HNST, as its diaper offering is positioned as a premium offering. Also, there was an issue with Target (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT\" title=\"Target Corporation\">TGT</a>), where the company had to simplify its product offering. The issue with Target is behind us, but the macro headwind remains in play. The category is likely to register flat to negative growth in 2026. This would explain the soft growth in organic sales guidance, as the company’s second largest category remains pressured.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Figure 1: FY2026 Management Guidance</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720788702944093.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Forecast\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"510\" height=\"319\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720788702944093.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720788702944093.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720788702944093.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Compiled by Author using data from the company</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Share Price</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The share price of HNST has been on major correction for the past twelve months. The stock has fallen by 58.5% during this period and currently trades very close to its 52-week low. Is the stock ready to switch gears and start climbing upwards? Well, the transformation resulted in a reported net loss of $23.6 million, but that was mostly write-downs that did not impact the company’s fundamentals. As discussed earlier, the company was able to enhance its cash position, as it benefited from a favorable working capital movement as it exited some product categories and channels. The announcement of the first share buyback program is likely to install confidence among investors that bad times are behind us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Figure 2: HNST Share Price</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720789145119288_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1959\" data-height=\"738\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720789145119288_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Share price\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"241\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720789145119288_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720789145119288_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720789145119288_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720789145119288_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">HNST is trading at an EV-to-Sales (Forward) of 0.57x based on the midpoint of management’s sales guidance for FY2026. This is well below the consumer staples sector median of 1.52x. This shows that the stock has a lot of scope to rerate upwards once investors start believing that the transformation is on the right track. Thus, I share the same view as management that the current share price valuation does not reflect the structural improvement that is taking hold.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Macro headwinds and tariffs are the key risks facing HNST. The weak macro conditions facing consumers were heavily emphasized by management in the Q4 2025 earnings call. Given that HNST products sell at more premium pricing, the company could face slower sales than anticipated. Consumers could downshift to save money, and this leaves the diapers category the most exposed. Tariffs have increased product costs and will remain a headwind until Q2 2026. Also, the company is in the midst of a transformation process, and there are no guarantees that this plan would work.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that HNST posted results with more positives than negatives. Importantly, the balance sheet strengthened during a turnaround quarter. The company is guiding for improved adjusted EBITDA margin driven by a more favorable sales mix. The company is competing in categories where it has a strong value proposition and is looking to solidify its position. Given its low valuation, the stock appears positioned for a potential rebound. I maintain my Bbuyrating on the shares.</p>",

Instead, positioning is driven by a bottom-up stock selection process based on our estimate of intrinsic value, which is based on a company's future cash flows.</li> <li>We seek to create wealth by maintaining a long-term investment horizon and by investing in companies that we believe are significantly undervalued on an absolute basis.</li> <li>Given our focus on intrinsic value and our long-term investment horizon, at quarter end, the fund was positioned with greater exposure to economically sensitive stocks compared to its peers.</li> <li>Following the outperformance of large-cap stocks over small-cap stocks in recent years, we see greater long-term upside to intrinsic value in many small-caps compared to large-caps.</li> <li>At quarter end, the difference between the market prices of the fund's holdings and our estimates of their intrinsic value was attractive, in our view.</li> <li>Although there is no assurance that market value will ever reflect our estimate of the fund's intrinsic value, we believe the gap between price and estimated intrinsic value indicated attractive long-term capital appreciation potential.</li> </ul> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top issuers (% of total market value)</h4> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th> </th> <th>Fund</th> <th>Index</th> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>Coherent Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COHR\" title=\"Coherent Corp.\">COHR</a>)</td> <td>3.78</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Western Alliance Bancorp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WAL\" title=\"Western Alliance Bancorporation\">WAL</a>)</td> <td>2.75</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>MKS Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MKSI\" title=\"MKS Inc.\">MKSI</a>)</td> <td>2.60</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hudbay Minerals Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HBM\" title=\"Hudbay Minerals Inc.\">HBM</a>)</td> <td>2.23</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Globe Life Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GL\" title=\"Globe Life Inc.\">GL</a>)</td> <td>2.22</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Charles River Laboratories International Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRL\" title=\"Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\">CRL</a>)</td> <td>2.20</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>NRG Energy Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NRG\" title=\"NRG Energy, Inc.\">NRG</a>)</td> <td>2.02</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Expedia Group Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXPE\" title=\"Expedia Group, Inc.\">EXPE</a>)</td> <td>2.00</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Webster Financial Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBS\" title=\"Webster Financial Corporation\">WBS</a>)</td> <td>1.96</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Saia Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAIA\" title=\"Saia, Inc.\">SAIA</a>)</td> <td>1.93</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>As of 12/31/25.

This volatility provided an opportunity for us to purchase stocks with what we saw as attractive long-term upside to intrinsic value across a diverse set of industries. At quarter end, the fund had overweights in more economically sensitive stocks than its benchmark and peers.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notable Additions:</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Charles River Laboratories: This leading contract research organization ('CRO') supports the discovery, development and safe manufacture of new drugs, biologics, vaccines and medical devices. It has a diversified portfolio with exposure to high growth therapeutic areas. Slower spending on biotech and pharma research and development has been a headwind to the stock, which gave us an opportunity to invest at what we saw as an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Globus Medical (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GMED\" title=\"Globus Medical, Inc.\">GMED</a>): This medical technology company specializes in musculoskeletal solutions for spine, orthopedic trauma and joint reconstruction. The company has faced issues with recent acquisitions, supply chain issues and weakness in its robotics segment, which together provided an opportunity to purchase the stock at what we saw as an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ArcBest (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARCB\" title=\"ArcBest Corporation\">ARCB</a>): This logistics and freight transportation company operates less-than-truckload ('LTL') shipping, which is used for shipments too large for parcel delivery but too small for a full truckload. The trucking industry has been in a multi-year cyclical downturn; however, we believe ArcBest's operational efficiency and technological advancements using artificial intelligence ('AI') should position the company well once demand recovers.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notable Sales:</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart Industries (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GTLS\" title=\"Chart Industries, Inc.\">GTLS</a>): A global leader in cryogenic and gas-handling technologies, the company provides highly engineered equipment to support a wide range of industries, with a focus on clean energy and industrial gas solutions. The company is being acquired by Baker Hughes (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BKR\" title=\"Baker Hughes Company\">BKR</a>) (not a fund holding) in an all-cash transaction expected to close in mid-2026. We opted to sell the stock to fund other opportunities we believe have better upside to intrinsic value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mastec (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTZ\" title=\"MasTec, Inc.\">MTZ</a>): An infrastructure contractor, delivering critical services across communications, energy, power and water systems, Mastec is involved with the AI infrastructure build-out for fiber networks and data centers. The stock rose in the fourth quarter, which gave us an opportunity to sell the position to fund opportunities we believe have more upside to intrinsic value.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sector breakdown (% of total market value)</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">■ Fund ■ Russell 2000 Value Index ('USD')</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/542689-17721607660364835_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"671\" data-height=\"786\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/542689-17721607660364835_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Horizontal bar chart comparing Fund and Russell 2000 Value Index (&lt;a href='https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USD' title='ProShares Ultra Semiconductors ETF'&gt;USD&lt;/a&gt;) sector breakdowns.

Overall, performance drivers were largely stock specific.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Contributors to performance</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lumentum: Shares of this market-leading designer and manufacturer of innovative optical and photonic products rallied in the fourth quarter, fueled by apparent investor enthusiasm for its AI-driven growth potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Globus Medical: The orthopedic device maker reported better-than-expected financial results with strong organic growth and an increase in its forward earnings guidance. The company's recent acquisitions are expected to provide synergies that we believe should boost earnings in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Coherent: This laser company develops and manufactures optoelectronic components and devices. Its optical transceivers are key enablers for networking of AI servers. Shares rose due to surging AI data center demand, strong growth of networking revenue and expanding profit margins supported by a more focused, high-return product portfolio.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Detractors from performance</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AECOM: AECOM is a global infrastructure consulting and engineering firm that provides planning, design, construction and management for transportation, water, environmental, energy and building projects worldwide. The company reported better-than-expected earnings, but revenues were below expectations, driving the stock lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Crane NXT: This industrial technology company provides technological solutions to secure, detect and authenticate physical and digital assets. Shares declined amid reignited trade tensions with China. Though the company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue growth, management reduced its earnings outlook for the full year, which also sent shares lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PENN Entertainment: The company operates physical casinos in the US, along with a growing digital gaming and sports-betting platform. Shares declined after third quarter earnings missed expectations. The company's announcement ending its partnership with ESPN also seemed to dampen investor sentiment.</p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">References</h4> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Alpha (cash adjusted) is a measure of performance on a risk-adjusted basis. Beta (cash adjusted) is a measure of relative risk and the slope of regression. Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated using standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance. Information Ratio is a measurement of portfolio returns beyond the returns of a benchmark, usually an index, compared to the volatility of those returns. Standard deviation measures a fund's range of total returns and identifies the spread of a fund's short-term fluctuations. Tracking Error is defined as the expected standard deviation of a portfolio's excess return over the benchmark index return. The up and down capture measures how well a manager was able to replicate or improve on periods of positive benchmark returns and how severely the manager was affected by periods of negative benchmark returns. Maximum Drawdown is the maximum observed loss from a high to a low of a portfolio, before a new high is attained. Maximum drawdown is an indicator of downside risk over a specified time period. Weighted Average Market Cap is a measure of the average size of company held in a portfolio. The percentage of the portfolio invested each company, or its weight, is multiplied by its size (market capitalization). An average of the weighted size of all companies held is then calculated. Price/earnings measures the price per share relative to the earnings per share of the company while excluding extraordinary items. Price to book measures the firm's capitalization (market price) to book value. Est. 3-5 year EPS (Earning per share) growth measures the earning per share growth from FY3 to FY5. ROE is the Return on Equity that measures the fund's annual return relative to total shareholders' equity. This ratio evaluates how quickly investments can be turned into profits. Long-term debt to capital measures a fund's financial leverage by calculating the proportion of long-term debt used to finance its assets relative to the amount of equity used for the same purpose. A higher ratio indicates higher leverage. Operating margin measures the profit a fund makes for every dollar of sales after paying the variable expenses. Contribution to Return measures the performance impact from portfolio holdings over a defined time period. It takes into account both weight and performance of the portfolio holdings. Contribution to Return is calculated at security level.</li></ol> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p>Investment objective</p> <p>The fund seeks long-term growth of capital.</p> <p>Fund facts</p> <p>Fund AUM ($M) 8,173.74</p> <p>Portfolio managers</p> <p>Jonathan Edwards, Jonathan Mueller</p> <p> </p> <p>Standardized performance (%) as of December 31, 2025</p> <div class=\"table-responsive\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th> </th> <th> </th> <th>Quarter</th> <th>YTD</th> <th>1 Year</th> <th>3 Years</th> <th>5 Years</th> <th>10 Years</th> <th>Since Inception</th> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>Class A shares inception: 06/21/99</td> <td>NAV</td> <td>6.79</td> <td>17.64</td> <td>17.64</td> <td>21.66</td> <td>20.72</td> <td>14.64</td> <td>11.91</td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td>Max.

Attribution methodology notes: The attribution provides analysis of the effects of several portfolio management decisions, including allocation and security selection. Securities classified as \"Other\" may include non-equity securities, derivatives, and securities for which a sector classification may not be appropriate. The portfolio is actively managed and portfolio holdings are subject to change. The percentage weights represented for the portfolio are dollar weighted based on market value. Market allocation effect shows the excess contribution due to sector/market allocation. A positive allocation effect implies that the choice of sector weights in the portfolio added value to the portfolio contribution with respect to the benchmark and vice versa. Selection effect shows the excess contribution due to security selection. A positive selection effect implies that the choice of stocks in the portfolio added value to the portfolio contribution with respect to the benchmark and vice versa. Total effect is the difference in contribution between the benchmark and portfolio.

Beta (cash adjusted) is a measure of relative risk and the slope of regression. Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated using standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance. Information Ratio is a measurement of portfolio returns beyond the returns of a benchmark, usually an index, compared to the volatility of those returns. Standard deviation measures a fund's range of total returns and identifies the spread of a fund's short-term fluctuations. Tracking Error is defined as the expected standard deviation of a portfolio's excess return over the benchmark index return. The up and down capture measures how well a manager was able to replicate or improve on periods of positive benchmark returns and how severely the manager was affected by periods of negative benchmark returns. Maximum Drawdown is the maximum observed loss from a high to a low of a portfolio, before a new high is attained. Maximum drawdown is an indicator of downside risk over a specified time period. Weighted Average Market Cap is a measure of the average size of company held in a portfolio. The percentage of the portfolio invested each company, or its weight, is multiplied by its size (market capitalization). An average of the weighted size of all companies held is then calculated. Price/earnings measures the price per share relative to the earnings per share of the company while excluding extraordinary items. Price to book measures the firm's capitalization (market price) to book value. Est. 3-5 year EPS (Earning per share) growth measures the earning per share growth from FY3 to FY5. ROE is the Return on Equity that measures the fund's annual return relative to total shareholders' equity. This ratio evaluates how quickly investments can be turned into profits. Long-term debt to capital measures a fund's financial leverage by calculating the proportion of long-term debt used to finance its assets relative to the amount of equity used for the same purpose. A higher ratio indicates higher leverage. Operating margin measures the profit a fund makes for every dollar of sales after paying the variable expenses. Contribution to Return measures the performance impact from portfolio holdings over a defined time period. It takes into account both weight and performance of the portfolio holdings. Contribution to Return is calculated at security level.</p> <hr> <p>Morningstar</p> <p>Source: ©2025 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved.

UK Gilts and U.S. Treasuries outperformed, while yields rose (prices fell) in Europe and Japan. U.S. Treasuries bull-steepened, with front-end rates falling over the quarter.</li> <li>The Federal Reserve (Fed) cut interest rates twice over the quarter by a combined 50 basis points ('bps') to 3.75% in response to a weaker jobs market, with the U.S. unemployment rate hitting a four-year high of 4.6% in November.</li> <li>Other data releases were more positive, with U.S. inflation dipping below expectations in November and third-quarter (gross domestic product) GDP growth that surprised on the upside. Despite policymakers indicating, in aggregate, that they anticipate one more cut in 2026, futures markets are pricing in an additional two cuts next year.</li> <li>In the UK, the Bank of England (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BOE\" title=\"BlackRock Enhanced Global Dividend Trust\">BOE</a>) lowered its policy rate by 25 bps in a split 5-4 vote, with policymakers citing subdued growth and easing inflation pressures. The UK's Consumer Price Index ('CPI') eased to 3.2% in November, from 3.6% in October, below the 3.5% forecast and marking the lowest level since March. The Autumn Budget revealed a surprise £22 billion of fiscal headroom (versus the expected £9 billion), achieved through front-loaded spending and upbeat revenue forecasts ahead of the 2026 general election.</li> <li>December brought another wave of bond selling across Europe, fueled by rising expectations of a European Central Bank ('ECB') rate increase in 2026. The shift in sentiment followed Isabel Schnabel's remarks in a Bloomberg interview, where she said she was \"rather comfortable\" with the idea that the next policy move could be a hike. The Governing Council subsequently nudged its 2026 growth and inflation forecasts higher. In France, political uncertainty lingered as the government failed to pass a full state budget, relying instead on a stopgap measure to avoid a shutdown.</li> <li>Another key development in the quarter came from Japan, where Sanae Takaichi won the Liberal Democratic Party ('LDP') leadership race in October and was appointed prime minister later that month. Her victory took markets by surprise. In addition, the government unveiled a substantial fiscal stimulus package in November.</li> <li>The Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised its policy rate by 25 bps, to 0.75%, the highest level in 30 years, while signaling openness to further hikes. The 10-year Japanese Government Bond ('JGB') yield climbed above 2.0% following the BoJ decision, reaching its highest level since 1999.</li> <li>In credit markets, October was a big month of issuance in U.S. investment-grade bonds, which saw record October supply of $158 billion. Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) priced $30 billion of debt. This was followed by another major supply event from Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) in early November. Bond issuance to fund the artificial intelligence ('AI') capital expenditure (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAPEX\" title=\"Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Growth Fund 1.0\">CAPEX</a>) of hyperscalers is now a dominant theme.</li> </ul> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Public credit markets remained supported by formidably strong investor demand, driven by high all-in yields and low default rates. However, the credit market continued to be selective. CCC rated corporate bonds in the U.S. and Europe underperformed over the quarter. Investors are showing caution and avoiding capital structures that are most at risk of restructuring.</li></ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main positive contributor to fund performance was the overweight position to corporate bonds and bank loans, which benefited from income and spread compression.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the credit side, we actively participated in several new issues in the U.S., Europe, and the UK, while switching out of bonds that had performed strongly, which in our view had become highly valued relative to their fundamentals, to generate liquidity. We bought bonds of from AA rated tech issuers such as Google, well-capitalized banks, and insurers where spreads were appealing. These were new or increased positions in subordinated debt of these institutions, at yields in the 5.5% to 7% range. We continue to find the backdrop more conducive to taking credit risk rather than duration risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to the credit holdings, we retain a long position in high-yield credit derivatives ('CDX'), which was accretive for the yield of the portfolio. Our yield curve positioning detracted during the quarter.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Manager outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We maintain a constructive outlook for the global economy heading into 2026. Signs point to a soft-landing scenario: inflation has cooled considerably without a recession, and underlying growth remains resilient across major regions. The U.S. economy demonstrated positive momentum – third-quarter GDP surprised to the upside at 4.3%. Europe's growth outlook has improved from mid-year doldrums; lower energy costs and a weaker euro should spur some pick-up, albeit growth likely will be moderate (approximately 1% in 2026). China's stimulus measures into 2026 may also stabilize global demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Developed World Bond Fund (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HFAAX\" title=\"Janus Henderson Developed World Bond Fund A\">HFAAX</a></span>)</p> <p>A: (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HFAAX\" title=\"Janus Henderson Developed World Bond Fund A\">HFAAX</a>) C: (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HFACX\" title=\"Janus Henderson Developed World Bond Fund C\">HFACX</a></span>) I: (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HFAIX\" title=\"Janus Henderson Developed World Bond Fund I\">HFAIX</a></span>) N: (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HFARX\" title=\"Janus Henderson Developed World Bond Fund N\">HFARX</a></span>) S: (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HFASX\" title=\"Janus Henderson Developed World Bond Fund S\">HFASX</a></span>) T: (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HFATX\" title=\"Janus Henderson Developed World Bond Fund T\">HFATX</a></span>)</p> <p></p> <p>Portfolio management</p> <p>Jenna Barnard, CFA</p> <p>Nicholas Ware</p> <p>Developed World Bond Fund (as of 12/31/25) Performance – USD (%)</p> <div class=\"table-responsive\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Returns</th> <th>Cumulative</th> <th>Annualized</th> <th>Since Inception</th> </tr> <tr> <th>4Q25</th> <th>YTD</th> <th>1 Yr</th> <th>3 Yr</th> <th>5 Yr</th> <th>10 Yr</th> <th>(09/30/03)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Class I Shares</td> <td>1.04</td> <td>6.48</td> <td>6.48</td> <td>4.72</td> <td>-0.96</td> <td>2.63</td> <td>4.05</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Class T Shares</td> <td>0.98</td> <td>6.29</td> <td>6.29</td> <td>4.46</td> <td>-1.19</td> <td>2.41</td> <td>3.90</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Class N Shares</td> <td>1.04</td> <td>6.56</td> <td>6.56</td> <td>4.72</td> <td>-0.95</td> <td>2.66</td> <td>4.01</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Class A Shares @ NAV</td> <td>0.99</td> <td>6.29</td> <td>6.29</td> <td>4.51</td> <td>-1.17</td> <td>2.40</td> <td>3.89</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Class A Shares @ MOP</td> <td>-3.81</td> <td>1.24</td> <td>1.24</td> <td>2.83</td> <td>-2.13</td> <td>1.90</td> <td>3.66</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Bloomberg Global Aggregate Credit Index</td> <td>0.94</td> <td>6.80</td> <td>6.80</td> <td>6.31</td> <td>0.41</td> <td>3.15</td> <td>3.92</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p>Returns quoted are past performance and do not guarantee future results; current performance may be lower or higher.

Attribution is calculated using gross returns before the deduction of advisory fees and considers differences in weighting for the portfolio and the index. This analysis aims to break down the portfolio's performance into different components to understand what factors contributed to relative return, among other performance characteristics. The analysis can provide insights into which decisions positively or negatively impacted the portfolio's performance and serves as the basis for this discussion.</p> <p>There is no assurance the stated objective(s) will be met.</p> <p>Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal and fluctuation of value.</p> <p>Foreign securities are subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations, political and economic uncertainty, increased volatility, lower liquidity and differing financial and information reporting standards, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.</p> <p>Fixed income securities are subject to interest rate, inflation, credit and default risk. The bond market is volatile. As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. The return of principal is not guaranteed, and prices may decline if an issuer fails to make timely payments or its credit strength weakens.</p> <p>Mortgage-backed securities ('MBS') may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. They are subject to extension risk, where borrowers extend the duration of their mortgages as interest rates rise, and prepayment risk, where borrowers pay off their mortgages earlier as interest rates fall. These risks may reduce returns.</p> <p>High-yield or \"junk\" bonds involve a greater risk of default and price volatility and can experience sudden and sharp price swings.</p> <p>Derivatives can be more volatile and sensitive to economic or market changes than other investments, which could result in losses exceeding the original investment and magnified by leverage.</p> <p>Industry and Sector Risk. Investing a significant portion of its assets in companies in the same industry or economic sector can make the Fund more vulnerable to unfavorable developments than funds that invest more broadly. A more concentrated portfolio can be susceptible to factors affecting that group and may be more volatile than less concentrated investments or the market as a whole.</p> <p>ESG Investment Risk: Because it considers environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG\") factors in selecting securities, the Fund may perform differently from funds that do not. ESG considerations and exclusionary criteria may limit investments in certain industries or sectors, and the Fund's performance might vary from similar funds that do not formally consider ESG factors. Information from issuers and third parties on ESG considerations, which management may use, is evolving and may be incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistently applied across issuers and industries. The risk that the Fund may be required to sell securities when it might be otherwise disadvantageous to do so is heightened when ESG considerations and exclusionary criteria are applied.</p> <p>ESG Integration: As part of its investment process, portfolio management evaluates ESG risks and opportunities (\"ESG Factors\") deemed financially material, alongside other investment factors. ESG Factors are among many considerations in investment decisions and may not solely determine portfolio inclusion or exclusion.</p> <p>Bloomberg Global Aggregate Credit Index measures the credit sector of the global investment grade fixed-rate bond market, including corporate, government and agency securities.

We'll note that longer-term performance comparisons favor the fund over the benchmark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">U.S. small-cap stocks posted a gain in the fourth quarter, according to the benchmark, extending a rebound that began in early April, but at a slower pace. The advance was supported by strong corporate fundamentals, a resilient economy, an ongoing boom in spending on artificial intelligence and the Federal Reserve's first interest-rate reductions since December 2024. Within the Russell 2000® Index, small-cap value stocks (+3.26%) modestly outpaced small-cap growth (+1.22%) in Q4. Large-caps, as represented by the Russell Top 200 Index (+2.99%), had a slight advantage over small-caps in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Only three of 11 sectors outpaced the small-cap-oriented Russell 2000® Index. Health care (+19%) had the strongest outcome and particularly shined in November. Materials (+5%) also posted a solid gain, while the growth-oriented communication services sector rose about 4%, benefiting from the transformative potential of generative AI. Conversely, the defensive-oriented consumer staples sector (-5%) lagged, as did information technology (-5%) consumer discretionary (-4%) and industrials (-2%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Industry positioning detracted from the fund's performance versus the benchmark, especially in health care. A non-benchmark position in industrial technology company Crane NXT (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CXT\" title=\"Crane NXT, Co.\">CXT</a>) (-30%) was the largest individual relative detractor. Shares of Crane NXT hit an all-time high in October. However, as the Trump administration threatened to levy steep trade tariffs on Chinese imports, reigniting fears of a trade war, shares of Crane NXT slid downward through year end. Aggressive U.S. trade policies threatened many companies exposed to the industrials sector, as costs become unpredictable and can disrupt manufacturing operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In contrast, a non-benchmark stake in micro-chip manufacturer Micron Technology (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU\" title=\"Micron Technology, Inc.\">MU</a>) (+72%) was the top individual relative contributor. Shares of the company have soared since hitting a low on April 4, 2025. The company is only one of three that specialize in high-bandwidth memory, which is increasingly in demand as technology driven by artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent. During the past year, Micron Technology's revenue, as well as its cash flow, have dramatically increased due in large part to brisk demand for its chips. As Micron Technology's stock approached our target valuation this quarter, we trimmed the fund's position to invest in other investment opportunities. </p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio Positioning and Market Outlook</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund's positioning among sectors remained largely unchanged the past three months, as we made only modest shifts based on where we found the best potential risk-adjusted returns and opportunistic ideas that fit our investment philosophy. Our investment process centers on being patient, taking a long-term view and comparing price to value with the hope of choosing undiscovered gems. When we evaluate a stock, we typically think about owning it for three to five years, looking past short-term noise and focusing on key fundamental drivers over a multiyear period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As 2026 begins, we continue to find many investments outside the U.S. to be attractive, given the valuation gap that exists following an extended period of significant U.S. equity outperformance. That said, in the U.S., we are finding some interesting opportunities in areas where prices have been dislocated due to revised tariffs and tariff policy uncertainty. We are focusing on companies that we believe will successfully adapt to a \"new normal,\" and where the market is pricing in a much more pessimistic outlook. In addition to identifying companies that don't trade at an excessive valuation, we seek those that consistently generate positive cash flow. When the market is narrow and favors only a few winners, we believe it helps us find compelling ideas that are overlooked, and thus provides opportunity for investment. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">References</h4> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Life of Fund ('LOF') if performance is less than 10 years.

It focuses mostly on small- and mid-cap companies, including overseas. Most holdings have share prices below $35 per share or an earnings yield at or above the median for the Russell 2000® Index. (The earnings yield is the inverse of the price-earnings (P/E) ratio; a high earnings yield means a low P/E ratio.)</p> <p>Our investment process is based on the belief that many low-priced stocks are mispriced. Mispricings are especially likely to occur in businesses that seem boring and out of favor or which require careful analysis.</p> <p>We seek to buy higher-quality companies with stable growth prospects that trade at a discount to our estimate of intrinsic (fair) value.</p> <p>Where the gap between price and value is especially compelling, we may invest in firms whose near-term prospects appear challenged. We cast a wide net, and many holdings are outside of the fund's benchmark.</p> <p>We invest with a long-term time horizon and global perspective, seeking to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns. To help manage risk, we look for understandable businesses that are resilient and growing, with honest and capable management, purchased at a modest price.</p> <p>Performance Summary</p> <div class=\"table-responsive\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead> <tr> <th></th> <th>Cumulative</th> <th>Annualized</th> </tr> <tr> <th>3 Month</th> <th>YTD</th> <th>1 Year</th> <th>3 Year</th> <th>5 Year</th> <th>10 Year/ LOF 1</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund</td> <td>1.64%</td> <td>14.77%</td> <td>14.77%</td> <td>12.02%</td> <td>10.52%</td> <td>10.25%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gross Expense Ratio: 0.87% 2</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Russell 2000 Index</td> <td>2.19%</td> <td>12.81%</td> <td>12.81%</td> <td>13.73%</td> <td>6.09%</td> <td>9.62%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Morningstar Fund Global Small/Mid Stock</td> <td>0.97%</td> <td>16.34%</td> <td>16.34%</td> <td>10.19%</td> <td>2.88%</td> <td>7.34%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>% Rank in Morningstar Category (1% = Best)</td> <td>--</td> <td>--</td> <td>47%</td> <td>42%</td> <td>12%</td> <td>8%</td> </tr> <tr> <td># of Funds in Morningstar Category</td> <td>--</td> <td>--</td> <td>177</td> <td>166</td> <td>150</td> <td>90</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p>1 Life of Fund ('LOF') if performance is less than 10 years.

Preferred stock is included as part of each company's net worth.</p> <p>Sales-Per-Share Growth measures the growth in reported sales over the specified past time period.</p> <p>Weighted Average Market Cap identifies the market capitalization of the average equity holding as determined by the dollars invested in the portfolio or benchmark.</p> <p>Weighted Median Market Cap identifies the market capitalization of the median equity holding as determined by the dollars invested in the portfolio or benchmark.</p> <p>Important Fund Information</p> <p>Relative positioning data presented in this commentary is based on the fund's primary benchmark (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INDEX\" title=\"Cyber Hornet S&amp;P 500 No Load\">INDEX</a>) unless a secondary benchmark is provided to assess performance.</p> <p>Indices</p> <p>It is not possible to invest directly in an index. All indices represented are unmanaged. All indices include reinvestment of dividends and interest income unless otherwise noted.</p> <p>Russell 2000 Index is a market capitalization-weighted index designed to measure the performance of the small-cap segment of the U.S. equity market. It includes approximately 2,000 of the smallest securities in the Russell 3000 Index.</p> <p>Market-segment Weights</p> <p>Market-segment weights illustrate examples of sectors or industries in which the fund may invest, and may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. They should not be construed or used as a recommendation for any sector or industry.</p> <p>Ranking Information</p> <p>© 2026 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved.

Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for mutual fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.</p> <p>% Rank in Morningstar Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category. The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1%. % Rank in Morningstar Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges. Multiple share classes of a fund have a common portfolio but impose different expense structures.</p> <p>Relative Weights</p> <p>Relative weights represents the % of fund assets in a particular market segment, asset class or credit quality relative to the benchmark. A positive number represents an overweight, and a negative number is an underweight. The fund's benchmark is listed immediately under the fund name in the Performance Summary.</p> <p>3-Year Risk/return Statistics</p> <p>Beta is a measure of the volatility of a fund relative to its benchmark index. A beta greater (le<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/S\" title=\"SentinelOne, Inc.\">S</a>s) than 1 is more (le<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/S\" title=\"SentinelOne, Inc.\">S</a>s) volatile than the index.</p> <p>Information Ratio measures a fund's active return (fund's average monthly return minus the benchmark's average monthly return) in relation to the volatility of its active returns.</p> <p>R-Squared measures how a fund's performance correlates with a benchmark index's performance and shows what portion of it can be explained by the performance of the overall market/index. R-Squared ranges from 0, meaning no correlation, to 1, meaning perfect correlation. An R-Squared value of less than 0.5 indicates that annualized alpha and beta are not reliable performance statistics.</p> <p>Sharpe Ratio is a measure of historical risk-adjusted performance. It is calculated by dividing the fund's excess returns (the fund's average annual return for the period minus the 3-month \"risk free\" return rate) and dividing it by the standard deviation of the fund's returns. The higher the ratio, the better the fund's return per unit of risk. The three month \"risk free\" rate used is the 90-day Treasury Bill rate.</p> <p>Standard Deviation is a statistical measurement of the dispersion of a fund's return over a specified time period. Fidelity calculates standard deviations by comparing a fund's monthly returns to its average monthly return over a 36-month period, and then annualizes the number. Investors may examine historical standard deviation in conjunction with historical returns to decide whether a fund's volatility would have been acceptable given the returns it would have produced. A higher standard deviation indicates a wider dispersion of past returns and thus greater historical volatility. Standard deviation does not indicate how the fund actually performed, but merely indicates the volatility of its returns over time.</p> <p>Tracking Error is the divergence between the price behavior of a position or a portfolio and the price behavior of a benchmark, creating an unexpected profit or loss.</p> <p><em>Before investing in any mutual fund, please carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses.
