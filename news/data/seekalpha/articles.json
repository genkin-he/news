Well, joining us now to discuss is Michael Brown. He's Vice President, Director, and Portfolio Manager with TD Asset Management.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Michael, great to have you back on the show.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Thank you for having me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Alright, so we've heard that the US Supreme Court has struck down some of those tariffs, and that Washington responded by enacting a new 10% global tariff. So, what does that mean for Europe and Asia going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Well, firstly, 10% is better than the 15% he talked on the weekend. I mean, right now, it would be modestly positive. I mean, uncertainty still continues with the tariffs, particularly in Asia, countries like China and India. This is a significant, at least temporary, reduction in the tariffs they're paying.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But I mean, the outlook is, as we all know, this administration has talked quite regularly about tariffs being part of their policy agenda, and so, they will likely find another way to bring them into the discussions. But it is a temporary reprieve for particularly China and India as it drops to 10%. Other uncertainty would be for countries like Japan and Korea, who have made tentative deals. What happens to the status of those deals done under the framework that the Supreme Court has ruled out? So really, continued uncertainty, but at least temporarily, it's a bit-- 10% is lower than what they were paying, or what was being paid previously.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> OK, so let's talk about something else that also made headlines. Japan, they just recently had an election that's created a lot of headlines. Explain to us what happened there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Well, basically, the LDP has won a supermajority. So it's the largest, led by Sanae Takaichi.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> You said that very well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Pardon me. It has won the largest majority, really, in the post-war era in Japan, so even larger than Shinzo Abe's major wins in the early 2010s. And so, it's very positive in terms of they have a clear agenda that they can get passed. They can focus on return on their policy as opposed to necessarily, say, buying votes through policy, which is good. There's no concerns the budget will easily pass.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are all positive for Japan going forward. It removes an element of uncertainty in terms of the fiscal agenda, which is great.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> OK, so you said it removes some of the uncertainty and there are benefits to that. But talk about some of the risks of this supermajority.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> I mean, with the ability to change the constitution, I would say that as investors, the biggest risk would be choosing nationalistic interests over economic interests. Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, also known as the pacifist clause, has gotten a lot of headlines as several prior prime ministers have tried to change it. Essentially, it creates an ambiguity around Japan's right to defend themselves. And with the supermajority, they have the ability to change the constitution. This will likely lead to increased tensions with China. I think we saw a symptom of this last night when China released, I think it was 20 companies in Japan with export restrictions. So...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> OK. And now what about the potential opportunities for investors going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> I mean, the upside right now, I'd say one of the biggest ones, they've talked about consumption tax going to zero on food. This would be positive for overall consumption. I doubt people are going to spend more on food. They're just going to have more money to spend on other things besides food, so that should be positive for consumption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There's also positives with the infrastructure rollout. She's talked about nuclear restarts. Cheaper power is good for economic growth. So that would be positive for, say, construction engineering names. Kajima (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KAJMY\" title=\"Kajima Corporation\">KAJMY</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KAJMF\" title=\"Kajima Corporation\">KAJMF</a>) would be an example. There's four or five of them that are quite similar. There's also-- it will be positive for defense companies, the same list that was listed, the release from China last night.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Are there any names that specifically stand out for you?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Mitsubishi Heavy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MHVYF\" title=\"Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.\">MHVYF</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MHVIY\" title=\"Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.\">MHVIY</a>) would be a name. IHI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IHICY\" title=\"IHI Corporation\">IHICY</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IHICF\" title=\"IHI Corporation\">IHICF</a>) would be another name. And those would be two of the larger defense names within Japan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> And in terms of the sectors that you're focused on, would they be-- you said defense. Is there any other sectors that you'd be focused on?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Largely in industrial space. And then, of course, part of the fiscal stimulus would be the technology sector in Japan. That's led by semiconductor capital equipment. Tokyo Electron would be a prime beneficiary of that there. But there are other names, whether it be Disco Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DSCSY\" title=\"Disco Corporation\">DSCSY</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DISPF\" title=\"Disco Corporation\">DISPF</a>), Lasertec (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LSRCF\" title=\"Lasertec Corporation\">LSRCF</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LSRCY\" title=\"Lasertec Corporation\">LSRCY</a>). Many of them have fancy names. So...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Some names we'll be focused on going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Yeah, it would be technology, industrials. And hopefully some relief in consumer, but that's not an area that we're focused in.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.moneytalkgo.com/video/a-global-view-on-investing-as-new-tariffs-come-into-effect/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p>",

Since then, the company’s share price has increased by approximately 15% -and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> about 115% since my </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4799663-nebius-explosive-growth-but-zero-profits\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">first coverage</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">-but it has demonstrated high volatility.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This article examines NBIS’ hidden asset, given that it benefits not only from AI infrastructure solutions but also from its software solutions of Aether, Token Factory, and Tavily. In my view, NBIS aims to be a “one-stop shop” for AI solutions for large- and mid-sized companies and startups.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I remain bullish on Nebius, and I believe that it is still undervalued based on its growth potential and sticky business model. The recent price volatility was a result of profit-taking and macroeconomic uncertainty.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hardware Solutions Still Appear Impressive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nebius continues to report impressive <a href=\"https://assets.nebius.com/assets/e59fb92e-9027-473a-8cac-04f9d2e9ea9a/Shareholder%20Letter%20Q4%202025.pdf?cache-buster=2026-02-12T11:43:13.446Z&amp;_gl=1*1b82ge3*_gcl_au*MTA4MzAxNjY3Ni4xNzcxNjAzMjEx\" rel=\"nofollow\">results</a> and continues to show high demand for its AI hardware solutions. Notably, the company’s management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869424-nebius-group-n-v-nbis-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">stated</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Demand remains robust, and our pipeline continues to grow substantially. We sold out of capacity in Q3 and Q4 last year, and we're already now in Q1 of 2026 also sold out. In Q4, we delivered group revenue of $228 million, representing year-over-year growth of 547%. Revenue grew 56% from Q3 to Q4. Annualized run rate revenue for the core business stood at $1.2 billion at the end of December, exceeding the high end of our Q3 guidance range of $1.1 billion. The results of our core AI cloud business were even more impressive. Revenue grew 830% year-over-year and 63% quarter-over-quarter. This was driven by high utilization, strong pricing, and strong execution.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I want to highlight some major insights from the above statement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. Demand for NBIS’ hardware solutions - such as GPUs and full-rack systems—remains impressive, as capacity was sold out in Q3 and Q4 of FY25 and is already sold out for Q1<span></span> '26.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. The company achieved positive adjusted EBITDA for the first time, which is a key milestone, supporting my view from the last article that NBIS is balancing growth and profitability to drive long-term value. Also, the company reported Q4<span></span> '25 revenue of $228 million, up 547% YoY and 56% QoQ, with its core AI business increasing by 830% YoY and 63% QoQ.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730917986746_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"872\" data-height=\"282\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730917986746_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q4’25 highlights\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"207\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730917986746_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730917986746_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730917986746_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730917986746_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Letter to shareholders Q4<span></span></span> '2<span>5</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. Due to the high demand and the fact that its capacity is continually sold out, NBIS announced the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869424-nebius-group-n-v-nbis-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">development</a> of 9 new data center sites, aiming to reach a total of 16 sites globally.

Before moving to the last major insights, let me highlight the company’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869424-nebius-group-n-v-nbis-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">statement below</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>In terms of deal trends, they're all moving in the right direction. Deal terms are getting longer and average deal sizes are increasing. In Q4, we saw nearly twice as many transactions completed over 12 months in duration over what we succeeded with in Q3, while average selling prices increased by more than 50%.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, NBIS almost doubled its contract with a duration of over 12 months in Q4<span></span> '25, compared to Q3<span></span> '25. Also, average selling prices (ASP) increased by more than 50% in the same period, in combination with higher average deal sizes. This means longer-duration contracts, with more GPUs and general hardware per client, at higher prices, reflecting the company’s pricing power and strong growth trajectory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, Nebius maintains impressive momentum, driven by its expanding data center and AI infrastructure business, which continues to run at full capacity; therefore, I expect Nebius’ revenue growth to remain strong.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond Hardware, NBIS’ Software Could Be the Main Growth Catalyst</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s main revenue comes from building full-stack infrastructure services. However, many investors believe that Nebius only develops and leases its own data centers, but the truth is that it also offers full software solutions and not only bare metal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, the company’s management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869424-nebius-group-n-v-nbis-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">stated</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>At this stage, 100% of our AI cloud customers are utilizing our AI cloud software, obviously. So we have a 100% attach rate. We're very excited, by the way, about the new products that we've launched like Token Factory and the Aether releases, which have opened up TAM and give us an opportunity to expand into enterprise. Our new acquisition of Tavily also extends our platform capabilities by providing agentic search for AI developers, creating more routes into accounts… We're really in the early stages of our monetization journey, but our software and services make our platform sticky, which enables us to charge more on a relative per GPU hour. We are exploring other monetization models, including consumption based such as per token pricing with Token Factory.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me break down the above statements:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>NBIS, in combination with its AI hardware infrastructure, offers AI cloud software solutions through Aether, which helps orchestrate and manage AI workloads. The important point is that all of its clients use Aether.</li> <li>With <a href=\"https://nebius.com/services/token-factory\" rel=\"nofollow\">Token Factory</a>, NBIS expands its TAM, in my view, as small and mid-sized enterprises and startups can leverage the platform to customize, deploy, and optimize open-source AI models. The company monetizes Token Factory under a consumption-based model.

Still, bare-metal solutions remain the company’s main growth driver; however, it is well positioned to leverage its AI software products. With a 100% attach rate in AI cloud software solutions, increasing selling prices, and longer contract durations, NBIS appears to have a very sticky business model, which I believe is under the radar of Wall Street’s analysts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation and Risk Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nebius seems undervalued compared to its main competitor, CoreWeave (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWV\" title=\"CoreWeave, Inc.\">CRWV</a>), based on FWD EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA ratios, while it seems slightly overvalued based on FWD P/S ratios. These mixed valuation signals do not reflect the fact that NBIS expects significantly higher triple-digit growth over the next two years compared to CRWV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-1771973359793738.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Key metrics comparison with major peer\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"410\" height=\"294\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-1771973359793738.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-1771973359793738.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Analysis’ Results</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors need to understand NBIS’s business model to assess the company’s risks and valuation position. Analysts have an average price target of about $147, which means a potential 44% upside from the current stock price. In my opinion, this target price reflects only the company’s hardware solutions. Therefore, considering its AI software cross-selling opportunities, I believe a fair target price should be closer to $200.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730919735312_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1062\" data-height=\"328\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730919735312_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Target price\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"198\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730919735312_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730919735312_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730919735312_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730919735312_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding risk assessment, as I already mentioned in my last coverage, NBIS continues to minimize execution risks significantly, given that it has already <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869424-nebius-group-n-v-nbis-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">serviced</a> its contract with Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) and delivered the first tranche of its commitment to Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) on time.

Output growth in many emerging economies continues to outpace that of developed markets, whether inflation trends are disinflationary – as in China – or remain relatively sticky – as in Brazil. Higher economic growth and elevated country risk typically translate into higher interest rates, and the prospect of stronger returns attracted significant capital inflows. At the same time, volatility in developed markets - driven partly by fluctuations in US tariff rates – altered risk profiles and added to concerns around slower growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>msci em and crude oil price</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"868\" data-height=\"570\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"msci em and crude oil price\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"420\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, investors in search of safe-haven assets moved towards gold, while more risk-tolerant investors favoured emerging market equities.

A weaker dollar can make higher-yielding currencies more attractive, increasing the appeal of emerging markets. The markets also offer geographical diversification at a time when tariff exposure and geopolitical tensions remain significant. Emerging economies with limited trade surpluses with the US may be particularly well placed to help hedge against geopolitical risks.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">geopolitical risk and volatility index</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"894\" data-height=\"563\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"geopolitical risk and volatility index\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"403\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Export-driven economies – such as South Korea, Taiwan, and China – are still exposed to potential tariff changes as the US administration continues to focus on reducing its trade deficit. However, these economies hold competitive positions in advanced manufacturing. Recent earnings from SK Hynix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HXSC.F\" title=\"SK hynix Inc.\">HXSC.F</a>) illustrate the continued strength of Korean semiconductor demand. Similar momentum is evident in China and Taiwan, where the semiconductors, telecommunications and AI-related sectors remain important contributors to market performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In December, Chinese policymakers met at the annual Central Economic Work Conference to outline the economic agenda for 2026. Key priorities included stimulating consumption and investment to support growth of around 5%. One challenge highlighted was the imbalance between strong domestic supply and weak domestic demand. Despite a record trade surplus in 2025, internal demand remains subdued. Authorities aim to revive investment following a slowdown in the second half of the year, with an emphasis on strengthening domestic-focused activity rather than prioritising the export-oriented manufacturing sector, which has remained resilient. China’s budget deficit target is expected to stay close to last year's record 4% of GDP, reflecting sustained public spending to support demand during the ongoing residential property downturn. Liquidity injections through lower reserve-requirement ratios and targeted interest rate reductions are likely, although any monetary easing is expected to be incremental.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chinese equity indices</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"873\" data-height=\"565\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chinese equity indices\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"414\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Shanghai Composite Index rose 18% last year, its strongest annual performance since 2020. Between 2021 and 2025, technology companies represented over 90% of new listings in China, and the sector now accounts for more than a quarter of total market capitalisation. In 2025, the MSCI China gained 28%, while the CSI 300 rose 18%. Forecasts suggest further gains in 2026, supported by AI and technology-driven momentum, even though household confidence remains muted. Chinese equities continue to offer diversification benefits, with a reasonably generally constructive macroeconomic backdrop. Chinese sovereign yields are expected to stay range-bound, constrained by disinflationary forces on the upside and a less accommodative monetary stance on the downside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In South Korea, a significant share of equities continues to trade below book value. Ongoing efforts to improve corporate governance could help unlock value, with Japan’s experience offering potential guide for attracting foreign investment. China’s actions to curb disorderly price competition and address inefficiencies among producers may also support market performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Elsewhere in Asia, Indonesia and Thailand could see further gains in 2026, supported by policies aimed at strengthening domestic demand. Handouts to low-income households and expansionary fiscal measures are expected to bolster consumption and underpin growth in Indonesia. India has also introduced measures to support household spending, including reforms to goods and services taxes. However, Indian equities underperformed other emerging markets in 2025. High valuations, higher-than-expected tariffs, and pressures on the software sector could delay a broader recovery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For Saudi Arabia, despite expectations of softer oil prices, equities may benefit from the potential relaxation of foreign-ownership limits on listed companies. This reform could generate passive inflows estimated at up to $10 billion and may help lift a market that, like India, lagged broader emerging market performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, emerging markets are well positioned for 2026. Volatility in developed markets is likely to remain above historical norms, and geopolitical tensions – particularly in the run-up to the US mid-term elections – are expected to persist. Structural trends, including the central role of key Asian economies in global supply chains and the favourable outlook for selected commodities, should continue to support emerging-market performance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Legal Disclaimer</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Republication or redistribution of LSE Group content is prohibited without our prior written consent.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>The content of this publication is for informational purposes only and has no legal effect, does not form part of any contract, does not, and does not seek to constitute advice of any nature and no reliance should be placed upon statements contained herein.

By design, these companies have to depend on external capital to develop (since they have to pay most of what they make as dividends), while the SOFR takes into account much more than just what the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"fed\" htloopnumber=\"354047045\">Fed</em> does.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we can see in GLPI's case, their latest debt issuance from back in August 2025 came with coupons of 5.25% ($600 million 2033 notes) and 5.75% ($700 million 2037 notes), and although this pushed their maturities significantly, these are still relatively high yields, while issuing stock still costs about 6.5% nowadays, which limits their ability to deliver significant accretion through investments, with an 8.51% weighted average cap rate they expect on their future pipeline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although we’re talking about a theoretically much more limited and slower growth environment (especially due to the rise of online and potential regulatory limitations), the industry is also facing the trends seen in the country’s general real estate, with the post-pandemic boom in construction now reverting due to weak occupancy rates and rising costs seen all across the board, from workforce and materials to debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, GLPI continues to have a very strong pipeline with attractive cap rates, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872978-gaming-and-leisure-properties-inc-glpi-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872978-gaming-and-leisure-properties-inc-glpi-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">recently highlighting</a> their “$2.6 billion of future capital commitments poised for deployment over the next 24 months,” with mega-projects such as Bally's Lincoln and Chicago, Live!

Jokes aside, iGaming can be a way for traditional operators to not only attract new people and diversify (especially the big players), but also promote their physical operations as needed, although I continue to believe that these companies should focus especially on the experience as a whole.

Rather, it operates in the niche terrain of MRAM (Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory) technology, which is a small subset of the broader semiconductor memory market.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189775324106_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"781\" data-height=\"446\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189775324106_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MRAM market growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"365\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189775324106_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189775324106_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189775324106_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189775324106_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Precedence Research</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At a<a href=\"https://www.precedenceresearch.com/magnetoresistive-random-access-memory-market\" rel=\"nofollow\"> market size of less than $6B</a> (which represents only around<a href=\"https://www.precedenceresearch.com/semiconductor-memory-market\" rel=\"nofollow\"> 5%</a> of the semiconductor memory market), the global MRAM market is certainly not as prominent as traditional memory technologies such as DRAM, SRAM and NAND Flash, but the growth potential of this market (and incumbents such as Everspin) should not be played down. To elaborate, while the broader memory market will likely only grow at 7% through the next decade, the MRAM market is expected to grow at a pace of 4x more, at +30% levels!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MRAM, I feel, will see plenty of takers, as it is something of a disruptor technology that seeks to combine the best of what NAND Flash, SRAM and DRAM have to offer. What if you could have a technology that infuses the cost economics of volatile memory such as DRAM, the superior access speed of another volatile memory-SRAM, and the memory retention capabilities of non-volatile NAND? Semiconductor specialists refer to this as ‘Universal Memory’, and MRAM’s value proposition comes from its ability to harness the unique capabilities of some of the important memory sub-categories. Put simply, you’re looking at a tech that marries the performance of memory with the staying power of storage.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189784207728_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1034\" data-height=\"570\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189784207728_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MRAM Value proposition\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"353\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189784207728_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189784207728_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189784207728_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189784207728_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>January 2026 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This seemingly all-in-one facet of MRAM’s technology, enables it to thrive an flourish in a wide array of critical applications that could be subject to high radiation, high temperature</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>What Is The Next Catalyst For MRAM Stock?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most immediate major catalyst that I see for MRAM is its Q4 and FY results, that will be released on the<a href=\"https://investor.everspin.com/news-releases/news-release-details/everspin-announces-date-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\"> 4th of March</a>.

The chart below suggests that MRAM’s revenue growth trajectory tends to move around in cycles (the peak can get to sturdy levels of 80%, while it can also plummet to -40% during down cycles), and we are currently somewhere in the middle.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018970047151_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"647\" data-height=\"438\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018970047151_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Revenue growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"433\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018970047151_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018970047151_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018970047151_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018970047151_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCharts</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having said that, we believe that MRAM is on a long-term journey of reducing lumpy and volatile licensing and royalty fees (which is what mainly causes the spikes and troughs in revenue growth) to that of more consistent “product sales” oriented revenue profile (as of 9M-25<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/29677481\"> 86%</a> of MRAM’s revenue came product sales, and long-term management implied they want to get it to 90% or<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4838875-everspin-technologies-inc-mram-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\"> just 10%</a> from nonproduct sales).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because of the gradual shift towards product sales, investors should not be too upset to see MRAM’s gross margin profile continue to trend lower in Q4 and FY25 as a whole. For context, between FY21 and FY24, the gross margin profile contracted by over 800bps, and even as of 9M-25 there was further contraction (to the 51.3%). Investors should also keep in mind that relatively new additions (<a href=\"https://investor.everspin.com/news-releases/news-release-details/everspin-expands-high-reliability-mram-portfolio-new-automotive\" rel=\"nofollow\">EM064LX HR and EM128LX HR</a>) to MRAM’s PERSYST EMxxLX family would likely have seen a production ramp up in Q4-25 (ramp up costs of new products typically start at lower initial yields)</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189706396449.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Gross margins\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"481\" height=\"289\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189706396449.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189706396449.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189706396449.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Prepared by the writer using data from the Jan 2026 presentation and 10Q</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market will also be looking to see if MRAM can continue to enhance its collection efficiency on its receivables' portfolio, which would reflect well on the quality of the cash flow that this business is generating. By quality of cash flow, I mean to say that during 9M-24 note that cash generated from receivables was quite minimal at $0.147M, with the adding back of SBC (Stock-based compensation) serving as the overwhelming source of operating cash flows. However, as of 9M-25, SBC expenses were trending lower by 14% at $4.4M and only accounted for 60% of the operating cash flow. A good chunk of the structural cash flow is coming from superior receivable collections, which stood at over $3M!</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018979555366_origin.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"668\" data-height=\"709\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018979555366_origin.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Cash flow statement\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"679\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018979555366_origin.jpeg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018979555366_origin.jpeg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018979555366_origin.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018979555366_origin.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

Despite the uneven markets, Insteel may be in an appealing position for growth as<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> it develops relationships with engineering, procurement, and construction firms developing these large-scale facilities, potentially leading to recurring business over the coming years.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to this, management is reinvesting in operations to optimize production while lowering the cost to produce. Given the strengthening market dynamics, I am upgrading IIIN shares from <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4762965-insteel-industries-may-benefit-from-section-232-tariffs\">my previous \"Buy\" rating</a> to a \"Strong Buy\" rating with a price target of $46/share at 8.63x eFY27 EV/aEBITDA.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insteel Industries Operational Update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insteel’s q1’26 results were underpinned by strong selling prices and volumes offsetting input costs for materials like steel wire rods and scrap steel moving out of inventory, leading to the sequential compression of the gross margin. With steel shipments growing by 3.8% when compared to the previous year, pricing for Insteel’s concrete-enforced products likely drove the 23% year-over-year revenue in q1’26. Accordingly, average selling prices increased by 18.8%, driven by strong demand in the commercial and infrastructure markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Though the construction industry is presenting uneven growth dynamics, particularly for residential construction, the industrial data center market remains robust, providing a unique opportunity for Insteel to partner with engineering, procurement, and construction firms for materials sourcing. <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/the-data-center-balance-how-us-states-can-navigate-the-opportunities-and-challenges\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/the-data-center-balance-how-us-states-can-navigate-the-opportunities-and-challenges\" target=\"_blank\">According to McKinsey</a>, roughly $300<span> billion</span> will be invested for site construction [inclusive of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing] from 2025-2030, creating a massive opportunity for durable growth over the coming years. In addition to constructing the facilities, service roads and supporting infrastructure will need to be constructed, potentially providing additional materials that Insteels can supply. In addition to this, the regionality could potentially drive residential developments to support data center operations, particularly given that sites are being considered in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872782-texas-pacific-land-pivots-towards-long-term-data-center-strategy\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872782-texas-pacific-land-pivots-towards-long-term-data-center-strategy\" target=\"_blank\">West Texas in the Midland Basin</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the broad opportunities at hand, Insteel may be limited for growth given domestic production constraints for wire rod following two plant closures in the US. Accordingly, <a href=\"https://www.steelorbis.com/steel-news/latest-news/nucor-to-suspend-wire-rod-production-at-connecticut-plant-amid-challenging-market-conditions-1373645.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.steelorbis.com/steel-news/latest-news/nucor-to-suspend-wire-rod-production-at-connecticut-plant-amid-challenging-market-conditions-1373645.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Nucor</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NUE\" title=\"Nucor Corporation\">NUE</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.steelorbis.com/steel-news/latest-news/liberty-steel-wire-and-rod-plant-seen-restarting-in-march-pending-financial-arrangements-1366109.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.steelorbis.com/steel-news/latest-news/liberty-steel-wire-and-rod-plant-seen-restarting-in-march-pending-financial-arrangements-1366109.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Liberty Steel</a> each idled wire rod rolling mills in the U<span>nited States</span> as a result of challenging economics for the steel products, reducing domestic production by 800,000 tons per year, creating a wider dispersion between demand and domestic supply. This has largely pushed Insteel to augment capacity by importing wire rod, impacting gross margins due to the higher costs to import. Accordingly, this will likely continue through the remainder of eFY26, particularly given the strengthening industrial construction market environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another factor that may impact Insteel’s market is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4858860-exxon-mobil-2030-plan-more-robust-than-initial-forecast\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4858860-exxon-mobil-2030-plan-more-robust-than-initial-forecast\" target=\"_blank\">Exxon Mobil’s</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>) entrance into the building materials industry with Proxxima, a corrosion-resistant, carbon-based material designed as an alternative to rebar. <a href=\"https://www.proxxima.com/en/markets/infrastructure\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.proxxima.com/en/markets/infrastructure\" target=\"_blank\">Accordingly, Proxxima</a> is 75% lighter than steel and can be installed 40% faster than steel rebar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Section 232 tariffs imposed in 2025 have resulted in mixed economic factors that have impacted Insteel in recent quarters. From a pricing perspective for PC strand, steel product import restrictions have resulted in stronger pricing power for Insteel, allowing the company to realize substantial price increases for its steel products. On the other hand, import restrictions have impacted material costs for domestically produced wire rod, negatively affecting Insteel’s margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Relating to steel tariffs, <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/trump-plans-to-roll-back-some-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminum-goods-ft-reports/ar-AA1WiY5Y?ocid=BingNewsSerp\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/trump-plans-to-roll-back-some-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminum-goods-ft-reports/ar-AA1WiY5Y?ocid=BingNewsSerp\" target=\"_blank\">President Trump</a> has been hinting at the possibility of rolling back certain steel product import tariffs to ease consumer inflationary pressures. This could potentially impact Insteel’s PC strand used in slab-on-grade construction for housing units, though which steel products the president is considering isn’t fully known.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insteel Industries Financial Position</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-17720348959605935_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"283\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-17720348959605935_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Corporate Filings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"186\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-17720348959605935_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-17720348959605935_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-17720348959605935_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-17720348959605935_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Corporate Filings</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead to eq2’26, I’m forecasting Insteel to generate $189.6 million in net revenue with a diluted EPS of $0.71/share. My forecast considers pricing dynamics for steel imports and improving operating leverage along with acquisition-related costs rolling off. Overall, I believe the market Insteel participates in is supportive of volume and pricing growth for eFY26, potentially driving another year of strong revenue generation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insteel closed q1’26 with 109 days of inventory on hand, up from 90 days in the prior quarter as a result of higher-cost materials going into inventory. Higher materials costs may have been, in part, impacted by tariff costs on steel product imports, which still remain at 50%. Accordingly, Insteel purchased offshore wire rod in the quarter to offset limited domestic supply.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result of the necessary steel imports, Insteel may experience relatively elevated inventory levels until the domestic market normalizes, which may not occur in eFY26. This may result in higher input costs for the time being, given the high import tax, shipment costs, and bulk materials imported to facilitate PC production.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insteel closed q1’26 with $15.6 million in cash &amp; equivalents and no debt on the balance sheet; Insteel has $100 million in available liquidity through its revolving credit facility, providing the firm substantial flexibility to continue to grow through acquisition and reinvestment going forward. As part of Insteel’s capital allocation plan for eFY26, the firm will be investing in its plants to support yields for engineered structural mesh with the intent of reducing production costs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks Related to Insteel Industries</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bull Case</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Large-scale data center developments may drive multiple verticals for growth, including facility construction, service roads, and potentially surrounding-area residential developments in desolate regions. Despite input cost pressures, Insteel has been successful in dynamically increasing prices for PC strand, offsetting margin risk. Reinvested capital in production may improve operating leverage over time.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bear Case</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Input costs may lead to choppy inventory management and margins for the coming quarters. Exxon’s entrance into the building materials market could potentially impact Insteel’s market long-term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation &amp; Shareholder Value</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-1772034904366721_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"176\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-1772034904366721_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Corporate Filings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"116\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-1772034904366721_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-1772034904366721_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-1772034904366721_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-1772034904366721_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Corporate Filings</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IIIN shares are currently trading at an appealing valuation at 8.49x EV/aEBITDA, creating an appealing buying opportunity for investors seeking to enter into a position.

The markets are full of stories about companies pivoting from<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a cyclical narrative to an AI narrative and since my </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846470-cipher-the-silent-winner-of-ai-infra\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">last coverage</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> CIFR is up 21% validating my pivot thesis. Therefore, CIFR remains a strong buy and can easily rerate as hyperscale lease cash flows replace mining volatility.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">From Bitcoin Cycles to Billion-Dollar Contracts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cipher Digital is no longer a bitcoin mining company. It has made a definitive pivot into a long-duration hyperscale-backed HPC infrastructure platform. The numbers associated with this pivot have now been achieved. The interesting thing about this time is not the narrative progression. It is the visibility of contract economics, capital structure engineering, and scale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the heart of this pivot is the <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/797/122797/original.pdf\">300 MW</a> hyperscale facility leased to Amazon Web Services with a 15-year contract with options. The economics associated with this contract alone have $5.5 billion in expected contracted revenue with Amazon’s guarantee of base rent and operating expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The economics also have a 100% NOI margin associated with the project level. That means revenue can be immediately turned into operating income before corporate overhead. This is a very different model from the mining business. The contract economics start October 2026. That means the inflection in the business will be seen in the next reporting cycles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Barber Lake adds another 300 MW of contracted HPC capacity. The combination of Black Pearl and Barber Lake adds 600 MW of HPC capacity versus 207 MW of bitcoin mining capacity. Pro forma, 74% of operating and contracted gross capacity is now HPC. Only 26% is associated with the mining business.

The energized capacity is 807 MW, but the new projection of energization scales considerably from there. Beginning from 2026 to 2027, there will be an additional <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/797/122797/original.pdf\">370 MW</a> from Ulysses, Reveille, and Stingray.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874069-cipher-mining-inc-cifr-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">3.4 GW pipeline</a> places Cipher in the position of relevant second-tier data center infrastructure developers rather than minor players in the space.

The good news is that the construction of the Barber Lake site is reportedly on track. Concrete foundations, steel erection, and underground work are all progressing. All design milestones have been achieved thus far in line with schedule.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874069-cipher-mining-inc-cifr-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">secured 95%</a> of long-lead-time equipment necessary for the project which helps remove supply-chain risk. The more important figure is that 100% of workforce requirements for the duration of the project have been secured. In an infrastructure play like this, workforce risk is often the biggest risk to execution. That risk seems to be removed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is reportedly on track to achieve contractual early access and substantial completion milestones. As lease payments do not begin until October 2026, timeline risk is an integral component of this valuation thesis. Construction photos suggest that the project is making material progress rather than just laying groundwork for the facility. That is visible infrastructure being assembled rather than concept drawings. If timelines are adhered to, then the revenue inflection window is now deterministic.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071768905864_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1151\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071768905864_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CIFR\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071768905864_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071768905864_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071768905864_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071768905864_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Business Update</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Black Pearl Economics: Long-Duration Cash Flow Engine</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Black Pearl lease agreement with AWS is a very strong structure. The 15-year lease agreement has 3 options to extend the lease by an additional 5 years. This equates to a 30-year potential revenue visibility. AWS will guarantee the fixed rent as well as operational expense reimbursement. This is a very strong structure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At 300 MW gross capacity and $5.5 billion in contracted revenue, this asset alone will reshape the earnings profile of Cipher. Assuming steady-state conversion at levels in-line with the project expectations, the internal return profile will have a very different look and feel from a bitcoin mining profile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is the inflection point. Once the Black Pearl asset is fully paying the rent, the perception will shift from a crypto-adjacent company to a hyperscale company. This will drive multiple re-rating opportunities.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-1772007966812225_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2170\" data-height=\"1230\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-1772007966812225_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CIFR\" width=\"640\" height=\"363\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-1772007966812225_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-1772007966812225_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-1772007966812225_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-1772007966812225_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Business Update</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation: Paying Up for the Growth Curve</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently trading at $17, CIFR is paying up for a hyper-growth infrastructure company. CIFR has a trailing sales multiple of about 27x and a forward sales multiple of about 24x, while sector medians are closer to 3x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While these multiples appear rich on an initial glance, consensus revenue growth estimates are expected to turn sharply from 2026’s run-rate of about $228 million to nearly $1 billion in 2027 and $3 billion in 2029. As such, the current premium rapidly compresses based on expected hyperscale scale rather than current mining industry revenue.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_90209b8b82e2b0b50c58592fee2a8526.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_90209b8b82e2b0b50c58592fee2a8526.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_90209b8b82e2b0b50c58592fee2a8526.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_90209b8b82e2b0b50c58592fee2a8526.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The One Risk That Truly Matters: Execution Timing</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The one critial risk I see to the investment thesis is the execution timing for Black Pearl and Barber Lake projects. Everything in this valuation hinges on these projects substantially completing and energizing within a specific timeframe. Lease payments are based on these delivery milestones. If energization is delayed by a few quarters, the entire revenue inflection, the entire leverage situation, and the entire market narrative will change in a hurry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is a large-scale data center build and these types of projects are not without variables outside their control, including approvals for interconnection with the electric grid, transformer deliveries, contractor sequencing, and local regulatory approvals. Even with 95% of long-lead equipment deliveries and their workforce locked in, infrastructure projects are not always linear.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Structural failure is highly unlikely but even minor slippages will put pressure on the shares due to the premium valuation. Timing is everything.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is not a speculative mining play trying to understand how to play the adjacency to AI. They have hyperscale leases and they have structured them. They have a multi-year NOI growth story that fundamentally changes their nature as a public entity.</p>",

For the full year, the company grew its store count by one location. It's the first time since 2013 that MTY was able to grow its stores organically on a yearly basis. Given the challenging macro environment, I believe that's a great achievement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Wetzel's Pretzels and Cold Stone Creamery were the main drivers, growing their store counts </span><a href=\"https://mtygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/11.30.2025-MTY-AIF-51-102F2-EN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://mtygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/11.30.2025-MTY-AIF-51-102F2-EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">by 4.79%</a><span> and 9.51% respectively.

That is a CAGR of 10.52%, well above the brand's growth rate before the acquisition. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wetzel's Pretzels has exceeded my expectations as more franchisees are willing to open up new stores. Often, these are <a href=\"https://communityimpact.com/dallas-fort-worth/flower-mound-highland-village-argyle/dining/2026/01/20/sweetfrog-wetzels-pretzels-co-branded-store-coming-soon-to-flower-mound/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://communityimpact.com/dallas-fort-worth/flower-mound-highland-village-argyle/dining/2026/01/20/sweetfrog-wetzels-pretzels-co-branded-store-coming-soon-to-flower-mound/\" target=\"_blank\">co-branded stores</a> opened by existing franchisees. By offering multiple brands, the stores should attract more customers and generate higher sales, while at the same time cutting down on costs. It's a win-win for both the franchisees and MTY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By having around 90 brands to offer, there's a wide variety that franchisees can add to their existing stores. A competitive advantage that not many other players in the industry can match. On top of that, Wetzel's continues its expansion into <a href=\"https://www.franchising.com/news/20260218_wetzels_pretzels_debuts_first_walmart_location_in_tennessee.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.franchising.com/news/20260218_wetzels_pretzels_debuts_first_walmart_location_in_tennessee.html\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart locations</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872154-mty-food-group-inc-mty-ca-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872154-mty-food-group-inc-mty-ca-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">the conference call</a>, the company is in a good position to continue this positive momentum in 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Is the MTY Model Broken?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MTY hasn't acquired other businesses since 2022. For most other analysts, this seems to be a sign that the model is broken. After all, the company is a serial acquirer that has completed <a href=\"https://mtygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MTY_IR_Presentation_Q124_April-17-2024.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://mtygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MTY_IR_Presentation_Q124_April-17-2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">over 50 brand</a> acquisitions during the last 26 years. For me, cutting back on acquisitions in this environment is a sign of prudence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Right now, we're living in extraordinary times of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824019-schg-this-is-what-the-final-stages-of-a-bull-market-look-like\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824019-schg-this-is-what-the-final-stages-of-a-bull-market-look-like\" target=\"_blank\">elevated asset prices</a>. MTY historically paid low multiples for its acquisitions, which was the key to its success.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company never owned the best brands in the world, but all of its banners <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872154-mty-food-group-inc-mty-ca-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872154-mty-food-group-inc-mty-ca-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">are cash flow positive</a>. By paying reasonable valuations and reinvesting the profits, the compounded returns have been staggering for early investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Asset prices tend to be cyclical. By refraining from overpriced acquisitions now, MTY is lowering its debt and will be able to act whenever better opportunities arise. Despite not acquiring new brands since 2022, the number of locations has remained roughly stable over the last few years.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61007453-177193569590082_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1032\" data-height=\"624\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61007453-177193569590082_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Store Count\" width=\"640\" height=\"387\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"387\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61007453-177193569590082_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61007453-177193569590082_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61007453-177193569590082_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61007453-177193569590082_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Store Count <span>(MTY: Annual Information Form 2025 )</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">System-wide sales have been flat for the last three years.

The secret lies in its cash-generative business model, as the company primarily collects royalties from its franchisees and acquires brands at attractive valuations. For me, it's the Berkshire Hathaway of restaurant royalties.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Same-store sales decreased by 1.7% during the quarter, but it didn't hurt the company's cash generation. I put special emphasis on free cash flow (FCF) and FCF/share. After all, it's the cash that a business generates that funds the dividends, buybacks, and future investments, and pays down debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In previous articles, I labeled <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829593-mty-food-group-cash-flow-king-trading-at-a-cigar-butt-price\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829593-mty-food-group-cash-flow-king-trading-at-a-cigar-butt-price\" target=\"_blank\">MTY as the cash flow king, </a>and the company didn't disappoint. Free cash flow came in at CA$130.62 million for the fiscal year 2025.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61007453-17719360566062384_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1332\" data-height=\"552\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61007453-17719360566062384_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financial Highlights 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"265\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"265\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61007453-17719360566062384_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61007453-17719360566062384_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61007453-17719360566062384_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61007453-17719360566062384_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Financial Highlights 2025 <span>(MTY Q4 Results)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's 5.3% lower than the year before, but it had to be expected. In 2024, MTY paid exceptionally low income taxes due to <a href=\"https://mtygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/11.30.2024-MDA_EN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://mtygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/11.30.2024-MDA_EN.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">high impairment charges</a> related to Papa Murphy's. If we exclude this, FCF is roughly in line with the year before.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FCF/share came in at CA$5.68 in 2025, which translates to a P/FCF of 7.30 at current prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although not as cheap as it was at the end of last year, MTY remains one of the best bargains in the restaurant industry. This is especially true if we consider the debt levels, which have come down substantially over the last few years and are now approaching more reasonable levels.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Debt Levels</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the end of Q4, the company had net debt of CA$580 million, or a net debt/FCF of 4.44. It's still a bit higher than I'd like, but MTY is making great progress.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td>Year:</td> <td>2023</td> <td>2024</td> <td>2025</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Net Debt: (CA$ million)</td> <td>701</td> <td>654</td> <td>580</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Interest Expense: (CA$ million)</td> <td>52.1</td> <td>46.5</td> <td>35.0</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net debt and interest expense are heading in the right direction. MTY raised its <a href=\"https://mtygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260121-MTY-Declares-Its-Quarterly-Dividend.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://mtygroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20260121-MTY-Declares-Its-Quarterly-Dividend.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">dividend by 12%</a> this year and now distributes CA$33 million to its shareholders yearly. If we assume CA$130 million in FCF this year, it could lead to ~CA$100 million in further debt reduction this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At CA$480 million in net debt, I'd consider the debt levels as manageable even if the economic outlook were to worsen. This would be below the 4x net debt/FCF ratio that I consider as prudent for a highly cash generative business that is somewhat recession-resistant.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Growth at a Reasonable Price</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since its first dividend distribution 15 years ago, the payouts have risen at a CAGR of 15.08%. The current dividend yield is 3.57%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MTY is a highly cash generative business and distributes only 25% of its FCF to shareholders. In my opinion, it's one of the safer and most promising dividend growth plays in the current environment. The hated or overlooked usually make the best investments; it's where others aren't looking that you can find real value.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strategic Review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846075-mty-food-group-launches-strategic-review-why-shares-could-be-worth-double\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846075-mty-food-group-launches-strategic-review-why-shares-could-be-worth-double\" target=\"_blank\">previous article</a>, I focused extensively on a potential sale of the company. MTY confirmed that they initiated a strategic review and engaged a financial advisor to evaluate potential strategic alternatives to unlock shareholder value. Unfortunately, the CEO didn't answer any questions on the strategic review during the latest conference call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are rumors that a competitive bidding war between several groups is ongoing and offers may have climbed to the <a href=\"https://www.marketscreener.com/news/serruya-private-equity-and-recipe-unlimited-push-mty-food-group-bids-to-c-60-range-ce7e5bddd08ef224\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.marketscreener.com/news/serruya-private-equity-and-recipe-unlimited-push-mty-food-group-bids-to-c-60-range-ce7e5bddd08ef224\" target=\"_blank\">CA$60 per share range</a>. If true, it would imply a 45% premium to current share prices, but it would be well below my estimate of MTY's intrinsic value, which I view as around CA$85 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The ongoing strategic review reduces the risk of losing money over the short term, but it also lowers the chances of unlocking the true long-term potential of this overlooked compounder.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MTY had a decent Q4 and fiscal year 2025. The company keeps generating plenty of FCF while investors are waiting for news on the strategic review. Debt levels are coming down, and the business performed well in a rather challenging environment for the restaurant industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the review does not end in a full sale of the company, I expect share repurchases to continue. In that case, MTY could buy back slightly more than 10% of its shares a year at current prices without the need to issue new debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even if the underlying business would remain stagnant, that'd result in double-digit growth, which is great for a company that's trading at single-digit P/FCF ratios. While no investment is risk-free, I still consider MTY to be one of the better investments in today's exuberant market environment. It offers both long-term potential and a short-term catalyst to unlock shareholder value.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Mainline biopharma firms with well-known institutional life science venture firms and even strategic investment from major pharmaceutical companies typically command enterprise valuations at IPO of $250 million to $500 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Salspera’s proposed enterprise value at IPO of $859 million, given its thin capitalization, short operating history, small R&amp;D to date, and lack of collaboration relationships with larger pharmaceutical firms, is simply unsupportable, by a long shot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given these factors, the TKVA IPO represents an extremely high-risk proposition at an unacceptable valuation, so my outlook on it is to sell (avoid it).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expected IPO Pricing Date: To be announced</p>",

Many restaurants have been offering better deals to attract customers, and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> because of its competitors’ discounts, CAVA didn’t perform as well in the second half of 2025 as it did in the first half of the year. CAVA still performed better in Q4 2025 than I expected </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833041-cava-group-is-still-overvalued-if-sales-improve\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">in my previous article</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">, though. I now think CAVA will report stronger results in 2026, but it still seems like a lot of this restaurant’s growth is priced in already.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q4 2025, CAVA reported that its revenue rose 21.2% to $272.8 million. This was mostly because the restaurant group added new locations, because it only reported 0.5% same-store sales growth for the quarter. CAVA also reported that its adjusted EBITDA rose 2.8% to $25.8 million. So, it still looks like this restaurant group is investing most of its profits in new restaurants, and it plans to keep doing that in 2026 as well. CAVA expects to add 74 to 76 restaurants in 2026, and it had 439 restaurants at the end of 2025. So, it’s planning to increase its restaurant count by 17% in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because CAVA is expanding its restaurant count this aggressively, I don’t think it’s appropriate to use the forward P/E ratio for this stock. I think this company’s triple-digit forward P/E is misleading. But CAVA also has a trailing price-to-sales ratio of 7, which is very high for a restaurant. So, this restaurant needs to maintain a very high growth rate to justify its current valuation. And it may not have the pricing power to raise its menu prices right now, so this growth is likely to come from new locations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">CAVA Will Limit Its Price Increases in 2026</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consumers are under pressure right now, so fast-food chains are offering value meals and other deals to consumers who are trading down. Because of this competitive environment, CAVA limited its price increases in 2025, and that’s also why it reported weaker same-store sales growth in the fourth quarter. And it plans to limit its price increases in 2026 as well. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874212-cava-group-inc-cava-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">On the call</a>, CAVA CEO Brett Schulman explained, “Additionally, in January 2026, we implemented an approximate 1.4% in-restaurant menu price adjustment, and we do not plan to take any additional price in 2026.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, CAVA is guiding for same-store sales growth of 3% to 5% in 2026. Because it’s limiting its price increases, it will need more traffic to reach this goal. While the company did achieve 4% same-store sales growth in 2025, this was because it reported strong results in the first half of the year. So, CAVA will have to perform better than it did in the last 2 quarters to meet its guidance. Conservatively, I’d say 3% same-store sales growth in 2026 sounds more likely than a result at the top of the range.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">CAVA Will Still Grow Rapidly in 2026 Even If Its Same-Store Sales Weaken</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my previous article about CAVA, I projected that its revenue would grow 18% in 2026. Again, though, this company is now calling for 17% growth in new locations at the midpoint. So, even if CAVA reports 3% same-store sales growth in 2026, it could still perform better than I expected because of the additional revenue from its new restaurants. And it also sounds like its new restaurants are reporting good results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the call, CFO Tricia Tolivar said, “So yes, our -- what we shared when we were on the IPO roadshow was that a new restaurant starts at about $2.3 million in AUV and grows about 10% in year 1. And in fact, over the past 2 years, we've seen those restaurants open much higher than that and experienced, in some markets, a bit of a halo around those openings.” CAVA’s guidance includes the additional revenue growth from recently-added restaurants, and the restaurants it added in 2025 and 2024 have been performing well. So, my revenue growth estimate for CAVA may have been too low, and I’d say 20% growth in 2026 sounds more likely.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Long-Term Investment Thesis for CAVA Is Still Intact</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In theory, CAVA has a stronger moat than other restaurants because there aren’t any other nationwide Mediterranean fast-casual restaurant chains. Other fast-casual restaurant chains, such as Chipotle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMG\" title=\"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\">CMG</a>) and Shake Shack (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHAK\" title=\"Shake Shack Inc.\">SHAK</a>), have lots of direct competitors. But CAVA doesn’t have direct competitors with similar scale. This makes CAVA less vulnerable to price competition, because it’s not just competing on price. It can attract consumers who want an alternative to burger restaurants and taco shops.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, CAVA is also attracting long-term investors who aren’t as concerned about its quarterly reports and its quarterly same-store sales growth. They’re interested in the company’s long-term growth prospects. Additionally, CAVA doesn’t just appeal to customers who want Mediterranean food. Like other fast-casual restaurants, it’s positioned as a health-food restaurant. Consumers are still interested in health food, even though they have less money to spend right now. So, CAVA could also report much stronger results if the economy improves in the second half of 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cannibalization Is a Risk Factor</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If CAVA puts new restaurants too close to its older restaurants, the new restaurants could attract consumers away from the older restaurants. If this happens, CAVA’s same-store sales may fall. It doesn’t sound like cannibalization is a problem for CAVA right now, and management didn’t say anything about it on the Q4 call. But if the company adds new restaurants in neighborhoods where it already has restaurants, cannibalization could become a problem in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">CAVA’s Stock Price Already Reflects Its Long-Term Growth Potential</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, CAVA’s long-term growth potential is already priced into its stock. After the market close on February 24, CAVA had a forward EV/sales ratio of 6.81. If you compare this valuation to other fast-casual restaurants’ valuations, CAVA looks very expensive. Sweetgreen (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SG\" title=\"Sweetgreen, Inc.\">SG</a>), another “slop bowl” restaurant, has a forward EV/sales of 1.27 right now. Shake Shack has a forward EV/sales of 2.86. And Chipotle has a forward EV/sales of 3.99.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bulls might argue that a premium revenue multiple is justified because of CAVA’s high margins. CAVA is guiding for a restaurant-level profit margin of 23.7% to 24.2% in 2026, so it still has higher profit margins than other restaurants even though it’s limiting its price increases right now. But so do other fast-casual restaurants, and all of these restaurants’ margins are currently under pressure. Even high-income customers are interested in value right now, and they may trade down to restaurants that offer better deals. When a restaurant has much higher margins than its peers, that can also indicate that it’s not offering good deals to its customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_c72ba16b8e76ac3870ecfbf207d18924.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_c72ba16b8e76ac3870ecfbf207d18924.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_c72ba16b8e76ac3870ecfbf207d18924.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_c72ba16b8e76ac3870ecfbf207d18924.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Updated Valuation for CAVA</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like I said earlier, I still think CAVA will report higher sales growth than I expected in 2026 because it’s adding so many new locations. And this restaurant group outperformed my estimate for 2025 as well. CAVA’s full-year 2025 revenue was $1.169 billion, which was higher than my estimate of $1.156 billion. So, for fiscal 2026, I’ll project that CAVA’s revenue will rise 20% to $1.403 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CAVA’s TTM EV/sales ratio of 7 is very high for a restaurant, so I’ll also project that this ratio will fall to 6 in 2026. This would give CAVA an EV of $8.418 billion. After subtracting $443 million in debt and adding back $388 million in cash, the Mediterranean restaurant group would have a market cap of $8.363 billion. CAVA also has a diluted share count of 118.4 million shares. Since it will be spending its cash flow on new restaurants, I don’t expect it to buy back stock in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, if I divide a market cap of $8.363 billion by 118.4 million shares, I get a one-year target price of $71 per share. CAVA’s current share price is $68 per share, so my target is 4% higher than the current price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It sounds like CAVA’s new restaurants are performing well. I think my previous growth estimate for this company was too low, and it could report 20% revenue growth in 2026. By limiting its menu price increases, CAVA will be able to attract more value-oriented customers. So, I think CAVA will hit its same-store sales growth target in 2026, and it will continue to add new restaurants at a rapid pace as well. But I also think that this company’s current stock price already reflects very high-growth expectations. So, I maintain my hold rating on CAVA.</p>",
