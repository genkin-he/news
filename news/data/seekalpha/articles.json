After all, or so I thought, would there be that big of a difference between the two? Well, the big difference between the two has come in the form of the sector-leading performance the SMHX ETF has generated over the past year (see chart below). As you know, fabless semiconductor companies operate an asset-light business in that they design &amp; sell semiconductor chips but outsource the semiconductor fabrication to companies that have the expertise to operate the complex &amp; capital-intensive foundries that actually produce the chips. That being the case, the fabless business model certainly has some distinct advantages.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After completing my analysis (see below), I have come to the conclusion that the SMHX ETF is a BUY and should be considered as a core long-term technology holding in an otherwise well-diversified portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a3515c08974fa72e10ff7e8e3e254231.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a3515c08974fa72e10ff7e8e3e254231.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a3515c08974fa72e10ff7e8e3e254231.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a3515c08974fa72e10ff7e8e3e254231.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a3515c08974fa72e10ff7e8e3e254231.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a3515c08974fa72e10ff7e8e3e254231.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a3515c08974fa72e10ff7e8e3e254231.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a3515c08974fa72e10ff7e8e3e254231.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a3515c08974fa72e10ff7e8e3e254231.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see in the graphic above, the SMHX ETF has not only outperformed its sister fund SMH by a significant margin over the past year (by 7.6%), but has even more significantly outperformed the Fidelity Select Semiconductor ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FSELX\" title=\"Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio\">FSELX</a>) and the broad Philadelphia Semiconductor sector (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SOX\" title=\"Philadelphia Semiconductor Index\">SOX</a>).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is no doubt that global semiconductor sales are on fire:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"839\" data-height=\"636\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"August 2025 Global Semiconductor Revenue\" width=\"640\" height=\"485\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"485\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Semiconductor Industry Association</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see from the graphic above, global <a href=\"https://www.semiconductors.org/global-semiconductor-sales-increase-21-7-year-to-year-in-august/\" rel=\"nofollow\">semiconductor sales in August</a> were $64.9 billion and were +21.7% yoy and were +4.4% as compared to the July 2025 total of $62.1 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, the foundry model enables fabless semiconductor companies to focus on chip architecture and cutting-edge circuit design without incurring the significant cap-ex and risks associated with operating leading-edge fabrication facilities. By partnering with semiconductor foundries, fabless semiconductor companies can gain access to leading-edge design nodes without the hassle of &amp; costs associated with in-house logistics and production.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fabless semiconductor/foundry partnership model has been a grand success over the past few decades to the great benefit of the entire semiconductor industry because it enables all companies involved to focus on what they do best. That being the case, fabless semiconductor companies have two succinct advantages: cost-efficiency &amp; flexibility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the \"flexibility\" factor has arguably shrunk dramatically over the past few years because one company (Taiwan Semiconductor) has come to absolutely dominate the high-performance leading-edge of semiconductor manufacturing technology that is critical when it comes to delivering the high-speed, low-power technology required for today's AI processors and high-speed networking equipment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Obviously, a fabless semiconductor ETF like SMHX will <em>not</em> give investors exposure to some of the leading foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>), GlobalFoundries (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GFS\" title=\"GlobalFoundries Inc.\">GFS</a>), Micron Technology (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU\" title=\"Micron Technology, Inc.\">MU</a>), SK Hynix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HXSCF\" title=\"SK hynix Inc.\">OTCPK:HXSCF</a>), and Intel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC\" title=\"Intel Corporation\">INTC</a>) - among others. Indeed, the lack of TSMC in the portfolio was the primary factor that I did not invest in SMHX when it first came out, and instead chose to simply add to my existing full-position in the SMH ETF. In hindsight, that was an error on my part.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that as background, let's take a closer look at the SMHX ETF, starting with the portfolio.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top 10 Holdings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The top 10 holdings in the SMHX ETF are shown below and were taken directly from the <a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/fabless-semiconductor-etf-smhx/overview/\" rel=\"noopener\">VanEck SMHX ETF webpage</a>, where you can find more detailed information on the fund:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"666\" data-height=\"597\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SMHX ETF Top-10 Holdings\" width=\"640\" height=\"574\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"574\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>VanEck</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see from the graphic, the top three holdings - which in aggregate equate to 41% of the entire portfolio - are composed of the three leading providers of AI compute engines: NVIDIA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>), Broadcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>), and AMD (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>).

In the SMH ETF, these two holdings combine for only a 5.14% weight. Both EDA companies became embroiled in the tariff/security war going on between the United States and China and at one point had restrictions on sales to China. Synopsys' restrictions, which were subsequently <a href=\"https://news.synopsys.com/2025-07-02-Synopsys-Issues-Statement-in-Connection-to-the-Lifting-of-Recent-U-S-Export-Restrictions-Related-to-China\" rel=\"nofollow\">lifted in July</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cadence agreed to <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/28/cadence-to-plead-guilty-and-pay-140-million-to-us-for-china-sales.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener\">plead guilty and pay $140 million</a> to resolve U.S. Justice Department charges that it sold chip-design software to a Chinese military university thought to be involved in performing nuclear simulations. Synopsys stock is -17.8% over the past year yet still trades at a relatively lofty forward P/E=35.5x. Cadence has fared much better and is +15.2% over the past twelve months and has a forward P/E of a whopping 48.4x. On Monday, Cadence released strong <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4508950-cadence-design-systems-non-gaap-eps-of-1_93-beats-by-0_14-revenue-of-1_34b-beats-by-20m\">Q3 earnings</a> (a beat on both the top &amp; bottom lines) and lifted its FY25 outlook to 14% revenue growth and 18% EPS growth while reporting a record <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509071-cadence-raises-2025-outlook-to-14-percent-revenue-growth-and-18-percent-eps-growth-amid-ai\">$7 billion backlog</a> - all of these results were driven by the AI data center boom.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As mentioned earlier, the SMHX ETF doesn't have a long-term performance track record since its inception date was on 8/24/2024.

However, you can't argue with the returns, so I put up with it (on SMH, I don't yet own SMHX but am considering a stake in the fund).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see from the assets-under-management, SMHX is still a relatively small fund (in comparison, SMH has $37.1 billion in assets). That's a double-edged sword in my opinion: if there's a big market sell-off, there could be liquidity issues if investors all rush for the door at the same time. On the other hand, if money were to move into the fund in significant volume, it could result in concentrated buying in the fund's small number of holdings that might actually be a bullish factor. Meantime, as you can see from the TTM P/E ratio, SMHX is trading at a significant premium to the S&amp;P500 (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SMHX/\" rel=\"nofollow\">P/E=32x</a>).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The semiconductor sector is trading at a lofty valuation level due to the extremely bullish fundamentals of hyperscalers (and others) spending—in aggregate—$100's of billions of dollars annually on the AI data center buildout. Many analysts say we are in an \"AI bubble\" that could pop. I don't see that happening any time soon, but that doesn't mean it couldn't or that it one day won't. It could come about via the lack of electrical power capacity, so-called \"circular financing\" gone awry, or the ROE on AI simply not meeting expectations that eventually lead to a slowdown in new AI data center capacity being built.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My own opinion is that the hyperscalers funding this \"hype\" are cash-rich and generating tons of free cash flow and are therefore funding their AI capex from the tremendously profitable platforms they are already operating. If you think I am smoking something, I suggest you take a look at Google's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) <a href=\"https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/2025q3-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q3 earnings report</a>. Absolutely fantastic and exactly what I predicted in my recent widely-read Seeking Alpha article, \"<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830520-alphabet-the-ai-leader-openai-is-still-chasing\">Google: The AI Leader OpenAI Is Still Chasing (And Will Never Catch)\"</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My point here is that the so-called \"AI hype\" has staying power because none of the leading hyperscalers want to stop investing and run the risk of falling behind. META, for instance, is doubling-down on its arguably large AI infrastructure spending. That may be because its CEO Mark Zuckerberg might realize that META's own foundational model (Llama) arguably isn't up to snuff as compared to Google's Gemini+, OpenAI's ChatGPT, or Anthropic's Claude.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regardless, I think - barring some kind of geopolitical disaster (which is certainly possible these days ...) - we're good-to-go at least thru the end of calendar year 2026. There will certainly be humps-n-bumps along the road, but in my opinion, the AI technology revolution is going to last for the rest of our lives.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary &amp; Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My followers know that I advise investors to build a well-diversified portfolio on the foundation of a high-quality, low-cost S&amp;P500 ETF (like VOO) and to overweight that portfolio with technology stocks. I've written before on Seeking Alpha that the SMH semiconductor ETF should be considered as a core long-term holding in such a portfolio (it is in mine). If you don't already own SMH, you might consider the SMHX instead, or perhaps split your semiconductor allocation between the two ETFs. Heck, I already have a full-position in the SMH ETF, and instead of continually adding to it, I have decided to funnel future semiconductor funds into the SMHX ETF instead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, I know it's hard to invest money at lofty valuation levels. That being the case, I will give the same advice I have been giving with respect to my other primary AI single stock holdings like Google &amp; Broadcom: start by opening a small \"starter position\" (even if it is only 5 or 10 shares ...) and begin learning about the stock (or fund) by watching how it trades and by reading the quarterly earnings reports and listening to the conference calls. Over time, you will become an expert on the company and/or ETF. Then you will be much better prepared to take advantage of market volatility to add to your position during market sell-offs. Speaking for myself, during times of market turmoil I have always found it easier to add to an existing position as compared to opening a brand new one. Last piece of advice: be patient. It took me over 2 years to build a full position in Broadcom, but it was certainly worth the time and the work.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom line: I like the SMHX ETF and rate it a BUY based on my expectations that we are still in the early innings of what I see as a long-term secular bull market in the technology sector. And within the technology sector, semiconductors are the key to ... well<em> ... everything</em>.</p>",

The founders, two Lehman acolytes, earned a name for themselves by identifying market shifts early and converting them into profitable strategies. Today, Blackstone is the world's largest alternative asset manager, with assets under management (AUM) surpassing $1.2 trillion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Historically, betting against Blackstone has not been a profitable strategy. The same foresight that has made the firm successful in the past is underpinning their expansion in private credit and insurance. Despite this, many investors incorrectly price Blackstone as a traditional private equity (PE) shop. Unlike some peers that remain vulnerable to market swings and tethered to interest rate fluctuations, Blackstone is now generating the majority of its revenue from recurring fees, a durable and scalable income stream. This pivot from the traditional PE model, expansion in the C&amp;I operation, along with investment in non-REIT related projects, (e.g. infrastructure, and AI), are driving growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expanding A Proven System To Credit And Insurance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since Blackstone’s 2008 acquisition of GSO Capital Partners, the firm has been building out its credit related investment business. From 2008 to 2020, the subsidiary had grown from around $10 billion in assets to more than $135 billion in assets. In 2023, Blackstone integrated the credit and insurance groups into a streamlined operation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, BXCI <a href=\"https://www.blackstone.com/our-businesses/credit-and-insurance-bxci/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Blackstone Credit and Insurance)</a> represents AUM of over $508 billion, and generated about $36 billion of the $54 billion in total Q3 inflows. By blending multiple verticals, BXCI has become the firm’s fastest growing segment, doubling AUM in the past three years. Due to Blackstone’s sheer size and existing international footprint, BXCI was able to build on an existing infrastructure that peers can’t easily replicate. While most peers rely on smaller networks, and secondary markets, BXCI has a network of over 5,000 issuers, and 550 sponsors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BXCI’s strength is rooted in its insurance partnerships, including Corebridge Financial, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRBG\" title=\"Corebridge Financial, Inc.\">CRBG</a>), Legal &amp; General Group Plc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LGGNY\" title=\"Legal &amp; General Group Plc\">OTCPK:LGGNY</a>) and Everlake (privately held). These relationships provide a steady source of long-term capital, allowing BXCI to invest consistently across different market conditions. By centralizing existing credit and insurance units under one umbrella, the firm is able to offer clients a one-stop solution. The effectiveness of this model is reflected in the numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BXCI has zero realized losses to date and accounted for nearly two-thirds of Q3 inflows to Blackstone this year. BXCI products such as Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BXSL\" title=\"Blackstone Secured Lending Fund.\">BXSL</a>), and <a href=\"https://www.bcred.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blackstone Private Credit Fund</a> (BCRED) have consistently outperformed industry benchmarks, such as the Morningstar LSTA US <a href=\"https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-lsta-us-leveraged-loan-FS0000HS4A?currency=USD&amp;variant=TR&amp;tab=overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leveraged Loan Index</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Drypowder And Capital Deployment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Blackstone’s dry powder stores are estimated to be between $188 and $200 billion, nearly double peers KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KKR\" title=\"KKR &amp; Co. Inc.\">KKR</a>) (~$105 billion), Apollo Global Management, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APO\" title=\"Apollo Global Management, Inc.\">APO</a>) (~$75 billion), and Carlyle Group Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CG\" title=\"The Carlyle Group Inc.\">CG</a>) (~$90 billion). Blackstone represents nearly <em>10% of dry powder stores across the entire private equity industry</em>, granting them a unique capability to invest in deals that smaller players couldn’t access or afford. Blackstone has focused this capital deployment on high-growth sectors independent of rate cuts. Among these is their investment in AI and digital infrastructure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Blackstone has positioned itself as a leading investor in the AI revolution, with <a href=\"https://www.blackstone.com/insights/article/the-convergence-of-data-centers-and-power-a-generational-investment-opportunity/\" rel=\"nofollow\">over $70 billion committed</a> to data centers. The firm is also deploying capital around the margins of this new economy to maximize upside, including energy generation, and cooling systems. Additionally, Blackstone’s expansion in high-growth sectors such as Healthcare, and logistics offers less reliance on their real estate investments. For example, on October 21st, <a href=\"https://investors.hologic.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Hologic-to-be-Acquired-by-Blackstone-and-TPG-for-up-to-79-per-Share/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blackstone announced</a> its $18.3 billion acquisition of Hologic, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HOLX\" title=\"Hologic, Inc.\">HOLX</a>). This further expansion into healthcare and medical technology was enabled by their access to capital. Hologic’s existing stable cash flow and high-profit margins will be a welcome addition to Blackstone’s balance sheet, and the long-term growth potential of Hologic will be leveraged by increased R&amp;D investment. This summer saw the creation of a dedicated secondaries unit to complement Blackstone’s Strategic Partners group. This will give additional capabilities to this growing part of the business, which just closed a <a href=\"https://www.blackstone.com/news/press/blackstone-strategic-partners-closes-largest-infrastructure-secondaries-fund-ever-raised-at-5-5-billion/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">$5.5 billion infrastructure fund</a>. <a href=\"https://www.blackstone.com/news/press/blackstone-strategic-partners-closes-largest-infrastructure-secondaries-fund-ever-raised-at-5-5-billion/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SP Infrastructure IV</a> is the world’s largest dedicated infrastructure secondaries fund designed to capitalize on the growing infrastructure secondary market by providing an avenue for investors to sell or restructure existing infrastructure assets. Infrastructure AUM (industry-wide) is <a href=\"https://www.moneymanagement.com.au/news/funds-management/global-infrastructure-aum-hit-us187t-2026?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">expected to reach</a> $1.8 trillion by 2026, providing a large base for secondary market growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Divergence In Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the high-rate environment, Blackstone continues to outperform. <a href=\"https://s23.q4cdn.com/714267708/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Blackstone3Q25EarningsPressRelease.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">In Q3 alone</a>, distributable earnings saw a 48% YoY jump to $1.89 billion. As the private equity space faced years of muted activity in the IPO market, higher interest rates, and a 25% YoY decline in fundraising, Blackstone has managed to thrive, generating $225 billion in total inflows (TTM). To understand the value, it’s key to dig deeper into the stable and recurring revenue streams. Fee-Related Earnings (FRE) are the most reliable tool to measure the underlying business because of their link to AUM. The stability of these revenue streams is a great advantage for Blackstone, offering annuity-like consistency, rather than one-off windfalls. As of last week’s Q3, 2025 release, Blackstone has seen fee-related earnings (FRE) surpass $1.5 billion. Additionally, compared with Apollo (16.7%), Ares (13.4%), and KKR (7.5%), Blackstone has the highest ROE at 26.5%, showing the scalability of their current business model. On the earnings front, Blackstone has diluted EPS growth of 19.5%, and a higher forward dividend yield (3.46%) than Ares (2.98%), Apollo (1.63%), and KKR (0.62%). In price volatility, the 24-month beta (1.43) is below Apollo (1.84), and KKR (1.96). Among major asset managers, Blackstone has managed to maximize ROE, net income margins, and EPS growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Should rate cuts happen at a slower pace, or if inflation flares up, Blackstone (like most of the market) would likely see stock prices stall, and lower than anticipated earnings. Another thing worth watching is BREIT redemptions. While stable at the moment, the housing market pressure persists. Rising competition is also something that warrants caution, especially as peers such as Ares and KKR build up their own C&amp;I operations. Blackstone has the size and diversification working in its favor, but like any company, it’s not immune from market forces, and smaller firms can potentially erode profit margins.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Blackstone has managed to move beyond its early LBO, and M&amp;A shop days, becoming an integrated private equity, credit, insurance, and real estate behemoth. In recent years a pivot away from its traditional revenue model to the current fee-based structure has generated compounding value for clients and shareholders alike. With lower rates expected, BXCI’s AUM growing at 20% YoY, $180+ billion in dry powder ready to deploy, and its leading role in the AI revolution, 2026 brings opportunity for Blackstone to accelerate growth and earnings. Based on these factors, we see Blackstone hitting a price of at least $185 by Q3, 2026, representing upside of around 24% from current levels.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At Avalon Capital Research: we rate Blackstone Inc. a BUY.</p>",

Going to the cash flow, operating cash amounted to $1.13 billion, with FCF at $523 million. FCF was up +70% quarterly. This was backed by a higher working capital release of $171 million, which offset the higher CAPEX. Diluted EPS came in at $0.47, including impairment and restructuring costs of $65 million. This restructuring activity charge was $280 million in Q2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617622298965106_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1726\" data-height=\"710\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617622298965106_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SW Regional EBITDA margin\" width=\"640\" height=\"263\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617622298965106_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617622298965106_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617622298965106_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617622298965106_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617622298965106_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617622298965106_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617622298965106_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617622298965106_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SW Regional EBITDA margin</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fig 3</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our Upside Case</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All told, we see this as a market overreaction.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Value Over Volume Strategy Ongoing</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Indeed, the company is losing volume in North America, but the market is down by 3-4%. So, <span></span>Smurfit Westrock attributes 50 basis points of its decline to the value-over-volume strategy. The company is progressing in shutting down production capacity linked to non-performing mills and has already closed three paper mills. Indeed, top management reported: \"further reduction in the number of corrugated loss makers and continuing rationalization of inefficient capacity<em>.\" </em>The adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.2% is a positive sign. More importantly, <span></span>Smurfit Westrock's adjusted EBITDA accelerated on a quarterly basis, signing a plus +7% versus +3% yearly.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Supportive Synergies Ahead</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a negative note, the company reduced its fiscal year 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $4.9–5.1 billion (compared to a previous indication range of $5-5.2 billion - Fig. 4). This implied an adjusted EBITDA of $1.23 billion in Q4 2025 at the midpoint. Still, the company remains on track to deliver $400 million in synergies. During the analyst's call, top management explained that the cut is related to the weak US demand and higher maintenance ($180-200 million versus last year).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1842\" data-height=\"620\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SW new guidance\" width=\"640\" height=\"215\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SW new guidance</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fig 4</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global Footprint As A Key <span>Differentiator</span> </h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a global leader with a footprint in the EU and LatAm, the company benefits from diversification.

This is unusual, but we see a positive take here. 2026 CAPEX is estimated to be close to consensus guidance at ~$2.4 billion. Still, on a positive note, the company confirmed its quarterly dividend payment of $0.4308 per share (Fig. 5). </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1864\" data-height=\"852\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SW Capital allocation priorities\" width=\"640\" height=\"293\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SW Capital allocation priorities</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fig 5</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here at the Lab, we are deliberately not modeling a volume recovery or improved synergies in 2026. We had previously set 2025 EBITDA at $5 billion, which is now consistent with management’s estimates. We were not insensitive to Mondi's profit warning, so we incorporated short-term challenges, but this share price evolution supports doubling down on our entry price. We apply no change to our EV/EBITDA target multiple (8x), so <span></span>Smurfit Westrock's enterprise value reached $40 billion. Our EV/EBITDA is below Packaging Corp. of America's and Smurfit Kappa's valuation before the merger with <span></span>Westrock. Additionally, our target price is below the sector median with a TTM EBITDA of 9.99x (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SW/valuation/metrics\">Fig. 6</a>). Considering the current financial obligation, the company's equity value reached $26.5 billion. This represents approximately a 35% upside. There is also a 4.5% dividend yield, which is a total return estimate of almost 40% in one year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"686\" data-height=\"824\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA Valuation Data\" width=\"640\" height=\"769\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA Valuation Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fig 6</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is subject to similar risks as the rest of the paper and packaging sector, such as FX changes (which are relevant given Smurfit <span></span>Westrock's US industrial footprint and its euro reporting), declining consumer activity given a potential economic slowdown, COGS price changes (raw materials, energy prices, and chemicals), wage inflation, changes in packaging trends, and overcapacity. Supply-demand imbalance is a common downside risk across the sector. Additionally, given the recent merger, <span></span>Smurfit Westrock is also exposed to integration risks and lower combined synergies. Having said that, the company has a solid track record in M&amp;A.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Q3 print and call commentary reinforced our positive thesis. We’re surprised by the adverse share reaction and are upgrading Smurfit to a Strong Buy Recommendation. This call is not only based on a discounted valuation, but rather on the best opportunity to invest in what we consider the best-managed company in the paper sector.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VRRM\" title=\"Verra Mobility Corporation\">VRRM</a></span>) previously with a buy rating, as the business outlook remains positive, and given the valuation has become cheaper, I stayed bullish. For this update, I maintain a buy rating. My<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> view is still that this is a strong, well-managed business that is seeing fundamentals improving. VRRM has won the NYCDOT contract, which removes a huge uncertainty in the equity story. With new potential growth levers like new legislation changes in California, I would think VRRM is still in very good shape to grow for the foreseeable future.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3Q25 Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285135-verra-mobility-announces-third-quarter-2025-financial-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A1\">Q3 2025</a> results were very strong. VRRM’s total revenue grew 16% y/y to $262 million, coming in way ahead of consensus. The beat was almost entirely driven by Government Solutions [GS], which saw 28% y/y growth. The key catalyst was the timing and pull-forward of the New York City contract. In Q3, VRRM booked $17 million of revenue tied to a New York City Department of Transportation [NYCDOT] change order to install up to 250 additional red-light cameras in 2025. In that $17 million, it included $6 million from product sales. Remember that I’ve discussed this previously, noting this as a growth catalyst. It has surely played out nicely and as expected. For the Commercial Services [CS] segment, revenue grew 7% y/y to $117.3 million. The 3% decline in Fleet Management [FMC] was expected, as the customer churn was already disclosed in Q2 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of profit, adj. EBITDA grew 8% y/y to $113 million. This was below revenue growth because of one-time readiness costs tied to the NYC expansion. Some of the major cost items include developing a real-time camera health dashboard, cloud migration, and getting more subcontractor capacity onboard. These are necessary upfront investments to make sure VRRM is ready to win demand (like the $963 million contract opportunity), and hence, they shouldn’t be considered as recurring costs. Anyway, despite the heavier spend, adj. EPS still grew 16% y/y to $0.37.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The NYC Overhang Is Gone</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The outcome of the NYCDOT RFP was a very bullish moment for VRRM’s equity story. As I said before, this was an important growth catalyst, which could also be seen as an overhang (investors don’t like uncertainty). Thankfully, that uncertainty is now gone, and VRRM has been officially awarded the contract. What makes this even better than it seems is that this is not just a simple renewal. It is actually a large expansion contract with multi-year visibility. Here are the terms of the deal: the VRRM contract is on a five-year term with a five-year renewal option. In other words, VRRM has effectively locked in its largest customer for potentially a decade. The total estimated value for the initial term alone is $963 million. For perspective, VRRM's entire FY2024 revenue is only $879 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The scope of this deal is also very positive for VRRM. It includes the sale and installation of ~1,000 additional red-light and fixed bus-lane cameras over the next 2+ years. This matters for two reasons. First, it gives VRRM a sizeable sum of front-loaded, high-margin product revenue (NYCDOT has chosen to purchase the equipment directly from VRRM), which management expects will contribute $20 million to $30 million in product revenue in both 2026 and 2027. Second, and more importantly, this permanently expands the VRRM recurring revenue base. Each of these 1,000 cameras represents a long-term service stream that generates visible, high-margin revenue. Basically, the installed base has gotten significantly larger, and a larger installed base means more recurring revenue. Given this win, I think the GS segment can very easily grow high-single-digit to low-double-digit service revenue through the foreseeable future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Execution, Balance Sheet, And Growth Momentum</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond the NYC contract win, the rest of VRRM business continues to execute exceptionally well too. The CS segment continues to operate steadily, maintaining its status as the cash-generative engine for VRRM. In Q3, revenue grew 7% y/y, supported by a 7% increase in rental-car tolling activity. The key data point here is that TSA passenger traffic grew by only 1% in Q3, which means the growth was not a boost from higher travel-related passengers. This reliable cash flow provides VRRM the flexibility to deleverage quickly (net leverage is now down to just 2x). On this balance sheet topic, management has refinanced the term loan, extending its maturity by seven years to 2032 and cutting the spread by 25 bps. The focus here on balance sheet matters to some extent because the NYC contract win is good, but it requires heavy investments. The last thing we want to see is VRRM being put in a difficult position where it needs to raise debt or equity to fund this growth capex.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth momentum in GS, which I highlighted in my last update, is also accelerating. Specifically, for California’s speed camera program, which was still in its six-city pilot phase previously, VRRM has won its third award, with San Jose confirming its intent to award. With this win, it marks VRRM's third win following the deals in San Francisco and Oakland. You can start to see this trend forming nicely, that as VRRM wins more deals, it makes it more credible in the industry. Every win becomes a reference point for the next deal. I would love to think that this is the case, and if true, we should continue to see VRRM winning deals on this front.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Winning these deals is not just good for the financial benefits, but also because VRRM gains a “priority” seat when it comes to more services needed. Take the recent California legislation, for instance. The new legislation doesn’t just require a new work-zone speed pilot but also a complete restructuring of California’s red-light program, moving it from criminal to civil enforcement. This is huge because the 'criminal' term was a major operating barrier; in a sense, it was a political headache for cities to adopt due to high fines and the related legal process for drivers. This new change shifts the status from criminal to a simple civil penalty (just think of this like a parking ticket). This makes the program far easier to adopt for municipalities (they don’t need to go through the high hurdles of passing a “criminal law”), and this, in my view, should significantly accelerate adoption. For VRRM, because it is already in contract with California, it should naturally be the vendor of choice.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"780\" data-height=\"403\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A white sheet with numbers and a number on it AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>May Investing Ideas</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My updated model still suggests attractive upside for VRRM. My growth assumptions are the same: that revenue growth should continue to compound at a high single-digit percentage given the new NYC contract win and expanding opportunities in California and potentially other states. In fact, my growth assumption may be too low, but for conservatism's sake, I will stick to 8%. I have delayed VRRM achieving a 25% adj. earnings margin by 1 year to FY28 to reflect the heavy investments required for the NYC deal. One new change to the model is I am pricing in share buybacks. So far into FY2025, VRRM has already bought back 3% of shares, and I assume this to continue as VRRM has the balance sheet strength to continue. This gives us an FY28 adj. EPS of $2.05. Multiplying that by 18x forward PE (VRRM historical average multiple), I think VRRM shares can be worth $37 by FY2027.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main risk is from the front-loaded margin pressure from the new NYC contract. Management expects to see some margin pressure in 2026, and should the required expenses go beyond expectations, the unit economics of this contract may not be as lucrative. The deal also increases customer concentration risk. In Q3 2025, NYCDOT accounted for 19.5% of total revenue, and the top three CS clients represented more than 38%. Should any of them churn, for any reason, it would be detrimental for VRRM.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I reiterate a buy rating for VRRM. I believe VRRM’s fundamentals have gotten a lot better after the NYC contract award, one that enables it to lock in its largest customer for the next decade. The balance sheet is stronger, cash flow remains robust, and new legislative tailwinds are potentially expanding VRRM’s addressable market. While 2026 will see near-term margin pressure from upfront costs, I believe these investments will support higher growth and profitability in 2027 and beyond.</p>",

And I expect its margins to<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> grow faster than analysts expect, which means that the stock is potentially undervalued based on earnings multiples. Additionally, BJ’s can use its increased income to drive EPS growth in other ways, such as stock buybacks.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I discussed this thesis in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4816157-bjs-restaurants-might-become-more-efficient-than-analysts-expect\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4816157-bjs-restaurants-might-become-more-efficient-than-analysts-expect\" target=\"_blank\">my previous article about BJ’s</a>, but my call may have been too early. I recommended buying the stock at $35 per share in August, and its closing price on October 30 was $29. It appears that investors liked the third-quarter report, and after it came out, BJ’s stock price rose to $31 in post-market trading. But it might still take more time for this stock to rise back to $35.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20287298-bj-s-restaurants-inc-reports-fiscal-third-quarter-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20287298-bj-s-restaurants-inc-reports-fiscal-third-quarter-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" target=\"_blank\">its third-quarter report</a>, BJ’s reported 0.5% same-store sales growth and 1.4% overall revenue growth. It also reported $330.2 million in revenue and $0.04 in adjusted diluted EPS. It’s maintaining its guidance for 2% same-store sales growth for the full year of 2025, and early fourth-quarter trends are promising. Its third-quarter results were weaker than expected, but the restaurant does have a good explanation for this. It was facing tougher comps because of the launch of the Pizookie Meal Deal last year. But first, I’ll take a look at BJ’s margins.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">BJ’s Margins Are Still Growing</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My investment thesis for BJ’s depends on margin expansion, and BJ’s did report additional margin growth during the third quarter. Its restaurant-level operating margin rose from 11.7% in the third quarter of 2024 to 12.5% in the third quarter of 2025. Its adjusted EBITDA margin also improved to 6.4% in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The restaurant’s unadjusted bottom-line results also improved. It posted an unadjusted loss of $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, and an unadjusted profit of $465 million in the third quarter of 2025. It was only able to post positive GAAP net income because of tax benefits, though. It reported an EBIT of -$999 million. Either way, BJ’s is becoming more efficient right now, so that part of the thesis still holds up.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Full-Year 2025 Forecast</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BJ’s maintained its guidance for 2% same-store sales growth for the full year in the earnings report, but didn’t provide overall revenue guidance. Because the company’s revenue growth as a whole has been slightly higher than its same-store sales growth, I’d estimate that its full-year revenue could rise 3% to $1.398 billion for the full year of 2025. I don’t expect it to add any new locations in the fourth quarter of 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the third-quarter earnings report, BJ’s said that its revenue for the first <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"three\" htloopnumber=\"523114578\">three</em> quarters of 2025 was $1.044 billion. So, using the company’s full-year guidance, I can estimate that its fourth-quarter 2025 revenue will be $354 million. Its guidance also called for $136 million in full-year adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint, and with $1.398 billion in revenue, that’s a 9.7% margin. So, with $354 million in revenue, its fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA would be $34 million.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pizookies Are Still The Growth Driver for BJ’s</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While BJ’s posted weaker top-line results this quarter, this wasn’t just because of economic weakness. <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.com/2024/09/10/bjs-restaurant-launches-a-13-pizookie-meal-deal/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.dailynews.com/2024/09/10/bjs-restaurant-launches-a-13-pizookie-meal-deal/\" target=\"_blank\">BJ’s introduced the Pizookie Meal Deal</a> in the third quarter of 2024, so it was facing a tougher-than-usual comparison. This $13 lunch deal includes both an entree and a Pizookie, a cookie topped with ice cream. And it’s the reason why BJ’s still has positive traffic growth right now. <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BJRI/earnings/BJRI-Q3-2025-earnings_call-369389.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BJRI/earnings/BJRI-Q3-2025-earnings_call-369389.html\" target=\"_blank\">On the call</a>, management said that traffic growth drove the restaurant’s same-store sales growth in the third quarter. Its average check size isn’t increasing and might have dropped a bit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This restaurant also offers seasonal Pizookie treats, such as <a href=\"https://www.brandeating.com/2025/09/bjs-restaurant-brewhouse-2025-halloween-menu.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.brandeating.com/2025/09/bjs-restaurant-brewhouse-2025-halloween-menu.html\" target=\"_blank\">the Spooky Pizookie</a>, which was originally introduced in 2023 and has now been brought back for 2025. On the call, management also said that BJ’s has more seasonal Pizookies coming up in the fourth quarter, including the Monkey Bread Pizookie and a new Dubai Chocolate Pizookie.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Falling Alcohol Demand Is Still a Risk for BJ’s</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like other restaurants, BJ’s has raised its prices in 2025. In the third quarter, its prices were up 2% in comparison to last year. But that didn’t translate into growth in average check size, and one reason for that was because consumers ordered fewer alcoholic beverages. In my previous article, I mentioned that many younger consumers were avoiding alcohol and ordering treats like cookies instead, and that hasn't changed. BJ’s has an on-trend alternative with its Pizookies, but falling demand for alcohol is still a risk factor for the restaurant.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AI Scheduling Software Has Not Been Fully Rolled Out Yet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my last article about BJ’s Restaurants, I explained that the company was using AI scheduling software to reduce its labor costs. It’s using AI to forecast traffic and then using these forecasts to create schedules for its employees. In addition to reducing costs, the AI software could also deliver incremental revenue growth because the restaurant will be able to schedule more employees during peak hours.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While this software has already helped BJ’s become more efficient, the company hasn’t fully rolled out this AI scheduling software yet. <span>M</span>anagement explained that 30% of BJ’s locations would be using the software by the end of 2025. So this software isn’t just driving current margin expansion, it’s also likely to produce additional margin growth in 2026 as it gets installed at more restaurants.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Updated Valuation For BJ’s</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I used a different valuation method for BJ’s in my previous article than I’ve been using in my more recent articles. So, in this article, I’ll also recalculate what I expect its share price to be in 2026. Earlier in this article, I estimated that BJ’s would report $1.398 billion in revenue for the full year of 2025. It guided for $136 million in adjusted EBITDA, which is a 9.7% adjusted EBITDA margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It sounds like the third quarter’s results were weaker than usual because of last year’s Pizookie Meal Deal launch, and preliminary fourth-quarter results are better. So I’ll project that BJ’s reports 2% same-store sales growth and 3% overall revenue growth in 2026. BJ’s has around 200 restaurants right now. On the call, management said that BJ’s might add <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"two\" htloopnumber=\"523114578\">two</em> new locations in the second half of 2026, so I’d also add 0.5% revenue growth because of that factor. With 3.5% revenue growth in 2026, BJ’s revenue would rise to $1.447 billion. And with a 9.7% EBITDA margin, its EBITDA would be $140 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the market close on October 30, but before its post-market rally after earnings came out, BJ’s had a forward EV/EBITDA of 8.31. This was below the 10.39 median for the consumer discretionary sector. If BJ’s had a 2026 EV/EBITDA of 9 and an EBITDA of $140 million, its EV would be $1.26 billion. If you subtract $478 million in debt and add $26 million in cash, its market cap would be $808 million in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BJ’s has also reduced its diluted share count from 23.8 million to 23.4 million this year with share buybacks, and it’s planning to <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"523114578\">buy</em> back more shares. So I’d estimate that it will have 23.0 million shares in 2026. With a market cap of $808 million and 23.0 million shares, my new target price for BJ’s would be $35 per share in 2026. On October 30, its closing price was $29 per share, but its post-market price after its earnings report came out was $31 per share. So, my target price is 13% higher than the post-market price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BJ’s still has several growth drivers, such as its Pizookie Meal Deal and its limited-time, seasonal Pizookies. And it did face tougher comps this quarter. So, I think it will still report rising sales in 2026, but might not grow as fast as I originally expected, and that means its earnings won’t grow as fast as I expected either. Additionally, I also changed the valuation method I was using since I wrote my last article on BJ’s, but its stock price has fallen since then as well. At a price of $31, I still think it’s a <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"523114578\">buy</em>.</p>",

The increasing demand for quick and easy credit created a lending industry characterized by fraudulent operators and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> questionable business practices. Years of regulation — which ultimately led to the shutdown of P2P lending in 2021 — forced existing players to change their business models substantially.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN and FINV are now among the largest fintech players in China. And although they both focus on technology-enabled finance, they followed quite divergent paths after the mentioned crackdown. QFIN rebuilt around bank-partnered loan facilitation and technology services, whereas FINV moved toward capital-light, fee-based services with a strong focus on international expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, both companies still generate most of their revenues in China and are therefore heavily dependent on its macroeconomic and regulatory environment. Recently, they were once again affected by new regulatory guidelines for internet-based lending practices. The regulation led to softer company outlooks for H2 2025, followed by sharp declines in share prices. This shift in momentum and slight adjustment to EPS revisions led to a downgrade in their Quant ratings — from Strong Buy to Hold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At today's depressed valuations, both companies again appear heavily undervalued. In my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824517-qfin-holdings-highly-profitable-fintech-trading-at-discount-valuation\">recent analysis on QFIN</a>, I already concluded that strong shareholder returns and an incredibly cheap valuation make the company an attractive buy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this analysis, I want to closely compare both companies' business models, operating efficiency, growth, and risk structures — to identify which is the better buy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business Models – Different Paths to Success</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The business model of QFIN and FINV is to leverage big data and AI in the financial industry. Both companies are specifically focused on developing products in the lending industry. Their products aim to improve the safety, efficiency, and speed of online lending, covering the whole loan lifecycle, including credit and risk rating, loan pricing, fraud detection, and post-loan management.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FINV operates as a hybrid fintech lender, primarily earning revenue from loan facilitation (matching borrowers with partner banks) &amp; service fees, guarantees, and net interest income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A small portion of FINV's loan volume is held on its own balance sheet. By doing this, the company is taking the full loan risk in exchange for the whole net interest income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN also acts as a loan facilitator, earning commissions and service fees. QFIN funds its loans through partner banks, trust investors, or its own capital. It also acts as a guarantor and runs a credit matching platform, connecting borrowers with its partner banks. Further revenue streams are referral fees and technology services. QFIN's management team considers these services an important driver of future capital-light revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"796\" data-height=\"231\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Table of revenue mix based on Q2 2025 data\" width=\"640\" height=\"186\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618770791455379_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">revenue mix based on Q2 2025 data <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A closer look at the most recent revenue breakdown shows how differently QFIN and FINV generate their income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN's revenue is driven by net interest income — accounting for 42.3% — showing that a significant portion of revenue still comes from interest-bearing activities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FINV's top line relies mainly on loan facilitation and guarantee income (together 71.7%), confirming its fee-based, capital-light model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Referral and post-facilitation fees are stronger for QFIN than for FINV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both companies generate a similar share of other and tech-related revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, QFIN's model appears more interest-driven and vertically integrated, while FINV's focus lies in diversifying its service-oriented business horizontally.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Metrics</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The borrower profiles of both companies show some overlap. However, FINV generally targets younger, new-to-credit customers, whereas QFIN focuses on higher-quality borrowers with established credit histories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618776677635775.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table of key metrics\" width=\"606\" height=\"285\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"606\" data-height=\"285\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618776677635775.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618776677635775.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618776677635775.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618776677635775.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618776677635775.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618776677635775.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618776677635775.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618776677635775.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">key metrics <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite similar cumulative borrower counts — <a href=\"https://filecache.investorroom.com/mr5ir_ppdai/475/FinVolution%20Q2%202025%20Earnings%20Release.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">36.6 million for FINV</a> and <a href=\"https://ir.qifu.tech/static-files/8bbfbe14-5009-4e23-8c66-6b337e443cc7\" rel=\"nofollow\">36.8 million for QFIN</a> — QFIN facilitates 57% more loan volume and accounts for an 81% larger loan balance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN's 93.8% repeat borrower share is also higher than FINV's 86.2%, underlining stronger customer retention.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN's average loan size is slightly lower at RMB 8,900 vs. RMB 10,056 for FINV, while the average loan term of QFIN is about two months longer than FINV's 10.3 months vs. 8.2 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN's average user acquisition cost is RMB 370 compared with RMB 455 for FINV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The data imply the following: QFIN manages to integrate its users more deeply into its ecosystem, leading to higher borrowing frequency and engagement. Despite similar borrower counts and growth, and smaller average loan sizes, QFIN generates higher loan volumes and outstanding balances.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FINV's larger but shorter loans generate less cumulative loan activity per borrower, resulting in lower total loan volumes and balances.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since financial partners fund loan volume, the idea is simple: the more loan volume they facilitate, the more fee income they generate. QFIN's stronger borrower engagement results in lower user acquisition costs, demonstrating its superior operational efficiency compared to FINV.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Geographic &amp; Strategic Focus</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN focuses on deepening its operations in China, whereas FINV is following a plan of geographic diversification. 21% of FINV's revenue comes from international operations in Southeast Asian markets, whereas QFIN is still entirely dependent on its revenues from China. However, QFIN recently initiated its international expansion with a pilot project in the U.K. Although the management team recently emphasized its strong commitment to global expansion, it still sees significant opportunities in its local market.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We believe the robust fintech infrastructure this market offers presents significant opportunities for us and are confident that our AI and big data capabilities will create substantial value by addressing underserved local demand. Meanwhile, we are proactively exploring additional international opportunities, and our commitment to global expansion has never been stronger.

FINV's entrance into new markets drives strong revenue accretion at the cost of earnings quality. QFIN, on the other hand, prioritizes efficient and stable cash generation over aggressive expansion, which it then returns to its shareholders through its massive repurchase programs, leading to strong shareholder returns and EPS accretion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of now, FINV's growth optionality appears more tangible, as they have already advanced in their international expansion and recently surpassed an international revenue share of 20%. QFIN, in contrast, hasn't yet captured international markets, and technology services haven't yet contributed significantly to revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FINV's growth strategy comes with higher execution risk due to the exposure to different legal frameworks, a higher fixed cost structure, and a lower borrower quality.

Although this is not fully verifiable, as QFIN isn't disclosing the financial impact of R&amp;D in its income statements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fourth, and certainly the most significant impact on cost efficiency, is the difference in how the companies handle loan risks. FINV provides guarantees to partner banks through its \"Quality Assurance (QA)\" system. The guarantees require FINV to deposit funds with its partner banks, making sure potential loan losses are covered. Meaning, each guarantee involves real cash outflow, binding FINV's liquidity until loans mature. Additionally, FINV needs to make provisions for further potential loan losses. These two positions account for 27.6% and 5.7% of its revenue. Presumably, FINV follows the practice of larger securities, as it helps the company to build and expand relationships with its financial partners quickly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN's outstanding efficiency stems from the fact that it solely manages loan risks by making provisions, representing 25.3% of its revenues. Unlike FINV, QFIN doesn't deposit collateral to partner banks. Instead, they are utilizing non-cash provisions, which don't require upfront payments. Cash payments are only required if loan defaults are realized, providing more liquidity to QFIN.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FINV records substantially higher QA and provision expenses, reflecting a more risk-intensive business model.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash Efficiency</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618792864910955.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table on operating cash flow conversion data\" width=\"532\" height=\"218\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"532\" data-height=\"218\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618792864910955.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618792864910955.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618792864910955.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618792864910955.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618792864910955.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618792864910955.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618792864910955.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618792864910955.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">operating cash flow conversion <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That also explains why QFIN is doing much better in converting operating income into operating cash flow. Both companies earn income from guarantees and net interest, but FINV consumes far more liquidity to secure it. While QFIN manages credit risk through non-cash provisions that are later released, FINV relies primarily on QA, which requires cash deposits and guarantee payments. As a result, QFIN's operating cash flows remain stable, whereas FINV's fluctuate more.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk Management</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618786551133156.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table of risk metrics\" width=\"603\" height=\"108\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"603\" data-height=\"108\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618786551133156.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618786551133156.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618786551133156.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618786551133156.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618786551133156.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618786551133156.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618786551133156.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618786551133156.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">risk metrics <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both companies maintained excellent risk management over the last years, despite the challenging macroeconomic and regulatory environment. The credit performance of FINV and QFIN remained very stable and almost identical.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance Sheet &amp; Shareholder Returns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both companies maintain healthy balance sheets. QFIN has moderate leverage, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 28%, compared to FINV's extremely low ratio of 7%. QFIN's higher leverage is offset by its more stable cash generation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both companies pay semi-annual dividends and have a history of increasing them. As of today, FINV's FWD dividend yield amounts to 4.7%, compared to 6.8% for QFIN. FINV's payout ratio is historically a bit lower, offset by a more stable dividend growth record.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to dividends, FINV and QFIN have consistently returned shareholder value in the past through buybacks. In H1 2025, FINV has repurchased 2.4% of its outstanding shares, compared to 8.4% for QFIN. Both companies have already authorized, but unused, share repurchase volume. Even though FINV is already returning a significant amount of generated cash to its shareholders, QFIN's share repurchase program is even more remarkable. In fact, the company currently has two active buyback programs. A regular one, and an extraordinary one, funded by issuance of convertible senior notes at an extremely low-interest rate of 0.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If FINV were to utilize its remaining share repurchase volume of $89.3 million, the company could retire 12.75 to 14.9 million shares, assuming an average repurchase price of $6.00 to $7.00 per share. This would represent a buyback yield of 5.0 to 5.9%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618789189760737.png?io=w640\" alt=\"graphic on QFINs share repurchases\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"528\" height=\"397\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618789189760737.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618789189760737.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618789189760737.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618789189760737.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618789189760737.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618789189760737.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618789189760737.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618789189760737.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">QFIN share repurchases <span>(Q2 2025 earnings presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN, on the other hand, still has $623 million in already authorized, but unused share repurchase volume. Meaning the company could retire around 25 to 30 million shares, assuming an average repurchase price of $25.00 to $30.00 per share. This would represent a buyback yield of 14.8 to 17.7%</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When combining dividends and share repurchases, FINV currently offers a YTD 2025 total shareholder yield of 7.1%. If buybacks were fully utilized, total shareholder yield would reach 12.1 to 13.0%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN currently offers a YTD 2025 total shareholder yield of 15.2%. If buybacks were fully utilized, total shareholder yield would reach 29.1 to 32.2%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today's depressed valuations, operational strength, and clean balance sheets allow both companies to return capital at double-digit yields. QFIN's rate of capital return is unique and represents an exceptional margin of safety for investors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Comparison</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both companies trade at extremely low multiples. QFIN is cheaper than FINV on key metrics such as P/E and P/OCF. Despite its excellent cash flow generation and shareholder returns, QFIN only trades at 1.9x its cash flows compared to 4.8x for FINV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618793808351777.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table of valuation metrics\" width=\"607\" height=\"282\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"607\" data-height=\"282\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618793808351777.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618793808351777.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618793808351777.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618793808351777.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618793808351777.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618793808351777.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618793808351777.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/54227218-17618793808351777.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">valuation metrics <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both companies are heavily discounted vs. their sector, with discounts ranging from 50 to 90% (see data for <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FINV/valuation/metrics\">FINV</a> and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QFIN/valuation/metrics\">QFIN</a>), showcasing the reluctance towards investments in China.

While the financial performance has been solid over the last years, new regulations and macroeconomic headwinds could continue to affect revenues and margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI-driven risk models heavily rely on data inputs. Any tightening of data privacy regulations could harm the companies' underwriting quality.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Company Specific Risks</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FINV faces a broader range of risks, as part of its revenue comes from international operations, which introduce FX and country-specific risks. FINV's focus on younger, first-time borrowers might entail higher risks in the future. The diversification helps FINV to reduce its dependency on China. But it also causes bigger operational costs, which, along with the cash-heavy guarantees, lead to inferior operating margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN, in contrast, operates almost entirely in China, making the company fully dependent on domestic regulatory changes. QFIN's income is heavily reliant on net interest income from bank-funding partnerships, making it more sensitive to interest rate changes.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Annual Percentage Rate (APR) CAP reduction</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Any shifts, such as the recently widely discussed reduction of maximum APR in China from 24 to 20%, would significantly harm QFIN. All future loans of QFIN would be affected, whereas FINV's international expansion would partly reduce the impact. Lower APRs would compress margins across all consumer loans. Both companies would likely need to tighten their credit risk standards, leading to a contraction in loan volume. Since FINV caters to a riskier borrower group, which is priced at higher average APRs, an APR cap reduction from 24 to 20% would exclude a larger share of existing borrowers than in QFIN. Given that FINV is already operating at tighter margins than QFIN, I believe FINV would experience greater margin pressure in such a scenario. QFIN, on the other hand, might take a bigger revenue hit, as it relies more on net interest income. However, given its strong margins and diversification of revenue mix, I believe its business model would once again be able to overcome these challenges.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, it's important to note that only a portion of the loan volume would be affected by the lower ARP cap. QFIN and FINV cooperate with large, regulated financial institutions that likely do not price their loans at the upper limit of 24%, especially for prime and near-prime borrowers. While it's impossible to model the effect of such a scenario — as too much information is missing — I believe negative EPS effects would be at least partly absorbed through future efficiency gains, buybacks, and restructuring of the competitive landscape.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investor Takeaway - which is the better stock to buy?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">QFIN's business model is characterized by remarkable efficiency, profitability, and cash flow generation. The company leverages its repeat borrower base and deep relationships with local financial institutions, allowing predictable revenues and integration of technological products into its ecosystem. A total shareholder yield of more than 15% and a dirt-cheap valuation relative to the sector and its own past offer a significant margin of safety in an uncertain environment. The stock has plenty of room to rerate back to higher multiples, more in line with historical averages. In the meantime, investors are generously paid to wait. Given the share price drop of 30% from my previous article on QFIN, I now upgrade my rating to a Strong Buy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FINV also represents a fundamentally strong company with a bulletproof balance sheet. The company is consistently growing its top line, supported by its international expansion in high-growth, low-penetration markets. Although its operating margins are improving, cash-backed QA ties up liquidity, turning its 'capital-light' revenues into an actual capital-heavy business. This represents a major difference compared to QFIN's cash-efficient provisions, leading to larger cash flow fluctuations and a lower ability to return capital to shareholders. Nevertheless, given the amount of cash sitting on FINV's balance sheet, I expect more aggressive buybacks in the future. Lastly, FINV's valuation is clearly attractive, but it doesn't offer the same degree of deep discount as QFIN. FINV's history of lower margins, shareholder returns, and a higher valuation suggests a narrower margin of safety, making the stock a more speculative buy currently. Still, for long-term investors — if FINV executes its expansion correctly — the stock offers geographic diversification into attractive markets, reducing dependence on China's environment. I therefore assign a cautious long-term buy rating. More short-sighted investors should wait for catalysts, such as margin improvements, a lighter QA system, an increase in the buyback program, or important macroeconomic changes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I generally like FINV, and I also own shares of the company. But, based on my understanding of both companies, I believe QFIN is currently the better and less risky investment.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXTI\" title=\"AXT, Inc.\">AXTI</a></span>) reported Q3<span></span> 2025 results yesterday after market. The company’s stock price rallied on higher revenue, decreasing net loss, and positive forward outlook.

Gross margin was 22.4%, compared to 8.2% QoQ and 24.3% YoY. Gross profit was $6.2 million, representing a 343% increase QoQ and a 9% increase YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue by channel was as follows. Indium phosphide was $13.1 million, driven by data centers and PON. Revenue for indium phosphide increased more than 250% QoQ and represents a three-year high. The increase is due to the company finally receiving its export permits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gallium arsenide revenue was $7.5 million, representing a 20% increase QoQ. The company attributed it to higher demand for semi-insulating wafers used in wireless RF devices. Revenue from germanium substrates was $640k. The company’s raw material joint venture earned $6.7 million in revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company shared a breakdown of revenue by geography and customer profile. Asia Pacific amounted to 87%. Europe represented 12%. North America made up 1% of revenue. Five large customers made up 45.2% of revenue, and two large customers made up more than 10% of revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating expenses were $6.7 million, a decrease QoQ and YoY. Operating loss was $384K compared to a loss of $6.1 million QoQ and a loss of $2.6 million YoY. Net loss was $1.2 million compared to a net loss of $6.4 million QoQ and $2.1 million YoY. Cash and cash equivalents were $31.2 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company forecasts strong Q4 results. It expects Q4 revenue between $27 million and $30 million. AXT will fulfill more of its backlog for indium phosphide and gallium arsenide.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current backlog for indium phosphide is $49 million. Market consensus for Q4 revenue is $27.5 million. The company will report in February.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Synergies</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data center applications and AI computing are driving higher demand for indium phosphide. Indium phosphide-based lasers and detectors for high-speed optical connectivity are also driving demand. The company saw historically high revenue for indium phosphide in Q3. The current process for receiving indium phosphide export permits is three months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s raw materials joint venture reported nominal growth for the quarter. The company reports that new Tier 1 customers are considering their materials for their supply chains. AXT admits that it is a difficult path to navigate for a company to source its materials. AXT says that it is well-positioned to facilitate demand and supply chain issues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company foresees increasing demand for its materials due to “massive AI infrastructure build-out” and “data center build-out” in the US and China. It believes that US hyperscalers are using its materials in their data centers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most important current synergy for the company is the possibility of it fulfilling its backlog and gaining export permits for Q4.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AXTI Stock - Historical Financial Performance and Valuation</h2> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p>Amounts in US$ millions*</p></td> <td><p>Q3<span></span> 2025</p></td> <td><p>Q2<span></span> 2025</p></td> <td><p>Q1<span></span> 2025</p></td> <td><p>Q4<span></span> 2024</p></td> <td><p>Q3<span></span> 2024</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Revenues</p></td> <td><p>28.0</p></td> <td><p>18.0</p></td> <td><p>19.4</p></td> <td><p>25.1</p></td> <td><p>23.6</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Cost of Revenues</p></td> <td><p>21.8</p></td> <td><p>16.5</p></td> <td><p>20.6</p></td> <td><p>20.7</p></td> <td><p>18.0</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Gross Profit</p></td> <td><p>6.2</p></td> <td><p>1.4</p></td> <td><p>(1.2)</p></td> <td><p>4.4</p></td> <td><p>5.7</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Operating Expenses</p></td> <td><p>7.3</p></td> <td><p>8.2</p></td> <td><p>9.0</p></td> <td><p>10.6</p></td> <td><p>9.1</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Operating Income</p></td> <td><p>(0.4)</p></td> <td><p>(6.7)</p></td> <td><p>(10.3)</p></td> <td><p>(6.2)</p></td> <td><p>(3.4)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Net Income</p></td> <td><p>(1.2)</p></td> <td><p>(7.0)</p></td> <td><p>(8.8)</p></td> <td><p>(5.1)</p></td> <td><p>(2.9)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Cash &amp; ST Investments</p></td> <td><p>31.2</p></td> <td><p>27.0</p></td> <td><p>31.6</p></td> <td><p>22.8</p></td> <td><p>24.9</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Receivables</p></td> <td><p>33.8</p></td> <td><p>22.8</p></td> <td><p>22.9</p></td> <td><p>25.6</p></td> <td><p>28.0</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Current Assets</p></td> <td><p>149.8</p></td> <td><p>145.0</p></td> <td><p>149.5</p></td> <td><p>158.3</p></td> <td><p>167.9</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Assets</p></td> <td><p>334.0</p></td> <td><p>329.0</p></td> <td><p>333.5</p></td> <td><p>339.3</p></td> <td><p>355.6</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Accounts Payable</p></td> <td><p>10.8</p></td> <td><p>11.2</p></td> <td><p>11.1</p></td> <td><p>12.4</p></td> <td><p>12.8</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Current Liabilities</p></td> <td><p>84.9</p></td> <td><p>79.5</p></td> <td><p>75.3</p></td> <td><p>74.2</p></td> <td><p>78.8</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Liabilities</p></td> <td><p>93.6</p></td> <td><p>88.4</p></td> <td><p>87.3</p></td> <td><p>84.4</p></td> <td><p>89.4</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Book Value Per Share</p></td> <td><p>$4.00</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Median Target Price</p></td> <td><p>$3.82</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>NAV Per Share</p></td> <td><p>$5.44</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Current Price</p></td> <td><p>$7.90</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>NTM Total EV/Revenues</p></td> <td><p>4.33x</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total EV</p></td> <td><p>424.27</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Market Cap</p></td> <td><p>323.64</p></td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr><td colspan=\"6\"><p>*Data from <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXTI/income-statement\">Seeking Alpha</a> and www.tikr.com</p></td></tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AXT reported strong financial performance for Q3<span></span> 2025. Revenue increased, and net loss has greatly improved. Operating expenses have decreased. Revenue has reached a historical high over the last eight quarters. The company expects demand to increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because the company supplies raw materials and substrates for data centers, its stock price has rallied over the last twelve months. Investor sentiment is extremely positive on the sector and anything related to data centers and AI computing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The price has rallied beyond the fundamental valuation of the company. Although overvalued, there is still room for price growth. Total EV is higher than market cap, which implies that the price could move higher to meet valuation. Forward multipliers, like NTM Total EV / Revenues, imply that the price is approaching, if not exceeding, fair valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my last article about AXT, I said that the price could reach $4 per share.

Each company provides hardware and software support for data centers. The sector has undergone a constant rally over AI computing and an increase in data centers globally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AXT and Applied Optoelectronics are unique compared to their peers because they provide raw materials and substrates for optical networks, like data centers. AAOI also makes optical switches. Both companies provide materials for other products besides data centers. CommScope Holdings, Cisco Systems, and NETGEAR provide hardware and software for data centers and other network solutions, like home and business. AXT has its largest footprint in China and Asia, while the other companies supply North America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AXT is underperforming compared to its peers. CommScope Holdings and Applied Optoelectronics are outperforming their peers. The stock prices are overvalued across the board, and some analysts worry about an AI and data center bubble. The stock prices have been increasing, and caution is advised.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Strategy and Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AXT is at low risk of poor financial performance. The only exception concerns the situation around export permits for its backlog. The company has made progress on the issue. Otherwise, the company sees widespread adoption of its substrate and raw materials into the supply chain for data centers. The company has firm plans to capture this growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Hold rating for AXT comes at a moderate risk. The stock price has rallied and could sink again. The long-term outlook remains good for the company. Their products are in demand, and the sector is experiencing positive sentiment. Compared to its peers, the company trades at a discount.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AXT reported strong financial results for Q3<span></span> 2025 and expects in-line results for Q4. The company is in the process of processing its backlog as it gains export permits for its substrate and raw materials. AXT foresees high demand for its products to continue to increase. The stock price has rallied over the last twelve months and seems a bit overvalued. I continue my rating of a Hold for the company.</p>",

My conviction lies in TZOO's good fundamentals and market mispricing on its poor margins. The company is fundamentally stronger as it has improved in<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> quality from its ability to increase operating margin from 2022 till 2024 and is working to monetize its free membership base. Moreover, TZOO has negative net debt and has high insider ownership with the </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/10294912\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bartel family's stake (36.7%) </a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">in page 10 of the Q2 quarterly report, aligning with minority shareholders. I set a 3-year target price of $24, with ~15x as my exit multiple for 2027E earnings at $1.60 EPS. I believe this to be conservative and would also imply IRR &gt; 60%, which more than compensates for the micro-cap risk.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q2-Q3 2025 Earnings Commentary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TZOO's Q2 and Q3 2025 results together reflect a consistent pattern of solid top-line growth paired with intentional, margin-compressing investments in its paid membership transition. In Q2, revenue grew 13% year-over-year to $23.9mil which was led by strong growth in both North American and European segments and a 33% revenue increase from Jack's Flight Club. Membership fee income also surged to $3.0mil, up from $1.2mil last year. However, operating income has dropped to $2.1mil from $4.0mil due to higher market and acquisition costs as the company aggressively acquired new paying customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By Q3 2025, the reinvestment trend continued: revenue rose 10% to $22.2mil while operating profit dipped to $0.5mil as TZOO accelerated its club member acquisition strategy. Management disclosed payback per member remains positive within a quarter. The higher membership fees (<a href=\"https://ir.travelzoo.com/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-2025-Presentation-FINAL-v2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">$3.6mil</a> in Q3 report, page 9) confirm that the reinvestment is working and driving future revenue visibility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q3, Jack's Flight Club remained profitable and delivered 12% revenue growth. Cash flow from operations was -$0.4mil due to reducing merchant payables and the company did buybacks of 148k shares. I think this quarter continues to be transitional and constructive rather than structurally bad.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Investment Thesis</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TZOO is transitioning from an advertising business model to a subscription travel club, which would unlock recurring revenue and deepen membership loyalty. I believe the market has not yet appreciated this transition and is mispricing TZOO due to short-term earnings compression and its micro-cap profile. The market has overlooked a combination of positive factors: an inflecting membership base, significant operating leverage, and aggressive share buybacks.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What the market has missed?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Membership Inflection: </strong>TZOO's shift to a paid membership since 2024 was transformational, but the market doesn't give full credit. In fact, TZOO has gained ~225,000 paying members in Sep-2025 based on $9.0mil deferred revenue (based on an annual membership fee of $40). This gain would provide recurring revenue, which would be recognized in subsequent quarters. Moreover, the unit economics are also very attractive. In Q3 2025, TZOO spent ~$40 to acquire a new member (page 5 of Q3 Investor Presentation), but they would earn ~$55 within the same quarter. This means that there is already a positive LTV/CAC in the first quarter. Subsequent cost would be minimal as the member is already inside the ecosystem while contributing to its revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59193936-17618370508035722.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Sales and Marketing\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"569\" height=\"454\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59193936-17618370508035722.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59193936-17618370508035722.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59193936-17618370508035722.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59193936-17618370508035722.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59193936-17618370508035722.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59193936-17618370508035722.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59193936-17618370508035722.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59193936-17618370508035722.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Sales and Marketing <span>(Q3 Report</span>)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is where the market got it wrong. They see the big marketing expense as a negative, causing EPS to decline. But they did not recognize the future incremental benefits. This means that TZOO is building a subscription annuity, which should warrant a higher multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Earnings Masked:</strong> The market considers TZOO as a no-earnings-growth company, as diluted EPS has dropped from $1.06 to $0.66 from 2024 to TTM Q3 2025. However, I see it as a trough earnings situation, as its true earnings potential is hidden. TZOO is essentially reinvesting into the business by increasing marketing expenses, and that increases paying membership count. Moreover, the business is also structurally higher margin, as in 2024, its operating margin is ~22% compared to 2022 at ~11%. Once the company has amassed a substantial number of paying customers, it would be difficult for the market to ignore it anymore, leading to a positive re-rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Buybacks and Insider Alignment: </strong>The market also has not fully accounted for the buybacks the company has done, as the total shares outstanding is ~8% less than last year. Moreover, the company has such a small float, and any institutional accumulation would move the stock significantly upwards.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I value TZOO at different angles. On a forward P/E basis, the company is trading around 10.5x, where its sector median is 14.3x and its five-year average is at 18.2x, which is a 42% discount. Moreover, on a forward EV/EBITDA basis, the company is trading around 6.9x, where its sector median is 8.3x. Thus, we can clearly say that the company is traded at a discount compared to its peer group and on a historical basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Comparing the forward EV/EBITDA of specific names like Booking Holdings (16.8x), Expedia (8.7x), TZOO's forward EV/EBITDA looks dirt cheap. On a price/FCF basis, using TZOO's TTM FCF at $10.8mil and having ~90mil market cap, this expresses a P/FCF of 8.3x, implying a 12% FCF yield. I would consider this an opportunity to accumulate at this level. Moreover, TZOO is still growing, but the stock is trading at distressed levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, by traditional metrics, TZOO appears undervalued. The likely reason it is trading at severe discounts to peers is because of its small-size and the short-term EPS decline. However, once the company is able to demonstrate earnings power, its multiple should expand rapidly.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Bull &amp; Bear Cases:</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Bull case:</strong> By 2027, assuming TZOO accumulated 700k paying members (~2.3% of its free base) with $50 ARPU, which would lead to $35mil subscription revenue ($50*700k). An ARPU of $50 is a conservative estimate, as a paying customer would already have an estimated $55 by the first quarter. Moreover, every quarter would have an estimated $15 ARPU, leading to an annualized ARPU of $60 per year. Thus, I used $50 as ARPU in my revenue calculation for conservative purposes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next, advertising revenue could also expand to $85mil as more members are added, increasing its negotiation power for higher ad revenue. Thus, by 2027, this would add up to $120mil annual revenue ($85mil + $35mil) and with 20% operating margin due to scale and lower marketing costs, EBIT would be around $24mil. Net margins may expand to 15%, implying $1.6 EPS with 11 million shares outstanding after shares buyback. At a 15x multiple, the company would have a target price of $24, which is ~3x of the current price. Moreover, as the company is small, there is also the catalyst of a private takeover or acquisition by a larger travel company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Bear case:</strong> In a bearish scenario, its plan to monetize and convert its free customer base may not be as successful, and as macro conditions worsen, its revenue would falter. With only the ability to accumulate up to 500k paying customers, this would only lead to $25mil revenue (500k*$50) with $50 as ARPU, and a decline in ad revenue to 50mil from poorer macro conditions. By 2027, this would only add up to just $75mil of total revenue ($50mil + $20mil). Net margins could also slip to just 10%, and EPS fall to just $0.68, accounting for 11mil shares outstanding after buybacks. Giving it an 8x multiple, would lead to ~$5.4 in target price. This means there would be a ~33% downside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, this is an asymmetrical setup where the upside (3x) vastly outweighs the downside (~33%). The bull case hinges on the company proving to retain and grow its customer base. Moreover, even if it fails, the company has a good balance sheet with its negative net debt.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risk</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some of the key risks to our thesis are that the paid membership strategy may not yield the conversion expected. For instance, TZOO fails to demonstrate enough exclusive value to its paying customers, the members would leave the platform altogether, and ad revenue would also be impacted. There is also competition risk from Expedia or Google, which may have better deal offerings or targeted marketing to reduce TZOO's appeal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, changes in data privacy laws (like stricter e-privacy and cookie restrictions) could also make it harder for TZOO to acquire new members through digital marketing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe TZOO offers a very compelling asymmetric setup where the company has good fundamentals, but the market is overly focused on short-term margin pressure. The Q2 and Q3 2025 results confirmed that earning softness was due to reinvestment into paid membership growth and not structural weakness. I see a 3-year target price of $24, implying an IRR of &gt;60%. TZOO is a BUY at these levels.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

Crude prices are sitting near the 10-year 2010-2019 average despite a major downturn. Natural gas prices have benefited from high-energy demand, and we expect them to continue doing well.

The company's guidance above indicates upstream earnings alone growing from just under $19 billion to more than $25 billion by 2030. At the same time, we expect the company's remaining earnings to continue their growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That combination will enable <span></span>Exxon Mobil to ramp up shareholder returns at a time when energy is in higher demand than ever and the company has an irreplaceable portfolio of assets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The largest risk to our thesis is crude oil prices. WTI prices are just a hair over $60/barrel, and Brent is in the mid-$60s<span></span>/barrel. While Exxon Mobil is profitable at these levels, at a more than 5% free cash flow yield, the company still needs future growth to justify its valuation. That's a risk in an economy struggling with tariffs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Exxon Mobil's earnings show that the company remains a profitable giant at a time of high-energy demand. The company has an almost $490 billion market capitalization with an almost 3.5% dividend yield and share buybacks that are even larger than its dividend. Despite that, the company maintains a manageable net-debt portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Exxon Mobil is continuing to aggressively grow. The company has seen surprisingly good results from Guyana and the Permian Basin, pushing production to almost 4.8 million barrels<span></span>/day. The company expects production to ramp up further from that time, crossing 5 million barrels<span></span>/day shortly.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That makes Exxon Mobil a valuable investment.
