Rodriguez/Getty Images Entertainment</p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"inline_ad_placeholder\"></div> <h2>A Quarter with Mixed Developments</h2> <p>The Honest Company (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HNST\" title=\"The Honest Company, Inc.\">HNST</a></span>) reported Q4 2025 results on February 25, 2026, highlighting balance sheet strength and early traction in its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4844205-the-honest-company-stock-reducing-complexity\">transformation</a> while setting expectations for 2026. Some<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> developments were clearly positive. Others indicate that progress may materialize at a more gradual pace. I focus my analysis on organic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, as these are the metrics that allow for an apple-to-apple comparison as the company executes on its transformation strategy. Below are the key developments and my assessment for them.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>1. Enhanced Cash Levels</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was the highlight of the quarter, as the cash balance expanded from $71 million in Q3 2025 to $90 million in Q4 2025. For a quarter where the company exited multiple channels and categories, this growth in cash levels is quite notable. Moreover, HNST is a debt-free company, and cash accounts for 35% of its market capitalization as of the close on February 25, 2026.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>2. The First Share Repurchase Program</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the company’s strong balance sheet, it <a href=\"https://investors.honest.com/news-releases/news-release-details/honest-company-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced a share repurchase program of $25 million</a>. During the conference call, management highlighted that they view the company’s valuation as low and that they intend to repurchase shares opportunistically. This is a good development and will likely act as a catalyst for the share price in the near term.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>3. Results Were Within Guidance Range</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For FY2025, HNST posted a 5.3% increase in organic revenue, which was in the mid-range of its 4% to 6% growth guidance. FY2025 adjusted EBITDA was $21.8 million and was in the bottom half of the guidance range of $21 million to $23 million. Though this does not qualify as a bad outcome, it suggests that growth will take time despite the pivot to better-performing categories.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>4. FY2026 Guidance Is Somewhat Underwhelming</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is guiding for organic revenue growth of 4% to 6% (Figure 1). It is also guiding to adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 70 to 150 basis points. Given that the company is dropping roughly a fifth of its revenue base to focus on categories with better prospects and profitability, this guidance appears soft. I view the guidance as conservative and likely to be revised upward as the year progresses.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>5. Accelerate Beyond Baby</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is focusing more on households without babies. This entails expanding into personal care products catered to kids and widening the wipes offering to better serve adults. These product extensions represent a natural evolution of the core product line, making it a low hanging fruit.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>6. Improved Inventory Management</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company aims to transition from two warehouses to a single location. This optimization project is expected to be operational in 2H2026. Management seems to be very optimistic about this project and the efficiencies that it expects to extract out of it.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>7. Diapers Likely to Remain Challenged In 20226 </strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Diapers account for around 30% of HNST sales and have seen significant headwinds in 2025. There is a trend of consumers moving towards lower-priced items due to economic pressures. This is a major problem for HNST, as its diaper offering is positioned as a premium offering. Also, there was an issue with Target (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT\" title=\"Target Corporation\">TGT</a>), where the company had to simplify its product offering. The issue with Target is behind us, but the macro headwind remains in play. The category is likely to register flat to negative growth in 2026. This would explain the soft growth in organic sales guidance, as the company’s second largest category remains pressured.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Figure 1: FY2026 Management Guidance</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720788702944093.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Forecast\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"510\" height=\"319\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720788702944093.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720788702944093.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720788702944093.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Compiled by Author using data from the company</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Share Price</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The share price of HNST has been on major correction for the past twelve months. The stock has fallen by 58.5% during this period and currently trades very close to its 52-week low. Is the stock ready to switch gears and start climbing upwards? Well, the transformation resulted in a reported net loss of $23.6 million, but that was mostly write-downs that did not impact the company’s fundamentals. As discussed earlier, the company was able to enhance its cash position, as it benefited from a favorable working capital movement as it exited some product categories and channels. The announcement of the first share buyback program is likely to install confidence among investors that bad times are behind us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Figure 2: HNST Share Price</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720789145119288_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1959\" data-height=\"738\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720789145119288_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Share price\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"241\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720789145119288_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720789145119288_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720789145119288_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/47737185-17720789145119288_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">HNST is trading at an EV-to-Sales (Forward) of 0.57x based on the midpoint of management’s sales guidance for FY2026. This is well below the consumer staples sector median of 1.52x. This shows that the stock has a lot of scope to rerate upwards once investors start believing that the transformation is on the right track. Thus, I share the same view as management that the current share price valuation does not reflect the structural improvement that is taking hold.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Macro headwinds and tariffs are the key risks facing HNST. The weak macro conditions facing consumers were heavily emphasized by management in the Q4 2025 earnings call. Given that HNST products sell at more premium pricing, the company could face slower sales than anticipated. Consumers could downshift to save money, and this leaves the diapers category the most exposed. Tariffs have increased product costs and will remain a headwind until Q2 2026. Also, the company is in the midst of a transformation process, and there are no guarantees that this plan would work.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that HNST posted results with more positives than negatives. Importantly, the balance sheet strengthened during a turnaround quarter. The company is guiding for improved adjusted EBITDA margin driven by a more favorable sales mix. The company is competing in categories where it has a strong value proposition and is looking to solidify its position. Given its low valuation, the stock appears positioned for a potential rebound. I maintain my Bbuyrating on the shares.</p>",

Conversely, stock selection in health care and financials detracted from relative return.</p> <h4>2 We capitalized<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> on market volatility in an effort to find new opportunities</span> </h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We took advantage of market volatility during the quarter to purchase several new fund holdings across various sectors. We also eliminated several holdings and used the proceeds to fund investments we believe have more upside potential.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3 Longer term, small-cap value stocks appear attractive relative to S&amp;P 500 Index stocks</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The price/earnings (P/E) multiple of the Russell 2000 Value Index has been at a historical discount compared to the P/E of the S&amp;P 500 Index. We believe this valuation represents a compelling long-term investment opportunity.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Manager perspective and outlook</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>In managing the fund, we employ an intrinsic value approach to stock selection. It should be noted that the portfolio is not constructed based on a short-term macroeconomic view. Instead, positioning is driven by a bottom-up stock selection process based on our estimate of intrinsic value, which is based on a company's future cash flows.</li> <li>We seek to create wealth by maintaining a long-term investment horizon and by investing in companies that we believe are significantly undervalued on an absolute basis.</li> <li>Given our focus on intrinsic value and our long-term investment horizon, at quarter end, the fund was positioned with greater exposure to economically sensitive stocks compared to its peers.</li> <li>Following the outperformance of large-cap stocks over small-cap stocks in recent years, we see greater long-term upside to intrinsic value in many small-caps compared to large-caps.</li> <li>At quarter end, the difference between the market prices of the fund's holdings and our estimates of their intrinsic value was attractive, in our view.</li> <li>Although there is no assurance that market value will ever reflect our estimate of the fund's intrinsic value, we believe the gap between price and estimated intrinsic value indicated attractive long-term capital appreciation potential.</li> </ul> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top issuers (% of total market value)</h4> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th> </th> <th>Fund</th> <th>Index</th> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>Coherent Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COHR\" title=\"Coherent Corp.\">COHR</a>)</td> <td>3.78</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Western Alliance Bancorp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WAL\" title=\"Western Alliance Bancorporation\">WAL</a>)</td> <td>2.75</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>MKS Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MKSI\" title=\"MKS Inc.\">MKSI</a>)</td> <td>2.60</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hudbay Minerals Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HBM\" title=\"Hudbay Minerals Inc.\">HBM</a>)</td> <td>2.23</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Globe Life Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GL\" title=\"Globe Life Inc.\">GL</a>)</td> <td>2.22</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Charles River Laboratories International Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRL\" title=\"Charles River Laboratories International, Inc.\">CRL</a>)</td> <td>2.20</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>NRG Energy Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NRG\" title=\"NRG Energy, Inc.\">NRG</a>)</td> <td>2.02</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Expedia Group Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXPE\" title=\"Expedia Group, Inc.\">EXPE</a>)</td> <td>2.00</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Webster Financial Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBS\" title=\"Webster Financial Corporation\">WBS</a>)</td> <td>1.96</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Saia Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAIA\" title=\"Saia, Inc.\">SAIA</a>)</td> <td>1.93</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>As of 12/31/25.

This volatility provided an opportunity for us to purchase stocks with what we saw as attractive long-term upside to intrinsic value across a diverse set of industries. At quarter end, the fund had overweights in more economically sensitive stocks than its benchmark and peers.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notable Additions:</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Charles River Laboratories: This leading contract research organization ('CRO') supports the discovery, development and safe manufacture of new drugs, biologics, vaccines and medical devices. It has a diversified portfolio with exposure to high growth therapeutic areas. Slower spending on biotech and pharma research and development has been a headwind to the stock, which gave us an opportunity to invest at what we saw as an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Globus Medical (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GMED\" title=\"Globus Medical, Inc.\">GMED</a>): This medical technology company specializes in musculoskeletal solutions for spine, orthopedic trauma and joint reconstruction. The company has faced issues with recent acquisitions, supply chain issues and weakness in its robotics segment, which together provided an opportunity to purchase the stock at what we saw as an attractive discount to our estimate of intrinsic value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ArcBest (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARCB\" title=\"ArcBest Corporation\">ARCB</a>): This logistics and freight transportation company operates less-than-truckload ('LTL') shipping, which is used for shipments too large for parcel delivery but too small for a full truckload. The trucking industry has been in a multi-year cyclical downturn; however, we believe ArcBest's operational efficiency and technological advancements using artificial intelligence ('AI') should position the company well once demand recovers.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notable Sales:</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart Industries (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GTLS\" title=\"Chart Industries, Inc.\">GTLS</a>): A global leader in cryogenic and gas-handling technologies, the company provides highly engineered equipment to support a wide range of industries, with a focus on clean energy and industrial gas solutions. The company is being acquired by Baker Hughes (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BKR\" title=\"Baker Hughes Company\">BKR</a>) (not a fund holding) in an all-cash transaction expected to close in mid-2026. We opted to sell the stock to fund other opportunities we believe have better upside to intrinsic value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mastec (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTZ\" title=\"MasTec, Inc.\">MTZ</a>): An infrastructure contractor, delivering critical services across communications, energy, power and water systems, Mastec is involved with the AI infrastructure build-out for fiber networks and data centers.

Stock selection and an overweight in materials also aided relative return. Stock selection in health care and financials detracted the most from relative return. Overall, performance drivers were largely stock specific.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Contributors to performance</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lumentum: Shares of this market-leading designer and manufacturer of innovative optical and photonic products rallied in the fourth quarter, fueled by apparent investor enthusiasm for its AI-driven growth potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Globus Medical: The orthopedic device maker reported better-than-expected financial results with strong organic growth and an increase in its forward earnings guidance. The company's recent acquisitions are expected to provide synergies that we believe should boost earnings in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Coherent: This laser company develops and manufactures optoelectronic components and devices. Its optical transceivers are key enablers for networking of AI servers. Shares rose due to surging AI data center demand, strong growth of networking revenue and expanding profit margins supported by a more focused, high-return product portfolio.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Detractors from performance</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AECOM: AECOM is a global infrastructure consulting and engineering firm that provides planning, design, construction and management for transportation, water, environmental, energy and building projects worldwide. The company reported better-than-expected earnings, but revenues were below expectations, driving the stock lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Crane NXT: This industrial technology company provides technological solutions to secure, detect and authenticate physical and digital assets. Shares declined amid reignited trade tensions with China. Though the company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue growth, management reduced its earnings outlook for the full year, which also sent shares lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PENN Entertainment: The company operates physical casinos in the US, along with a growing digital gaming and sports-betting platform. Shares declined after third quarter earnings missed expectations. The company's announcement ending its partnership with ESPN also seemed to dampen investor sentiment.</p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">References</h4> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Alpha (cash adjusted) is a measure of performance on a risk-adjusted basis. Beta (cash adjusted) is a measure of relative risk and the slope of regression. Sharpe Ratio is a risk-adjusted measure calculated using standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk. A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance. Information Ratio is a measurement of portfolio returns beyond the returns of a benchmark, usually an index, compared to the volatility of those returns. Standard deviation measures a fund's range of total returns and identifies the spread of a fund's short-term fluctuations. Tracking Error is defined as the expected standard deviation of a portfolio's excess return over the benchmark index return. The up and down capture measures how well a manager was able to replicate or improve on periods of positive benchmark returns and how severely the manager was affected by periods of negative benchmark returns. Maximum Drawdown is the maximum observed loss from a high to a low of a portfolio, before a new high is attained. Maximum drawdown is an indicator of downside risk over a specified time period. Weighted Average Market Cap is a measure of the average size of company held in a portfolio. The percentage of the portfolio invested each company, or its weight, is multiplied by its size (market capitalization). An average of the weighted size of all companies held is then calculated. Price/earnings measures the price per share relative to the earnings per share of the company while excluding extraordinary items. Price to book measures the firm's capitalization (market price) to book value. Est. 3-5 year EPS (Earning per share) growth measures the earning per share growth from FY3 to FY5. ROE is the Return on Equity that measures the fund's annual return relative to total shareholders' equity. This ratio evaluates how quickly investments can be turned into profits. Long-term debt to capital measures a fund's financial leverage by calculating the proportion of long-term debt used to finance its assets relative to the amount of equity used for the same purpose. A higher ratio indicates higher leverage. Operating margin measures the profit a fund makes for every dollar of sales after paying the variable expenses. Contribution to Return measures the performance impact from portfolio holdings over a defined time period. It takes into account both weight and performance of the portfolio holdings. Contribution to Return is calculated at security level.</li></ol> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p>Investment objective</p> <p>The fund seeks long-term growth of capital.</p> <p>Fund facts</p> <p>Fund AUM ($M) 8,173.74</p> <p>Portfolio managers</p> <p>Jonathan Edwards, Jonathan Mueller</p> <p> </p> <p>Standardized performance (%) as of December 31, 2025</p> <div class=\"table-responsive\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th> </th> <th> </th> <th>Quarter</th> <th>YTD</th> <th>1 Year</th> <th>3 Years</th> <th>5 Years</th> <th>10 Years</th> <th>Since Inception</th> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>Class A shares inception: 06/21/99</td> <td>NAV</td> <td>6.79</td> <td>17.64</td> <td>17.64</td> <td>21.66</td> <td>20.72</td> <td>14.64</td> <td>11.91</td> </tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td>Max.

UK Gilts and U.S. Treasuries outperformed, while yields rose (prices fell) in Europe and Japan. U.S. Treasuries bull-steepened, with front-end rates falling over the quarter.</li> <li>The Federal Reserve (Fed) cut interest rates twice over the quarter by a combined 50 basis points ('bps') to 3.75% in response to a weaker jobs market, with the U.S. unemployment rate hitting a four-year high of 4.6% in November.</li> <li>Other data releases were more positive, with U.S. inflation dipping below expectations in November and third-quarter (gross domestic product) GDP growth that surprised on the upside. Despite policymakers indicating, in aggregate, that they anticipate one more cut in 2026, futures markets are pricing in an additional two cuts next year.</li> <li>In the UK, the Bank of England (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BOE\" title=\"BlackRock Enhanced Global Dividend Trust\">BOE</a>) lowered its policy rate by 25 bps in a split 5-4 vote, with policymakers citing subdued growth and easing inflation pressures. The UK's Consumer Price Index ('CPI') eased to 3.2% in November, from 3.6% in October, below the 3.5% forecast and marking the lowest level since March. The Autumn Budget revealed a surprise £22 billion of fiscal headroom (versus the expected £9 billion), achieved through front-loaded spending and upbeat revenue forecasts ahead of the 2026 general election.</li> <li>December brought another wave of bond selling across Europe, fueled by rising expectations of a European Central Bank ('ECB') rate increase in 2026. The shift in sentiment followed Isabel Schnabel's remarks in a Bloomberg interview, where she said she was \"rather comfortable\" with the idea that the next policy move could be a hike. The Governing Council subsequently nudged its 2026 growth and inflation forecasts higher. In France, political uncertainty lingered as the government failed to pass a full state budget, relying instead on a stopgap measure to avoid a shutdown.</li> <li>Another key development in the quarter came from Japan, where Sanae Takaichi won the Liberal Democratic Party ('LDP') leadership race in October and was appointed prime minister later that month. Her victory took markets by surprise. In addition, the government unveiled a substantial fiscal stimulus package in November.</li> <li>The Bank of Japan (BoJ) raised its policy rate by 25 bps, to 0.75%, the highest level in 30 years, while signaling openness to further hikes. The 10-year Japanese Government Bond ('JGB') yield climbed above 2.0% following the BoJ decision, reaching its highest level since 1999.</li> <li>In credit markets, October was a big month of issuance in U.S. investment-grade bonds, which saw record October supply of $158 billion. Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) priced $30 billion of debt. This was followed by another major supply event from Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) in early November. Bond issuance to fund the artificial intelligence ('AI') capital expenditure (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAPEX\" title=\"Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Growth Fund 1.0\">CAPEX</a>) of hyperscalers is now a dominant theme.</li> </ul> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Public credit markets remained supported by formidably strong investor demand, driven by high all-in yields and low default rates. However, the credit market continued to be selective. CCC rated corporate bonds in the U.S. and Europe underperformed over the quarter. Investors are showing caution and avoiding capital structures that are most at risk of restructuring.</li></ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main positive contributor to fund performance was the overweight position to corporate bonds and bank loans, which benefited from income and spread compression.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the credit side, we actively participated in several new issues in the U.S., Europe, and the UK, while switching out of bonds that had performed strongly, which in our view had become highly valued relative to their fundamentals, to generate liquidity. We bought bonds of from AA rated tech issuers such as Google, well-capitalized banks, and insurers where spreads were appealing. These were new or increased positions in subordinated debt of these institutions, at yields in the 5.5% to 7% range. We continue to find the backdrop more conducive to taking credit risk rather than duration risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to the credit holdings, we retain a long position in high-yield credit derivatives ('CDX'), which was accretive for the yield of the portfolio. Our yield curve positioning detracted during the quarter.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Manager outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We maintain a constructive outlook for the global economy heading into 2026. Signs point to a soft-landing scenario: inflation has cooled considerably without a recession, and underlying growth remains resilient across major regions. The U.S. economy demonstrated positive momentum – third-quarter GDP surprised to the upside at 4.3%. Europe's growth outlook has improved from mid-year doldrums; lower energy costs and a weaker euro should spur some pick-up, albeit growth likely will be moderate (approximately 1% in 2026).

Attribution is calculated using gross returns before the deduction of advisory fees and considers differences in weighting for the portfolio and the index. This analysis aims to break down the portfolio's performance into different components to understand what factors contributed to relative return, among other performance characteristics. The analysis can provide insights into which decisions positively or negatively impacted the portfolio's performance and serves as the basis for this discussion.</p> <p>There is no assurance the stated objective(s) will be met.</p> <p>Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal and fluctuation of value.</p> <p>Foreign securities are subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations, political and economic uncertainty, increased volatility, lower liquidity and differing financial and information reporting standards, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.</p> <p>Fixed income securities are subject to interest rate, inflation, credit and default risk. The bond market is volatile. As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. The return of principal is not guaranteed, and prices may decline if an issuer fails to make timely payments or its credit strength weakens.</p> <p>Mortgage-backed securities ('MBS') may be more sensitive to interest rate changes. They are subject to extension risk, where borrowers extend the duration of their mortgages as interest rates rise, and prepayment risk, where borrowers pay off their mortgages earlier as interest rates fall. These risks may reduce returns.</p> <p>High-yield or \"junk\" bonds involve a greater risk of default and price volatility and can experience sudden and sharp price swings.</p> <p>Derivatives can be more volatile and sensitive to economic or market changes than other investments, which could result in losses exceeding the original investment and magnified by leverage.</p> <p>Industry and Sector Risk. Investing a significant portion of its assets in companies in the same industry or economic sector can make the Fund more vulnerable to unfavorable developments than funds that invest more broadly. A more concentrated portfolio can be susceptible to factors affecting that group and may be more volatile than less concentrated investments or the market as a whole.</p> <p>ESG Investment Risk: Because it considers environmental, social, and governance (\"ESG\") factors in selecting securities, the Fund may perform differently from funds that do not. ESG considerations and exclusionary criteria may limit investments in certain industries or sectors, and the Fund's performance might vary from similar funds that do not formally consider ESG factors. Information from issuers and third parties on ESG considerations, which management may use, is evolving and may be incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistently applied across issuers and industries. The risk that the Fund may be required to sell securities when it might be otherwise disadvantageous to do so is heightened when ESG considerations and exclusionary criteria are applied.</p> <p>ESG Integration: As part of its investment process, portfolio management evaluates ESG risks and opportunities (\"ESG Factors\") deemed financially material, alongside other investment factors. ESG Factors are among many considerations in investment decisions and may not solely determine portfolio inclusion or exclusion.</p> <p>Bloomberg Global Aggregate Credit Index measures the credit sector of the global investment grade fixed-rate bond market, including corporate, government and agency securities.

We'll note that longer-term performance comparisons favor the fund over the benchmark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">U.S. small-cap stocks posted a gain in the fourth quarter, according to the benchmark, extending a rebound that began in early April, but at a slower pace. The advance was supported by strong corporate fundamentals, a resilient economy, an ongoing boom in spending on artificial intelligence and the Federal Reserve's first interest-rate reductions since December 2024. Within the Russell 2000® Index, small-cap value stocks (+3.26%) modestly outpaced small-cap growth (+1.22%) in Q4. Large-caps, as represented by the Russell Top 200 Index (+2.99%), had a slight advantage over small-caps in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Only three of 11 sectors outpaced the small-cap-oriented Russell 2000® Index. Health care (+19%) had the strongest outcome and particularly shined in November. Materials (+5%) also posted a solid gain, while the growth-oriented communication services sector rose about 4%, benefiting from the transformative potential of generative AI. Conversely, the defensive-oriented consumer staples sector (-5%) lagged, as did information technology (-5%) consumer discretionary (-4%) and industrials (-2%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Industry positioning detracted from the fund's performance versus the benchmark, especially in health care. A non-benchmark position in industrial technology company Crane NXT (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CXT\" title=\"Crane NXT, Co.\">CXT</a>) (-30%) was the largest individual relative detractor. Shares of Crane NXT hit an all-time high in October. However, as the Trump administration threatened to levy steep trade tariffs on Chinese imports, reigniting fears of a trade war, shares of Crane NXT slid downward through year end. Aggressive U.S. trade policies threatened many companies exposed to the industrials sector, as costs become unpredictable and can disrupt manufacturing operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In contrast, a non-benchmark stake in micro-chip manufacturer Micron Technology (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU\" title=\"Micron Technology, Inc.\">MU</a>) (+72%) was the top individual relative contributor. Shares of the company have soared since hitting a low on April 4, 2025. The company is only one of three that specialize in high-bandwidth memory, which is increasingly in demand as technology driven by artificial intelligence becomes more prevalent. During the past year, Micron Technology's revenue, as well as its cash flow, have dramatically increased due in large part to brisk demand for its chips. As Micron Technology's stock approached our target valuation this quarter, we trimmed the fund's position to invest in other investment opportunities. </p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio Positioning and Market Outlook</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund's positioning among sectors remained largely unchanged the past three months, as we made only modest shifts based on where we found the best potential risk-adjusted returns and opportunistic ideas that fit our investment philosophy. Our investment process centers on being patient, taking a long-term view and comparing price to value with the hope of choosing undiscovered gems. When we evaluate a stock, we typically think about owning it for three to five years, looking past short-term noise and focusing on key fundamental drivers over a multiyear period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As 2026 begins, we continue to find many investments outside the U.S. to be attractive, given the valuation gap that exists following an extended period of significant U.S. equity outperformance. That said, in the U.S., we are finding some interesting opportunities in areas where prices have been dislocated due to revised tariffs and tariff policy uncertainty. We are focusing on companies that we believe will successfully adapt to a \"new normal,\" and where the market is pricing in a much more pessimistic outlook. In addition to identifying companies that don't trade at an excessive valuation, we seek those that consistently generate positive cash flow. When the market is narrow and favors only a few winners, we believe it helps us find compelling ideas that are overlooked, and thus provides opportunity for investment. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">References</h4> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Life of Fund ('LOF') if performance is less than 10 years.

It focuses mostly on small- and mid-cap companies, including overseas. Most holdings have share prices below $35 per share or an earnings yield at or above the median for the Russell 2000® Index. (The earnings yield is the inverse of the price-earnings (P/E) ratio; a high earnings yield means a low P/E ratio.)</p> <p>Our investment process is based on the belief that many low-priced stocks are mispriced. Mispricings are especially likely to occur in businesses that seem boring and out of favor or which require careful analysis.</p> <p>We seek to buy higher-quality companies with stable growth prospects that trade at a discount to our estimate of intrinsic (fair) value.</p> <p>Where the gap between price and value is especially compelling, we may invest in firms whose near-term prospects appear challenged. We cast a wide net, and many holdings are outside of the fund's benchmark.</p> <p>We invest with a long-term time horizon and global perspective, seeking to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns. To help manage risk, we look for understandable businesses that are resilient and growing, with honest and capable management, purchased at a modest price.</p> <p>Performance Summary</p> <div class=\"table-responsive\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead> <tr> <th></th> <th>Cumulative</th> <th>Annualized</th> </tr> <tr> <th>3 Month</th> <th>YTD</th> <th>1 Year</th> <th>3 Year</th> <th>5 Year</th> <th>10 Year/ LOF 1</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Fidelity Low-Priced Stock Fund</td> <td>1.64%</td> <td>14.77%</td> <td>14.77%</td> <td>12.02%</td> <td>10.52%</td> <td>10.25%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gross Expense Ratio: 0.87% 2</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Russell 2000 Index</td> <td>2.19%</td> <td>12.81%</td> <td>12.81%</td> <td>13.73%</td> <td>6.09%</td> <td>9.62%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Morningstar Fund Global Small/Mid Stock</td> <td>0.97%</td> <td>16.34%</td> <td>16.34%</td> <td>10.19%</td> <td>2.88%</td> <td>7.34%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>% Rank in Morningstar Category (1% = Best)</td> <td>--</td> <td>--</td> <td>47%</td> <td>42%</td> <td>12%</td> <td>8%</td> </tr> <tr> <td># of Funds in Morningstar Category</td> <td>--</td> <td>--</td> <td>177</td> <td>166</td> <td>150</td> <td>90</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p>1 Life of Fund ('LOF') if performance is less than 10 years.

Preferred stock is included as part of each company's net worth.</p> <p>Sales-Per-Share Growth measures the growth in reported sales over the specified past time period.</p> <p>Weighted Average Market Cap identifies the market capitalization of the average equity holding as determined by the dollars invested in the portfolio or benchmark.</p> <p>Weighted Median Market Cap identifies the market capitalization of the median equity holding as determined by the dollars invested in the portfolio or benchmark.</p> <p>Important Fund Information</p> <p>Relative positioning data presented in this commentary is based on the fund's primary benchmark (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INDEX\" title=\"Cyber Hornet S&amp;P 500 No Load\">INDEX</a>) unless a secondary benchmark is provided to assess performance.</p> <p>Indices</p> <p>It is not possible to invest directly in an index. All indices represented are unmanaged. All indices include reinvestment of dividends and interest income unless otherwise noted.</p> <p>Russell 2000 Index is a market capitalization-weighted index designed to measure the performance of the small-cap segment of the U.S. equity market. It includes approximately 2,000 of the smallest securities in the Russell 3000 Index.</p> <p>Market-segment Weights</p> <p>Market-segment weights illustrate examples of sectors or industries in which the fund may invest, and may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. They should not be construed or used as a recommendation for any sector or industry.</p> <p>Ranking Information</p> <p>© 2026 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved.

Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for mutual fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.</p> <p>% Rank in Morningstar Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category. The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1%. % Rank in Morningstar Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges. Multiple share classes of a fund have a common portfolio but impose different expense structures.</p> <p>Relative Weights</p> <p>Relative weights represents the % of fund assets in a particular market segment, asset class or credit quality relative to the benchmark. A positive number represents an overweight, and a negative number is an underweight. The fund's benchmark is listed immediately under the fund name in the Performance Summary.</p> <p>3-Year Risk/return Statistics</p> <p>Beta is a measure of the volatility of a fund relative to its benchmark index. A beta greater (le<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/S\" title=\"SentinelOne, Inc.\">S</a>s) than 1 is more (le<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/S\" title=\"SentinelOne, Inc.\">S</a>s) volatile than the index.</p> <p>Information Ratio measures a fund's active return (fund's average monthly return minus the benchmark's average monthly return) in relation to the volatility of its active returns.</p> <p>R-Squared measures how a fund's performance correlates with a benchmark index's performance and shows what portion of it can be explained by the performance of the overall market/index. R-Squared ranges from 0, meaning no correlation, to 1, meaning perfect correlation. An R-Squared value of less than 0.5 indicates that annualized alpha and beta are not reliable performance statistics.</p> <p>Sharpe Ratio is a measure of historical risk-adjusted performance. It is calculated by dividing the fund's excess returns (the fund's average annual return for the period minus the 3-month \"risk free\" return rate) and dividing it by the standard deviation of the fund's returns. The higher the ratio, the better the fund's return per unit of risk. The three month \"risk free\" rate used is the 90-day Treasury Bill rate.</p> <p>Standard Deviation is a statistical measurement of the dispersion of a fund's return over a specified time period. Fidelity calculates standard deviations by comparing a fund's monthly returns to its average monthly return over a 36-month period, and then annualizes the number. Investors may examine historical standard deviation in conjunction with historical returns to decide whether a fund's volatility would have been acceptable given the returns it would have produced. A higher standard deviation indicates a wider dispersion of past returns and thus greater historical volatility. Standard deviation does not indicate how the fund actually performed, but merely indicates the volatility of its returns over time.</p> <p>Tracking Error is the divergence between the price behavior of a position or a portfolio and the price behavior of a benchmark, creating an unexpected profit or loss.</p> <p><em>Before investing in any mutual fund, please carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses.

The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) enacted two quarter-point interest rate cuts, bringing the total reduction for the year to three-quarters of a percentage point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, corporate earnings again outpaced market expectations. Although volatility was limited for the market, individual stocks saw significant divergence in performance, creating what we saw as a very favorable environment for security selection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We expect Q4 earnings to remain strong, especially given robust holiday spending, while equity valuations appear elevated. We also anticipate increased volatility in the coming year, particularly in light of ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, the upcoming U.S. midterm elections, and divergent central bank policies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We expect the Fed to maintain a cautious approach, and for fixed-income volatility to increase as investors navigate uncertainty regarding the future path of Fed policy. Although short-term yields declined in 2025, we believe that elevated longer-term yields could provide an attractive investment. In addition, credit fundamentals remain stable.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Contributors and detractors</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund's equity portfolio outperformed due to strong security selection, particularly in the communication services sector. Stock picking and sector allocation—the latter of which derived from the fund's bottom-up security selection process—in healthcare also contributed. Security selection in consumer staples and real estate modestly detracted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Individually, Eli Lilly &amp; Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY\" title=\"Eli Lilly and Company\">LLY</a>) contributed to relative performance. Shares of the pharmaceutical company rose amid continued growth in its GLP-1 drug franchise. Also contributing was Freeport-McMoRan, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCX\" title=\"Freeport-McMoRan Inc.\">FCX</a>), a mining company that benefited from rising copper and gold prices. Alphabet, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) further lifted the fund's relative performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In contrast, Zebra Technologies Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZBRA\" title=\"Zebra Technologies Corporation\">ZBRA</a>) detracted. The developer of bar-code technologies produced solid quarterly earnings that nevertheless appeared to lag investor expectations. Also hampering the fund's result was BellRing Brands, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRBR\" title=\"BellRing Brands, Inc.\">BRBR</a>), a maker of protein shakes. In Q4, its stock fell amid broadening concerns about heightened competition. Further detracting was the fund's lack of exposure to Apple, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), a large benchmark component that modestly outperformed the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the fixed-income portfolio, which outperformed, the main contributors were an underweight in U.S. Treasuries and an overweight in mortgage-backed securities. However, overweights in high-yield bonds and asset-backed securities detracted from performance.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio changes</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund's equity and fixed-income allocations finished 2025 at about 58% and 42%, respectively, little changed from September 30. Within the quarter, however, the fund's stock allocation rose with the market's outperformance, leading us to reduce the portfolio's equity allocation to maintain our desired underweight.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We established 7 new equity positions and sold 3 stocks from the fund. Turnover moderated but remained higher than usual, reflecting our active repositioning to take advantage of stock-level opportunities created by market volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the fixed-income portfolio, we added to the fund's securitized credit, primarily through purchases of non-agency residential MBS and non-traditional subsectors of the ABS market. In contrast, we reduced the fund's allocations to investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"></p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">References</h4> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>It is not possible to invest in an index.

Fixed-income investments are subject to interest-rate and credit risk; their value will normally decline as interest rates rise or if an issuer is unable or unwilling to make principal or interest payments. Investments in higher-yielding, lower-rated securities include a higher risk of default. Foreign investing, especially in emerging markets, has additional risks, such as currency and market volatility and political and social instability. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities may be sensitive to changes in interest rates, and may be subject to early repayment and the market's perception of issuer creditworthiness. Liquidity—the extent to which a security may be sold or a derivative position closed without negatively affecting its market value, if at all—may be impaired by reduced trading volume, heightened volatility, rising interest rates, and other market conditions. The use of hedging and derivatives could produce disproportionate gains or losses and may increase costs. Active and frequent trading of securities can increase transaction costs (lowering performance) and taxable distributions. Please see the fund's prospectus for additional risks.</p> <p>The S&amp;P 500 Index tracks the performance of 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States. The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index tracks the performance of U.S. investment-grade bonds in government, asset-backed, and corporate debt markets. The Blended Benchmark comprises 60% S&amp;P 500 Index and 40% Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

For example, SCHD's Industrials weighting was recently 12.1%, while the S&amp;P 500's Industrials sector is only around 8.3%. Also, SCHD's focus on high-quality dividend payers often favors stable, established industrial and manufacturing firms (e.g., holdings like Lockheed Martin, Home Depot, and various machinery/transportation names), giving it a relative overweight in this area compared to the tech-heavy S&amp;P 500.</li> <li><p><strong>Domestic Revenues</strong>: SCHD also has higher <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/SCHD/comments/1jsj5cq/73_of_revenue_comes_from_the_us_for_schd_vs_60/\" rel=\"nofollow\">exposure</a> to US (domestic) revenues in general as compared to the S&amp;P 500. This is because SCHD consists entirely of US-listed companies (screened for consistent dividend payments and quality), which tend to derive a larger portion of their revenues from the domestic US market due to its value-oriented, defensive, and industrials-heavy tilt. In contrast, the S&amp;P 500 has significant international revenue exposure, historically around 40%+, driven by its heavy weighting in global tech giants like Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), and Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) that generate substantial earnings abroad.</p></li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Macro Factor 2</strong>: The Fed’s Great Unwind is only just Beginning</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The decade-plus dominance of US growth stock performance has recently started to shift as value-oriented strategies (such as SCHD) are recently the leading performers (see chart below).

More specifically, growing concerns about the dollar since the US fully ditched the gold standard, have accelerated post-GFC (and even more post-COVID) as both fiscal and monetary stimulus, now combined with “trade wars,” are leading investors to question the dollar’s global-reserve-currency status (the US government lost its “AAA” credit rating) and pushing them to invest in alternatives such as gold. This slow-moving but accelerating megatrend shift (with lots of noise) is another factor that should be baked into investment decisions (more on this later).</p></li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_1.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Econovist\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"568\" height=\"540\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_1.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_1.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_1.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Econovist</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>3 Easy-Alpha Strategies</strong>: To Win with SCHD</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So with those two macroeconomic megatrend factors brewing in the background (i.e. Trump’s “America First” economics and the broader US government’s disregard for the integrity of the US dollar), let’s consider their short- and long-term impacts on SCHD (in the risks section), as well as specific investment strategies to generate alpha and win big with SCHD in particular.</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p><strong>Qualified Dividends</strong>: Depending on your tax bracket, and whether you own SCHD in a taxable or non-taxable account, is one of the most straightforward ways to add alpha (defined as the excess return of an investment relative to a benchmark). Especially when you consider SCHD’s total return potential (price appreciation plus growing dividends reinvested) as compared to other popular \"higher yielding\" investments that often pay non-qualified dividends (sometimes more appropriately described as \"distributions\"), especially considering they frequently destroy their own share prices just to maintain those glittery big distributions that yield chasers love (I share a bunch of examples <a href=\"https://www.blueharbinger.com/cef\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>). For most investors (but certainly not all), qualified dividends are often taxed at 15%—lower than their marginal tax rate. And when you combine SCHD’s focus on qualified dividends with its focus on long-term capital appreciation (also often taxed at 15%—long-term capital gains tax rate for many investors and again lower than most investors marginal income tax rate), SCHD can be pretty darned attractive as compared to the unqualified, capital-destroying (often via return-of-capital-sourced distributions) sparkly high yields that often get way more attention than they’re worth. If peers are your benchmark—SCHD’s long-term alpha potential is attractive.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Owning SCHD in an IRA</strong>—Depending on your personal situation, it can make sense to own SCHD in an Individual Retirement Account (\"IRA\") whereby dividends are taxed at 0% (versus often at 15% if you own it in a taxable account). Of course, there is a whole science behind whether or not to own SCHD inside or outside of an IRA (the answer depends in large part on how aggressive SCHD is relative to your other investments). But if you want to outperform your peer benchmark, owning SCHD in a tax-advantaged IRA is a quick way to add alpha (it's called \"asset location\" and it can add up to 0.60% of alpha, according to this popular Vanguard <a href=\"https://advisors.vanguard.com/content/dam/fas/pdfs/IARCQAA.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a>).</p></li> <li><p><strong>A Quasi-Bond Substitute in your Risk Budget</strong>: A lot of investors long for the days of the early 1980s when a 10-year US treasury bond offered a 15%+ annual yield and the US government still had its AAA credit rating. Alas, today we’re stuck with lower yields and higher risks on treasuries, while the stock market is way too volatile for many investors’ tastes. But rather than allocating your investments to a traditional 60/40 strategy (i.e. 60% stocks and 40% bonds) you might consider SCHD as a quasi-bond substitute (it does yield 3.3%—almost as much as that massive Vanguard Bond strategy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BND\" title=\"Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund ETF\">BND</a>) that lands in almost every target date fund they sell), plus SCHD has more long-term price appreciation potential.</p></li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/42083106-17720552582891245_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1870\" data-height=\"1071\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/42083106-17720552582891245_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"JP Morgan\" width=\"640\" height=\"367\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/42083106-17720552582891245_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/42083106-17720552582891245_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/42083106-17720552582891245_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/42083106-17720552582891245_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Guide to the Markets <span>(JP Morgan)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like treasury bonds, SCHD can be a \"flight to quality\" investment during times of market distress, exhibiting lower beta and lower price drawdowns as compared to the S&amp;P 500 (thanks to the high-quality blue-chip businesses it owns). And some investors comfortably outperform a 60/40 benchmark strategy by increasing their stock allocation (perhaps to say 70%) but with SCHD—a strategy they view as more attractive than investing in the full S&amp;P 500 (which includes a massive allocation to volatile growth stocks). In this sense, SCHD can be a quasi-bond alpha-generating allocation strategy within their overall risk budget.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Risks</strong>:</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Macroeconomic Sensitivity</strong>: As described earlier, SCHD has benefited from recent macroeconomic factors (such as Trump’s tariff impacts and the fed’s monetary policies), but just as quickly as these factors have benefited SCHD recently, they can create headwinds if the economic environment changes significantly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Structural Underperformance vs. Growth-Oriented Investments</strong>: The <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/dividends-factors/dow-jones-us-dividend-100-index/#overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">index </a>upon which SCHD is based has strict rules (10-year dividend history + quality screens like cash flow to debt and ROE requirements) systematically excludes or underweights high-growth companies that don't pay dividends or have shorter histories. This has caused notable lagging vs. the S&amp;P 500 in growth-driven periods, especially since 2022 and in 2025. While SCHD can shine in value rotations (e.g. the strong start to 2026), it often misses big upside in tech/AI rallies. The opportunity cost of investing in SCHD has been very real. And if you want to pair it with a few growth stocks (for risk management reasons), consider my recent article: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4862619-alphabet-big-rally-ranking-the-magnificent-7\">Ranking the Mag 7</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Heavy Sector Concentration</strong> is another risk. For example, SCHD has a big overweight to energy stocks (see graphic below) as compared to the S&amp;P 500 (where energy is only 3.7%). And this concentration can cause the fund to underperform the market at various points in the market cycle. Also worth mentioning, SCHD has little direct exposure to real estate, as REITs for example, often don’t pay the pure qualified dividends that SCHD focuses on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/42083106-17719129989801726_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2000\" data-height=\"762\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/42083106-17719129989801726_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SCHD Fact Sheet\" width=\"640\" height=\"244\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/42083106-17719129989801726_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/42083106-17719129989801726_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/42083106-17719129989801726_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/42083106-17719129989801726_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SCHD Fact Sheet</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Interest Rate Sensitivity</strong>: High-dividend yield stocks often act like bond proxies whereby rising rates (or expectations thereof) can pressure valuations as investors shift to safer fixed-income alternatives.

For starters, Meta has announced major AI Chip deals with both <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/meta-builds-ai-infrastructure-with-nvidia\" rel=\"nofollow\">NVIDIA</a> Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) and <a href=\"https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1279/amd-and-meta-announce-expanded-strategic-partnership-to-deploy-6-gigawatts-of-amd-gpus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>). These were absolutely massive deals that are going to be instrumental in continuing the buildout of AI technology for a leading AI hyperscaler firm. Across all of big tech, the total spent on AI is <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-tech-set-to-spend-650-billion-in-2026-as-ai-investments-soar-163907630.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">estimated</a> to be $650 billion just in 2026 alone, which is a monumental figure that should provide support to many of the firms in the Nasdaq.

With the new Fed Chair nominee Kevin Warsh likely set to take the helm post Jerome Powell, it is likely that rates will continue to fall. In the below graph from the St. Louis Fed, you can see that rates are still near the top of their 5-year chart, and the administration has emphasized numerous times that they would like to continue seeing rates lowered.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673654268_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1333\" data-height=\"724\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673654268_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"30 year fixed mortgage rate\" width=\"640\" height=\"348\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673654268_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673654268_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673654268_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673654268_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FRED</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We believe that this ultimately will help to provide a boost for technology firms, as typically these companies thrive in low rate environments, where they can bring on debt to fund growth. This should be a bullish factor for technology companies, as long as they do not saddle on too much debt where their cash flows are unable to meet servicing requirements.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The US Government Remains Bullish on Technology</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current administration has stated numerous times that they are <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/eliminating-state-law-obstruction-of-national-artificial-intelligence-policy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">bullish</a> on AI in the future, and the administration has also emphasized that they desire the US to be the center of innovation and tech in the future. The government is also currently in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-eyes-pentagon-ai-program-trade-blocks-minerals-pricing-sources-say-2026-02-24/\" rel=\"nofollow\">conversations</a> about implementing large amounts of AI into their systems, and should continue to prove to be a tailwind for technology companies moving forward. This administration has also pushed for increased <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/24/trump-to-announce-data-center-energy-deals-during-state-of-the-union-00794834\" rel=\"nofollow\">energy output</a> to serve AI needs, and this should also help to serve as a floor for AI firms in general.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Strategy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund employs a synthetic covered call strategy on NDX. A standard covered call strategy would involve purchasing the underlying equity (in this case, NDX) and then selling call options against that equity. In this case, the fund uses a “synthetic” strategy, meaning that instead of buying NDX outright, they purchase options in a manner that yields similar returns to owning NDX. For the purposes of this analysis, we will assume that the fund just purchases NDX directly, as the returns generally work out to be the same.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below is a chart that compares the covered call strategy with a strategy where you just buy the underlying equity without selling covered calls. We used the following scenario for this chart:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Buy 100 shares of NDX at $100</p></li> <li><p>Sell a covered call at a $110 strike for a premium of $200</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673340995_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1730\" data-height=\"1000\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673340995_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Covered Call Strategy\" width=\"640\" height=\"370\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673340995_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673340995_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673340995_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764673340995_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Doodad Capital</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We see that the covered call strategy (blue line) can be better if the price of NDX declines or only increases by a modest amount. If the price of NDX increases above a certain threshold, your gains from the covered call strategy are capped (hence why the blue line flattens out).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This means that generally, when you invest in a covered call strategy, you are predicting that the price of the underlying equity will decrease or only increase by a little. If you think the price of the equity will increase more dramatically, then the covered call strategy is not for you.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s look at the performance of QDTE vs QQQ over the last year. QQQ is a Nasdaq-100 index ETF so it will yield the same performance as NDX. We do not use NDX here, as it is just an index and not a purchasable equity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764672784817_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1300\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764672784817_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"QDTE vs QQQ\" width=\"640\" height=\"222\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764672784817_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764672784817_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764672784817_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51119559-17719764672784817_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We see that both options had a very similar return. Although QDTE had better returns by 10 basis points, for most of the period QQQ had higher returns than QDTE. This is not a good sign for QDTE at all. For all of the extra effort to trade synthetic options and covered calls, the fund has only returned 0.10% more than if you just bought QQQ. Additionally, QDTE has an expense ratio of 0.97%, which is 5.39x larger than QQQ’s expense ratio of 0.18%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the future, we may see QDTE outperform QQQ if the positive movement of QQQ slows down or possibly goes negative. However, if you are predicting that scenario to occur, you are probably better off not owning either QDTE or QQQ.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To recap, if you bought QQQ instead of QDTE:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>You would have 5.39x cost savings in expense ratios</p></li> <li><p>You have no risk of gains being capped by covered calls</p></li> <li><p>BUT historically you would have missed out on 0.10% in returns over the last year</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sounds like a good deal to us.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Tariff Conversations are Back at the Forefront</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd6zn3ly22yo\" rel=\"nofollow\">new global tariffs of 10%</a> (with potential promises of 15%) being implemented, there could be an impact on the overall economy and returns for NDX. If NDX does indeed decline in value (or at least not increase significantly), then a covered call strategy could prove to be a better choice.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If this risk occurs, QDTE may slightly retreat a bit but will still pay out income to investors.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>AI Might Disrupt More Industries and Cause More Volatility</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we have seen with various AI announcements, such as <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4549697-wealth-management-and-tax-prep-stocks-sink-as-altruist-launches-new-ai-tool\">Altruist</a> launching a wealth management tool and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/23/cybersecurity-stocks-anthropic-ai-crowdstrike.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anthropic</a> launching a cybersecurity tool, there remain lots of disruption events in the field of technology. This can cause stocks to react negatively to the news, and this might cause near-term negative swings and volatility in the underlying index.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For short-term swings on AI risks, QDTE will experience less volatility than QQQ, for instance, and will still be able to pay distributions to investors for income.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Technology companies as an investment are facing an era where growth should be strong and investments across public and private sectors should be tremendous. There is significant innovation and development occurring in the AI and tech sectors, and the underlying companies of the Nasdaq 100 should benefit from these tailwinds. We believe tech companies are a fantastic place for growth capital for the long run.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, QDTE is simply the wrong path to go down. If you are bullish on NDX and big tech like we are, we recommend a non-covered call strategy (like QQQ) where your returns are not capped. We saw in the historical comparison that QDTE has provided no real marginal value to investors compared to a simple buy-and-hold strategy on NDX. We advise you to not burn any unnecessary calories nor pay any unnecessary fees and just buy a standard, cheap, big tech ETF.</p>",

The goal of these meetings is to settle long-term concerns over Iran's nuclear program and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to prevent the US from launching new military strikes. This is happening at a tense time, as the US has been significantly increasing its military presence in the Middle East.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On Thursday, the two sides met in Switzerland for two separate sessions (one in the morning and one in the afternoon). However, they didn't speak directly; instead, officials from Oman acted as go-betweens, passing messages back and forth between:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Iran's side:</strong> Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The U.S. side:</strong> Envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before the talks ended, a high-ranking Iranian official told Reuters that a basic deal is possible but only if the US stops mixing nuclear arguments with other, unrelated disagreements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We finally heard from the Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi a short while ago, who stated, \"Today was one of the best, most serious &amp; longest rounds of negotiations. We made good progress &amp; seriously engaged with elements of a deal regarding both #nuclear &amp; sanctions issues. We are close to an understanding on some issues, though differences remain on others.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The developments have also been having a massive impact on oil prices as well as haven demand, as it is another layer of uncertainty for market participants to consider.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What happens next?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Consultations:</strong> Officials from both countries are heading back to their capitals to discuss the progress.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Future Meetings:</strong> Formal negotiations will start again soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Technical Talks:</strong> Experts are scheduled to meet in Vienna next week to work on the specific details.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi shared the update on X (formerly Twitter) after the most recent round of talks in Switzerland ended.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall risk sentiment does not appear to have been affected that much, with AI still the dominant theme, especially for equity markets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why did oil prices jump then fall?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to the oil market, one that has been affected by the US military buildup in the Middle East, prices were largely flat after some whipsaw price action earlier in the day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Prices actually spiked by more than a dollar earlier in the day. This happened because reports suggested the talks had hit a wall. Specifically, the U.S. was reportedly demanding two things that Iran didn't like:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>That Iran stop all uranium enrichment.</li> <li>That Iran hand over all its highly enriched uranium to the U.S.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, once Oman announced that \"significant progress\" was actually being made, prices dropped back down and lost most of those gains. Market participants are laser-focused on these talks. Here are the basic rules they are likely following right now:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>If talks fail: </strong>Traders worry about war or supply problems in the Middle East, which makes oil more expensive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>If talks succeed:</strong> The risk of conflict goes down, which causes a sell-off and lowers prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, though, key support rests at the 62.66 handle (200-day MA) before the 61.67 and the 100-day MA 60.27 come into focus. A move higher from here in oil prices faces a test at the 66.15 handle before the 67.00 handle comes into play.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>WTI Crude Oil Daily Chart, February 26, 2026</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_USOIL_2026-02-26_20-18-40.width-1400.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1400\" data-height=\"814\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_USOIL_2026-02-26_20-18-40.width-1400.png?io=w640\" alt=\"WTI Crude Oil Daily Chart, February 26, 2026\" width=\"1280\" height=\"744\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_USOIL_2026-02-26_20-18-40.width-1400.png?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_USOIL_2026-02-26_20-18-40.width-1400.png?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_USOIL_2026-02-26_20-18-40.width-1400.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_USOIL_2026-02-26_20-18-40.width-1400.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_USOIL_2026-02-26_20-18-40.width-1400.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_USOIL_2026-02-26_20-18-40.width-1400.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_USOIL_2026-02-26_20-18-40.width-1400.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source:Tradingview</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><a href=\"https://www.marketpulse.com/markets/us-iran-talks-advance-iranian-fm-confirms-progress-on-nuclear-and-sanctions-issues-oil-prices-steady/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Original Post</a></em></p>",
