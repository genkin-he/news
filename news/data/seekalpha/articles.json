(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a></span>) deserves a Strong Buy rating, and I'll tell you why right away. I've spoken to several analysts and portfolio managers in recent weeks, who are somewhat skeptical of its strong<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> AI spending. Amazon has increased this spending, so I expect even more skepticism or fear that something might break.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see it differently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, that spending corresponds to the current moat, a competitive moat that transforms AWS, retail, and advertising into a single growth engine. This spending can be compared to a wall being quietly built with billions of dollars. A wall that serves as a barrier to entry for potential new players. If we then raise this wall with cash and not leverage, all the better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"602\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Agar Capital, Trading View\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619228139268084_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Agar Capital, Trading View</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWS, which has worried everyone recently, has returned to growth at 20%, and believe me, this isn't an isolated case or a stroke of luck, but rather a capacity for expansion and the company's ability to adopt AI solutions that can be monetized on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a>. Extraordinary expenses weighed negatively on the whole, obscuring the real leverage in North America.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, there are AI tools like Rufus and the seller suite drive conversions. We're here, we're in the era of AI that monetizes. It's a reality. There are undoubtedly risks. I address them in the dedicated section below, but at the moment I see more upside potential than downside risks. At these levels, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511697-amazon-surges-after-q3-beat-driven-by-aws-ad-growth-offsetting-margin-pressures\">despite the market's post-results reaction</a>, the asymmetry remains favorable. In the long term, I remain positive on the stock and my TP is set within the <em>$269-$286 range.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When the quarterly results were released, I looked at the results, saw the after-hours reaction, and closed everything. I was calm; I had the stock in my portfolio, and I would have calmly dedicated myself to poring over the financial statements. Then Apple arrived, and I was surprised by its market reaction (first a 5% selloff and then an 8% recovery from the low).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I said to myself: we urgently need to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835961-apple-q3-stocks-crash-then-rise-why-rating-upgrade\">understand what's happening</a> with Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>). Amazon, on the other hand, is calm. With a cool head, I started analyzing the stock, and I don't want to bore you with an endless list of financial data. I arrived the next day to write this piece, and in the meantime, even better analysts than me have already analyzed the numbers and highlighted what worked and what didn't. Furthermore, I must say that Seeking Alpha does an excellent job of promptly reporting every company result, so the details are here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The battle for supremacy in the coming years won't be decided by the most beautiful and brilliant software, the one that does the fastest calculations. I feel like I've said that often. The real winners will be energy stocks (especially nuclear, for example) and chipmakers. In this entire context, Amazon is playing its digital industrial game, increasing capacity, dedicated clusters (Trainium2/Rainier), and expanding order visibility. In all of this, many see capex as a problem, but I see a player buying up compute shares before competitors. It's doing what a shark (or whale) should do: eating everything before the others arrive. Sure, you might get upset sometimes, but in the meantime, you'll be full. The others will starve.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'll start by saying that the <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Webslides_Q325.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">published numbers</a>, viewed as they are, don't really tell the story of the quarter. They include one-off costs (such as the FTC fine and severance packages) that make retail margins appear worse than they actually are. If we eliminate these exogenous factors, the situation changes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"102\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"65\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619213817446604_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Amazon</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/AMZN-Q3-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a>, the retail margin appears to be slowing, but in reality, it's a matter of perspective because North America is back where it belongs, with a 6.9% operating margin on $106.3B of sales, not the 4.5% you see at a glance.

I'm not advocating pretending these cost items are not there. Companies naturally come across events of this kind; certainly, income statement is impacted. The question is distinct: how many yearly times do they manifest themselves? Are they \"business as usual\"? I don't think so. What I'm trying to say is that to see the long term, it might be useful to separate and clean up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We have achieved actual monetization on the front lines of artificial intelligence. It's concrete rather than marketing. While the Ads department is extending reach beyond the Amazon ecosystem and sustaining very high margins, the <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-rufus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rufus assistant</a> is boosting conversions and frequency of purchase. And so, more demand generated inside, less reliance on outside referrals, and clearer and more environmentally friendly retail profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"63\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"40\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619214012755244_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Amazon</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AWS segment growing by 20% is what I call the \"<em>second cycle</em>\" (AI compute and capacity growth). The backlog is significant, and the new clusters—CPUs, GPUs, memory, storage, high-speed networking—are filling up rapidly, and that's the main point. So, we're talking about a phase in which AI is starting to truly monetize and become part of existing business processes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'd also like to point out another aspect that I found interesting. Did they mention the tariff issue? No reference in calls; not because they don't exist but rather because the model is immune already (local network, stable 3P mix, high-margin ADS).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last point: capex. I mentioned it in the introductory part of the article. Some see AI investments as a huge waste of resources, or simply too excessive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"783\" data-height=\"494\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Agar Capital\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"404\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/55096224-17619217435192192_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Agar Capital</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some build ratios based on GDP, make comparisons with 2000, then go back a few years, adjusting for inflation. In short, there's been a lot of talk lately. For me, capex is simply a barrier, and I'm happy that companies like Amazon want to defend their technological dominance by spending today and reaping tomorrow. As an investor, I'm happy. Those who build first, monetize first. The only thing I'd ask management is the utilization rate of new clusters and ramp times.

Essentially, the stock continues to rise, while the multiple compresses by about 7%, so the performance was earnings-driven, not re-rating-driven. I don't know if I'm explaining myself, but it's a crucial piece of the puzzle. It's obvious that at these valuations, it's difficult to buy everything in the stock—not even I would—but as long as price growth is driven by earnings growth, there's little to argue about.

That first steep leg up comes as the announcement of the agreement is made, and then a peak shortly after it's signed (traders \"selling the news\"). All in all, a good thing.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_c42905e7f00bda190b4cee68583cb3a3.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_c42905e7f00bda190b4cee68583cb3a3.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_c42905e7f00bda190b4cee68583cb3a3.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_c42905e7f00bda190b4cee68583cb3a3.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_c42905e7f00bda190b4cee68583cb3a3.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_c42905e7f00bda190b4cee68583cb3a3.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_c42905e7f00bda190b4cee68583cb3a3.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_c42905e7f00bda190b4cee68583cb3a3.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_c42905e7f00bda190b4cee68583cb3a3.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Real Reason to Make the Trip</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This visit to Malaysia coincided with the 13th annual Association of South-East Nations (\"ASEAN\") conference being held, which Trump also attended.

Critical mineral MOUs were signed with Malaysia and Thailand, and a potential deal with Brazil was ironed out on the sidelines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Brazil is of importance here because they have been stepping in to provide China with food exports while they have been forgoing US soybeans in protest of trade policy changes. China does not produce as much food as it consumes and so relies on these exports to sustain its population. Initially in April, the US was hoping to use this food export reliance as leverage in trade negotiations with China, but it fell flat when Brazil was able to step in and fill the gap. A deal with Lula will be helpful to Trump because Brazilian cooperation is essential for the China containment policy to work.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1000\" data-height=\"507\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Soybean output to China\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"324\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59331233-17619245031447096_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>American Soybean Association</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Japan Lowers Their Tariffs</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After ASEAN, President Trump headed to Japan, which had just elected its first female Prime Minister, Takaichi. There, the 25% tariff initially put on Japanese goods has been lowered to 15%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This came in exchange for a pledge of a $550 billion investment in the US. I assume that this will come in the form of foreign direct investment made into Japanese companies' operations in the United States, say Toyota (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TM\" title=\"Toyota Motor Corporation\">TM</a>) or Honda (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HMC\" title=\"Honda Motor Co., Ltd.\">HMC</a>). The timeline for this is currently unclear.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notably here, President Trump told Prime Minister Takaichi that the U.S. is \"<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/world/asia/trump-asia-photos.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/28/world/asia/trump-asia-photos.html\" target=\"_blank\">an ally at the strongest level,</a>\" and to call him if there is \"anything I can do to help Japan.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It remains to be seen what this means in practice, but a lowering of Japanese tariffs was certainly a good start. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4803653-us-japan-trade-deal-mission-accomplished\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4803653-us-japan-trade-deal-mission-accomplished\" target=\"_blank\">Japanese car manufacturers have been eating the tariffs</a> outright since they were announced, likely hoping for an outcome like this that allows them to recover some profit margin without having raised prices on consumers.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_4dc810a9a0667393d37fdfa0b881ec50.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">South Korea Makes a Deal</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seoul also had their <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trumps-korea-trade-deal-revives-concerns-about-currency-flight-2025-10-30/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/trumps-korea-trade-deal-revives-concerns-about-currency-flight-2025-10-30/\" target=\"_blank\">tariffs drop from 25% to 15%</a>, and they agreed to invest $350 billion into the US.

Specifically, the Chinese rare earth restrictions are being discussed, as well as American AI chip restrictions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We get gallium and graphite; they get NVIDIA's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) Blackwell.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The truce lasting for one year is problematic because it's just kicking the can down the road, but it allows for the economy to continue in its current shape while we work towards independence in these areas. Without China, there is no American economy that works the way that it currently does. We just import too many important things, specifically magnets and rare earths.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can't just cut them out and say we don't want the rare earths. We need them to keep economic activity at the level it currently is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is why the other trade deals surrounding the meeting with China were so important. Making a trade truce doesn't solve our problem. We still don't have the gallium and graphite long-term, but in the short term, while we build out those deals with allies, we can keep this supply from China coming in smoothly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Whether you agree with this strategy or not is different from whether it's being implemented. It is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The news saw both American and Chinese markets sell off, but the US rebounded, while Chinese markets continued to erase gains made the past week of the tour following the announcement of the truce.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b87e8bc2a6553634471f527ee662ac4b.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Change in Tone</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What was also interesting surrounding this were the leaders' comments about each other, where they discussed each other as peers and rivals depending on who they were speaking to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It reminds me of when China began to join the WTO and ascended to the world stage in the 1990s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In May 1993,<a href=\"https://china.usc.edu/node/19959\" rel=\"noopener noopener\" title=\"https://china.usc.edu/node/19959\" target=\"_blank\"> President Bill Clinton said</a>: \"We are prepared to build a more cooperative relationship with China and wish to work with China as an active member of the international community.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In July 1993, <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G3oFtynW4AAwnkh?format=jpg&amp;name=large\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G3oFtynW4AAwnkh?format=jpg&amp;name=large\" target=\"_blank\">President Jiang Zemin said</a>: \"For the foreseeable future, the United States will remain our primary adversary...\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To those that were watching closely, it was a clear sign of an asymmetry in our relationship.

For now, we have a truce, while we build independence and work with our allies to create a strategic supply chain that doesn't include a country that considers us its primary adversary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That quote is from 1993, but if you had told me President Xi said it following this meeting, I would believe you. So would most analysts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, there is an impetus for the United States to secure itself strategically. That includes securing strong relationships with our partners and containing our adversaries, both militarily and economically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My view of the situation is still that rare-earth firms continue to benefit despite the trade truce, which saw a sell-off in some rare-earth stocks. The overall macro situation for them remains mostly unchanged; it is overwhelmingly bullish from my view. The US and its allies need to secure these supply chains, regardless of how long they have access to them via China. Relying on China just isn't sustainable long-term, and so the investment into these firms will likely continue at full speed once the government re-opens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Much of the foreign investment promised out of Japan and South Korea will go to strategic supply chains as well, like shipbuilding and domestic manufacturing. This will take time, and it is unclear what the full road of investment looks like. I am eager for more details.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thanks for reading.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FORM\" title=\"FormFactor, Inc.\">FORM</a></span>) reported very positive numbers, which sent its shares over 24% for the day, on the back of improved operational performance and a return to growth in sequential sales. I wanted to take a look at the numbers in more<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> detail and give some comments on the outlook and why I am not particularly itching to start a position.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806987-formfactor-q2-earnings-the-future-looks-much-better-if-everything-goes-well\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4806987-formfactor-q2-earnings-the-future-looks-much-better-if-everything-goes-well\" target=\"_blank\">Since the last time</a> I covered the company, it has done tremendously as its share price doubled in just three months. I said that the future looks very good, but I held off from giving it a buy rating as I had some reservations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>By The Numbers</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Starting from the top, sales topped $202.6m, down 2.6% y/y, but slightly beat analysts’ estimates by $2.6m. DRAM probe cards grew double-digits and were the main contributor to the performance that could have been much worse. The systems segment also experienced growth due to higher initial volume production of co-packaged optics. The company began to see some sequential growth, which is good to see. Looking at the breakdown of sales in a bit more detail, we can see that DRAM sales were clearly the best performer this quarter, while Foundry &amp; Logic saw some softness within the Probe Cards Segment.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2032\" data-height=\"1060\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FORM IR\" width=\"640\" height=\"334\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-1761864979668077_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FORM IR</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of regional breakdown, South Korea seems to be the standout in terms of demand for the company’s products, while China is starting to show some action and is slowly coming back up.

Q3 Non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.33, beating consensus by $0.08. A decent margin. The company’s GAAP margins saw a particularly strong improvement of around 250bps sequentially to almost 40%, while non-GAAP GM came in at 41%. These improvements can be attributed to overall operational efficiencies, cost controls, and labor reductions. The company’s non-GAAP operating margins improved significantly since Q2’25 by around 270bps, leading to the net income increase to $15.66m from $9.09m in Q2, while non-GAAP bottom line came in at $25.68m.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the company’s financial situation, FORM finished the quarter with around $97.6m in cash and equivalents, as well as $168.3m in marketable securities, against $11m in long-term debt. That is essentially no debt, since the company’s liquidity far outweighs the obligations on debt. The company’s balance sheet continues to improve, and I don’t see anything wrong with it. It’s quite strong. The company is flush with cash and will no doubt easily survive any major downturns in the economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of these results, management was kind enough to provide us with some updated numbers for the next quarter. The management now expects to make around $210m in sales, which comes in above the estimates of $199.6m, while adjusted EPS should be around $0.35, which is also well above consensus estimates of $0.29, with gross margin forecasted to reach 42%.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"857\" data-height=\"75\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FORM 8K\" width=\"640\" height=\"56\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48589448-17618649792441597_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FORM 8K</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the results were decent. Sales are beginning to pick up, while the company’s operations have improved significantly in just one quarter. On top of that, the company raised guidance for the rest of the year, coupled with a beat on top and bottom lines, investors sent the company’s shares up over 24% for the day. I think this sort of reaction was a bit too much. Sure, the operational improvements are nice, but top-line growth was still non-existent y/y, but my best guess is that due to a decent sequential improvement, investors believe the company is ready to return to growth. Also, I believe investors are very positive about the company’s DRAM and HBM performance, which are critical for AI. Some analysts raised the company’s price target significantly following the results, due to improved margins, assigning a PT of $44 from $23. A massive bump, which no doubt helped fuel this rally. The PT is still much lower than what the company trades at, but such a boost is telling.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Comments On The Outlook</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management has been doing a tremendous job of getting the company’s efficiency and profitability to where they used to be just one year ago, and I believe those numbers will be improved upon over the next few quarters, especially if the demand for everything AI-related continues the way it has. And I am very certain that this AI hype is not going anywhere for at least another few years. The reason I think so is because the main players in the AI/data center space have all reported their earnings over the last two days, and all of which have not only raised their capex spend from previous estimates for the rest of the year, but also provided not-so-cryptic messaging about the next year’s capex to be significantly higher than 2025’s. So, this means there is going to be a lot of money thrown around still in this AI race, and this only means that companies that have anything to do with AI and data centers will see some sort of a boost for much longer. The stock has already more than doubled since the lows in April, and with the recent results and guidance numbers, investors expect this growth to continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More demand means fixed cost per unit can be spread out more efficiently, leading to higher margins overall, as long as pricing remains stable or decreases. Hype trends like AI are going to continue to drive demand for the company’s products; it’s just a matter of the company actually capturing more of that demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company may not see a lot of growth right now, even if hyperscalers are shoveling billions of dollars into AI. However, due to longer lead times and being somewhat of a specialized semiconductor testing company, I expect growth to come in eventually, which is why, I believe, is the reason we saw such a jump in share price <span>on October 30</span>. Investors are already pricing it in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Closing Comments</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For this reason, I am going to maintain my hold rating, as I believe the growth has been more or less priced in after this massive jump in share price today. I can see the management is doing a great thing regarding improved efficiency and profitability; however, such a jump in price can only mean that the future improvements have been accounted for by investors. Unless the company surprises us even more over the next few quarters, like showing a 50% growth in sales. That would be impressive and would warrant having another look at it in a lot more detail.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, my exposure to everything AI is already too high; therefore, I am going to sit this one out.</p>",

Although revenue disappointed relative to even that pretty low bar, the overall results showed an improving margin on just slightly growing sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The results reported for the third quarter indicate that Verizon is becoming more profitable over time, and indeed, that is the long-term trend as well. In the table below, you can see that since year-end 2021, VZ’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ/income-statement\">gross profit </a>has increased from $77.3 billion to $81.49 billion, while its revenue has increased from $133.6 billion to $137 billion. This indicates that the company’s gross profit margin has increased from 57.8% to 59.4%—a non-negligible increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Verizon gross profit growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"568\" height=\"331\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-1761921560746885.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Verizon gross profit growth <span>(Seeking Alpha Quant)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, we have a considerable increase in Verizon’s gross profit, as well as its gross profit margin, yet VZ stock is actually down 30% over a five-year period.

According to Seeking Alpha Quant, VZ trades at a mere 8.3 times earnings, contributing to an A- valuation rating. This combined with increasing revenue and gross margins would appear to indicate cheapness.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, none of the above means anything if Verizon is destined to have its financial fortunes crumble tomorrow. We always need to attempt to gauge a company’s forward prospects before saying that it is truly cheap. I’ll explore that matter in detail in a later section. For now, I will simply point to the fact that the company has $383 billion in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ/balance-sheet\">assets</a>–only 5.9% of which are goodwill–and $3.6 billion in cash and marketable securities. This is a treasure chest the company can draw on to outlast competitors in times of stress and which can be used to make new investments. These simple facts bode well for Verizon’s future prospects–though obviously we need to look at much more than just balance sheet health before we can fully render a verdict on the matter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another thing investors will want to know about Verizon stock following its third quarter release is its suitability as a dividend stock. Before VZ’s earnings came out, the company had a healthy payout ratio, with Seeking Alpha Quant <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VZ/dividends/scorecard\">confirming it at 57.6%</a> for the trailing 12-month period. With VZ having posted positive earnings growth in the third quarter, that ratio is presumably coming down over time. So, VZ’s 7%-yielding dividend is getting better covered by earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1182\" data-height=\"474\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"VZ dividend summary\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"257\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215609174702_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">VZ dividend summary <span>(Seeking Alpha Quant)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I last covered Verizon stock, I rated it a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4652210-verizon-stands-to-gain-from-falling-inflation\">Buy</a> because of the improvements I saw in its operations. Since then, the company has grown and increased its profitability, while its stock has decreased in price. The underlying value would appear to be greater now. So, I am increasing my rating to Strong Buy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings Recap</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Verizon’s recent <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-reports-3q-2025-earnings-reiterates-full-year-financial-guidance\" rel=\"nofollow\">earnings release</a> mostly exceeded analyst expectations, boasting the following metrics:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>$33.8 billion in revenue, up 1.6% year over year (miss by $400 million).</p></li> <li><p>$1.17 in reported EPS, up 50%.</p></li> <li><p>$1.21 in adjusted EPS, up 1.6% (beat by $0.02).</p></li> <li><p>$28 billion in nine-month operating cash flow, up 5.6%.</p></li> <li><p>$15.8 billion in nine-month free cash flow (FCF), up 8.9%.</p></li> <li><p>$12.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA, up 2.4%.</p></li> <li><p>$21 billion in wireless service revenue, up 2.1%.</p></li> <li><p>$5.6 billion in wireless equipment revenue, up 5.2%.</p></li> <li><p>261,000 wireless net additions.</p></li> <li><p>306,000 broadband net additions.</p></li> <li><p>Guidance for 1% to 3% EPS growth.</p></li> <li><p>Guidance for $19.5 billion to $20.5 billion in full-year FCF.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the headline metrics were all pretty satisfactory. Additionally, there were some nice tidbits of information away in the release as well, for example:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>There were 61,000 internet net additions in the quarter, the best result seen in two years.</p></li> <li><p>Postpaid average revenue per account (ARPA) improved 2%.</p></li> <li><p>The company had 13.2 million total broadband customers by the end of the quarter.</p></li> <li><p>It also delivered a $6.7 billion reduction in net debt.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These additional facts go to show that Verizon is not only beating earnings expectations but also improving its financial condition as well as customer totals. It looks like a pretty good picture.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Future Prospects</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having looked at VZ’s most recent periodic performance, we can now attempt to gauge its future prospects. I already touched on this in the introduction, when I wrote that the company has a lot of assets and cash with which to invest. That is one competitive edge that could drive future growth for VZ. Another, less measurable (but still important) edge the company has is a strong focus on <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/verizon-boosts-annual-forecast-demand-premium-plans-tax-law-benefit-2025-07-21/\" rel=\"nofollow\">premium plans</a>. While telcos in general don’t enjoy much <a href=\"https://www.iotinsider.com/iot-insights/technical-insights/the-true-cost-of-falling-telecoms-prices/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pricing power</a>, with service prices declining long-term, there are segments of the telco market where suppliers have more power. One of those is the “ultra high speed” segment, where unlimited 5G plans can often come at a significant cost to consumers. Customers are often willing to pay up for such plans. This is particularly the case with customers who <em>need</em> constant high-speed internet, such as gamers and business owners. Verizon is investing heavily in servicing such consumers, buying up fibre optic companies to help serve them.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next up, we can look at the multiples that Verizon trades at. At today’s price, VZ is a pretty cheap-looking stock, trading at 8.3 times earnings, 1.2 times sales, and 1.56 times book. You can see more multiples in the image below, courtesy of Seeking Alpha Quant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1048\" data-height=\"1240\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"VZ valuation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"757\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/52770058-17619215613569076_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">VZ valuation <span>(Seeking Alpha Quant)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One multiple that looks very intriguing here is the PEG ratio, which indicates truly extreme cheapness after factoring in growth. I don’t think that VZ’s earnings growth rate is going to remain at 103% forever–the company doesn’t have the top-line growth to support that–but it should be positive. So, I expect VZ to continue having a respectable PEG ratio, unless its price rises dramatically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for what VZ is worth in terms of discounted cash flows:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I found from Capital IQ data that analysts estimate VZ’s cost of equity at 7% and its long-term earnings growth rate at 1.3%. Using these estimates as well as Seeking Alpha Quant’s estimate of VZ’s FCF per share, I got a $85.79 fair value estimate.

These include:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p><strong>Competition.</strong> There are many telcos in the United States, and some, such as AT&amp;T Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T\" title=\"AT&amp;T Inc.\">T</a>) are quite strong and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T/balance-sheet\">well funded</a>. They could bring competition to Verizon that puts pressure on its margins.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Little pricing power.</strong> Verizon does not appear to have much pricing power, as evidenced by the fact that it <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/verizon-posts-higher-subscriber-loss-price-hikes-competition-2025-04-22/\" rel=\"nofollow\">experienced subscriber loss</a> when it attempted to hike prices earlier this year.</p></li> <li><p><strong>High costs.</strong> Telco services are capital-intensive owing to the fact that they run on large amounts of heavy infrastructure. This typically requires them to borrow lots of money, although Verizon has been paying down its debt in recent quarters.</p></li> </ol> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The above risks are worth keeping in mind. However, Verizon’s cheapness more than adequately compensates for them, making the company's stock a buy in my books.</p>",

But there are other factors to consider as well. As an example, I usually give additional wiggle room to high-quality companies with industry-leading positions. And if those businesses are growing at a nice pace, I give even more wiggle room. A great example of this that, recently, has fallen a bit short, is none other than the appropriately named Waste Management (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WM\" title=\"Waste Management, Inc.\">WM</a>). Since <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4763847-waste-management-still-offers-upside-as-cash-flows-are-slated-to-grow-rapidly\">I reaffirmed the company</a> as a ‘buy’ candidate in early March of this year, the S&amp;P 500 has shot up 13%. But over that same time, shares of the company have dropped 6.6%. This is disheartening to say the least. But honestly, all this does, in my view, is open up a door for additional purchases for those who are inclined to do so.</p> <p>The fact of the matter is that Waste Management has achieved strong growth recently. And in all likelihood, that growth will continue for the foreseeable future. In fact, for the upcoming earnings release covering the third quarter of the 2025 fiscal year, which management is supposed to announce on October 28th before the market opens, revenue and profits are both expected to rise. It is true that shares are not as cheap as I would like them to be. But compared to other major players in the market, the stock is certainly affordable. So unless some major negative event comes out of the woodwork, I will almost certainly maintain my ‘buy’ rating on the stock.</p> <p><em>Read more <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833456-waste-management-downturn-doesnt-justify-sitting-in-waste-bin\">here</a>...</em></p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w640\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-loaded=\"true\" width=\"550\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\" height=\"20\"></p> </blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4832961-pagaya-technologies-the-ai-credit-platform-turning-data-into-durable-profits\">Pagaya Technologies: The AI Credit Platform Turning Data Into Durable Profits</a></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/pau-galindo-ortigosa\">Pau Galindo Ortigosa</a> | <em>Strong Buy</em></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>Pagaya Technologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PGY\" title=\"Pagaya Technologies Ltd.\">PGY</a>) stock reached a new high of $44.99 on September 19, 2025.

The Canadian Natural Resources Limited (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNQ\" title=\"Canadian Natural Resources Limited\">CNQ</a>) is the largest producer of Canadian oil, with high financial stability and potential for further scaling of export activities. With CNQ's per-barrel production costs significantly lower than those of its main industry competitors in North America, it has the guarantee of maintaining positive financial results during a downturn in the oil market.</p> <p>Moreover, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/bessent-u-s-to-impose-substantial-sanctions-on-russia-84132054?mod=Searchresults&amp;pos=2&amp;page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">new sanctions</a> against Russia's oil industry could potentially halt Russian oil supplies to China and India. If the capacity of the Trans Mountain pipeline is fully utilized, Canadian Natural Resources could increase its oil supplies by concluding new agreements with Chinese oil refineries. Moreover, for oil prices, the new sanctions against Russian oil companies are an additional factor that, if not raising the cost of hydrocarbons, then at least halting its decline in the short and medium term.</p> <p>Considering CNQ's positive outlook and competitive advantages, I recommend these shares as a \"Buy.\" In this article, I will reveal more detailed information about the reasons behind my decision. That said, I am not an active supporter of the bullish camp when it comes to oil companies. For instance, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830223-civitas-resources-potential-merger-with-sm-energy-may-lead-to-a-stock-decline\">my latest fundamental analysis</a> of the oil company Civitas Resources (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIVI\" title=\"Civitas Resources, Inc.\">CIVI</a>) resulted in a \"Sell\" recommendation.

One of the stocks riding this AI bandwagon has been Power Solutions International, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSIX\" title=\"Power Solutions International, Inc.\">PSIX</a>), which has surged 20-fold in a matter of ~two years. The meteoric rise of PSIX has been driven by its timely pivot toward catering to AI data center-related demand as opposed to its legacy business catering to the industrial and transportation sector.</p> <p>I believe the demand related to data centers continues to be robust, with hyperscalers and other cloud providers either setting up or pledging to set up multi-gigawatt-scale data centers. While PSIX should benefit from this tailwind, I believe its unique position as a lesser-established player in the industry makes it vulnerable as the competitive industry brews up and customers switch back to more established players. Furthermore, a significant stake sale by an insider further makes me cautious about PSIX's prospects.</p> <p>While my outlook is quite cautious on the stock, I am refraining from issuing a sell rating, particularly due to good fundamental momentum in the data center space. I would like to wait for a confirmation sign that competitive intensity is growing and materially affecting PSIX’s numbers, particularly margins. Until then, I would be sitting on the sidelines with a hold (neutral) rating on the stock.</p> <p><em>Read more <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834744-the-ai-hype-could-end-early-for-power-solutions-international\">here</a>...</em></p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w640\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-loaded=\"true\" width=\"550\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\" height=\"20\"></p> </blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833118-nuscale-danger-signs-on-meltdown-of-speculative-froth\">NuScale: Danger Signs On Meltdown Of Speculative Froth</a></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/jr-research\">JR Research</a> | <em>Hold</em></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>I've never been that interested in investing in energy companies, let alone companies that specialize in nuclear energy technology like NuScale Power Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMR\" title=\"NuScale Power Corporation\">SMR</a>). However, 2025 has been a real eye-opener even to a seasoned investor and market watcher that I consider myself to be, as the stock of money-losing companies has continued its rampaging run. That said, I'm not particularly perturbed about missing \"big speculative opportunities\" if they aren't backed by solid fundamentals.</p> <p>Also, I'm not especially keen on scooping up so-called \"undervalued\" plays in the fundamentally/structurally challenged sectors of the market (like the oil and gas peers, some healthcare plays, etc.). Investors who position the majority of their portfolios in these sectors have arguably missed out on partaking in the advance impelled by the tech and Mag 7 stocks as they demonstrate their AI prowess while also continuing to build their clout in this fourth industrial AI revolution.</p> <p>I brought up the issue of speculative opportunities earlier because I believe SMR stock falls right into such a setup. It's not a coincidence that SMR is also the acronym for \"small modular reactor\" as much as it refers specifically to the ticker symbol for <a href=\"https://www.nuscalepower.com/hubfs/Website/Investors/Investor-Presentation.pdf?hsLang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">NuScale Power</a>. What's critical for investors to note is that the company has consistently positioned itself as a key technology enabler or provider, encompassing its burgeoning partnership with ENTRA1, while also relying on Doosan as its key manufacturing partner. The reportedly asset-light approach is designed to help <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4810761-nuscale-power-corporation-smr-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">NuScale potentially avoid the CapEx</a> complexities and financing challenges entailed with being a developer while also benefiting from the manufacturing expertise of a trusted supply chain partner.</p> <p>Yet, the drawback suggests that it's imperative for NuScale to manage the supply chain dynamics extremely well in this early stage of the SMR buildout, even though it has obtained NRC approval. In addition, I believe we must also be cognizant of the challenges that encompass the multi-year rollout of NuScale's ability to scale, given the investments it has made in long-lead materials this year to pave the runway for a 2030 commercial operation date status, which is pivotal to justifying the extremely frothy valuation metrics that complement its investment thesis right now.</p> <p><em>Read more <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833118-nuscale-danger-signs-on-meltdown-of-speculative-froth\">here</a>...</em></p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w640\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-loaded=\"true\" width=\"550\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\" height=\"20\"></p> </blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835217-droneshield-stock-potential-for-exponential-revenue-growth\">DroneShield: Potential For Exponential Revenue Growth</a></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/stephen-tobin\">Stephen Tobin</a> | <em>Strong Buy</em></p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>DroneShield (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DRSHF#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\" title=\"DroneShield Limited\">OTCPK:DRSHF</a>) is an Australian company that manufactures counter-drone systems.

They say it's wise to take a safe position while the music’s still playing and the lights are on. And even if the party lasts longer than expected, it's always smart to have some, maybe not the front-line growers, but great value stocks in your portfolio.</p> <p>In my opinion, one area worth exploring for relatively safe plays is the category of so-called “fallen angels” — solid leaders with well-established businesses that are currently facing turbulence. However, if the issues seem to be rather temporary ones, the business model isn’t broken, the financials remain within a credible range, and competitive management is in place, then these companies could be well-positioned for recovery.</p> <p>Easy to say, hard to find — at least in my experience. Still, I carved out some dedicated time and started digging and ended up with two companies I think are worth a closer look. One of them, which I started reviewing last week, had an earnings release just around the corner, offers an 11% dividend, runs a somewhat old-fashioned and sluggish — but definitely not broken — business, has strong financials, and has a solid story that suggests stability, maybe even some growth ahead. If there’s interest, one could <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833210-western-union-stock-value-opportunity-with-a-secure-dividend\">check it out here.</a></p> <p>The other one that fell within my criteria was United Parcel Service, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPS\" title=\"United Parcel Service, Inc.\">UPS</a>). That’s where I’m reminded of an old Warren Buffett saying: it’s better to invest in a business you understand. It wasn’t exactly phrased like that word-for-word, but the broader meaning holds true to me. And I think, broadly and simply put, delivering packages around the world and right to the doorstep is a business most people can grasp more easily than, say, quantum computing. A 7.5% dividend yield is very attractive, and a forward-looking P/E of 13.5 made me want to dig deeper to see if I’m not missing a great opportunity here.</p> <p>Having done the analysis, I rate UPS as a Buy. In my view, the current struggles are fixable, and the likelihood of a successful turnaround is relatively high. Even if finding firmer footing takes time, the dividend looks sustainable for now — unless something truly extraordinary happens.</p> <p><em>Read more <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834081-ups-back-on-track-cash-flow-supports-dividend\">here</a>...</em></p> <p><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w640\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" data-loaded=\"true\" width=\"550\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2024/1/2/saupload_71db859018690ef66012fbeb07234d30.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\" height=\"20\"></p> </blockquote> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Now, the leader in terms of AUM on the market is the <span class=\"cf0\">Alerian</span><span class=\"cf0 paywall-full-content\"> MLP ETF</span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> (AMLP), and in some ways, I understand the enthusiasm.

Yet its investment strategy is very simple: it’s a passive ETF with the Alerian MLP Index (float-adjusted, cap-weighted) as its benchmark and an expense ratio of 0.85%. So the core remains U.S. energy MLPs (oil &amp; gas pipelines), with a specific focus on the <a href=\"https://www.alpsfunds.com/hubfs/alps-docs/lit/fs/alerian-mlp-etf-amlp-fs.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">midstream energy</a> segment (transport &amp; storage).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"780\" data-height=\"258\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMLP: profile\" width=\"640\" height=\"212\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619011375105422_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AMLP: profile <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">1) Holding distribution: high concentration.</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A first element to discuss is certainly the holding distribution.

And I had already stated that MLPX would in my opinion be a more competitive pick in this segment (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797987-among-mlps-mlpx-is-the-most-promising-candidate-going-forward\">read here</a>). What I personally appreciate, and I recognize it may be debatable, is the presence of a structural mix that goes beyond AMLP’s concentration. In MLPX, for example, there are holdings both of midstream MLPs and energy infrastructure corporations, which is why the holding distribution broadens and total performance increases. An element that, in my opinion, is further amplified in ENFR.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"803\" data-height=\"193\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMLP - MLPA - MLPX - ENFR: Concentration &amp; Risk\" width=\"640\" height=\"154\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-17619015205813193_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AMLP - MLPA - MLPX - ENFR: Concentration &amp; Risk <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why is it so attractive?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ll get straight to the point, the reason why this sector is chosen, despite a capital loss of about 37% since 2010, is in my opinion the high yield element, which today is very competitive, equal to 8.3% distributed quarterly;</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"780\" data-height=\"335\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMLP: Dividend Grade\" width=\"640\" height=\"275\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-1761901695670845_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AMLP: Dividend Grade <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And it’s, in my opinion, an expression of <a href=\"https://www.alpsfunds.com/hubfs/alps-docs/lit/insight/alerian-mlp-etf-amlp-insights-20250930.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">the genuineness</a> of the MLP segment in general (not just AMLP): not by chance there’s a good coverage ratio of the distribution, between 45% – 70%.

So, these considerations should not be considered exhaustive: they only reflect my personal reflection and experience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But a good chapter could be opened in this sense. This is because <a href=\"https://www.alpsfunds.com/viewer?&amp;id=53158024758\" rel=\"nofollow\">AMLP is not a RIC</a>, therefore it has deferred tax liabilities theoretically positive. In this sense, the benefit of the MLPs is lost and in my personal opinion this is the reason why there is an evident divergence in performance compared to the reference index. Discussing it with other bank advisor colleagues, it seems that often the “tax simplicity” is preferred to the “convenience,” and on this I have no doubts. For this reason it is a very subjective reasoning, and I only bring you my opinion. But I repeat: personally, this leads me even more to prefer MLP stock picking.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NB: moving to the side of share distribution; it is always over 70% ROC, an element that as you know instead is associated with tax benefits (reduces the tax basis of the shares).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">4) Catalysts? Which ones?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Behind the rebound of the segment there are certainly many interesting narratives. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797987-among-mlps-mlpx-is-the-most-promising-candidate-going-forward\">In my opinion</a>, the prevailing one is the boom in demand coming from AI/data centers build-out. Contextualizing more based on the recent news of these weeks, there seem to be 2 other potential positive catalysts: the new U.S. sanctions against Russia but also the Fed rate cuts. This generates primarily positive pressure on the price of oil, and secondly, a potential boost for the commodities segment (because industrial expectations increase). If we add to this the pullback of about 10% since April 2025, it seems like a real opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, some clarifications are needed.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The risk of AMLP, shared also by its peers and by individual MLPs, is that they are linked to oil production. But attention, here a not insignificant disconnection is created in my opinion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When expectations related to oil production decline, MLPs price in a potential negative cycle in their fundamentals. But this does not make AMLP an “oil price beta” ETF. And we can see the divergence in the positive tail of the return distribution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"704\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMLP - OILK: price return\" width=\"640\" height=\"282\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58581242-176190228098173_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AMLP - OILK: price return <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At a fundamental level what happens?

This is why since 2022 this sector has held up well through the economic cyclical rotation. Secondly, the intentions confirmed by OPEC to increase production, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/opec-leaning-towards-another-small-oil-output-increase-sources-say-2025-10-27/\" rel=\"nofollow\">not reduce it</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the MLP segment can truly help diversify the portfolio’s income sources and provide good capital preservation. On AMLP, although it is a leader in the sector, I find some weaknesses I couldn’t overlook. Considering the strong concentration, the tax burden, the presence of more competitive peers, and ultimately the lack of a clear short-term catalyst, I think the right rating for AMLP is Hold.</p>",

(NYSE:<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VALE\" class=\"ticker-link\">VALE</a>) is a producer and miner of minerals for various commercial production purposes, primarily iron ore, but also nickel and copper, due to the structure of its mines and deposits in its portfolio. Its business is<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> primarily focused on Latin America, especially Brazil, but it also owns and manages deposits in North America and Asia. Iron ore is undoubtedly Vale's main product. It represents a total of 84 million tons of production, compared to 40,000 tons of nickel and 93,000 tons of copper.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the past year, the company has experienced a decline in revenue due to a fall in the international price of iron ore. This decline began rapidly in 2022 but has continued since January 2024, where it had last recovered. This trend is closely linked to the slowdown in Chinese economic growth. It is important to understand this concept because the Asian giant currently accounts for more than 50% of global steel production, the main raw material of which is iron ore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1915\" data-height=\"953\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ironore\" width=\"640\" height=\"318\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616686239941401_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Trading Economics</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, as I will try to describe in this report, especially in the following thesis segment, the characteristics of VALE as a company and the potential it has in the short and medium term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As previously mentioned, VALE maintains a stake in Latin America, North America, and Asia.

In this sense, the Asian giant represents one of the main demanders of this commodity, based on the fact that the country is the world's leading steel producer. Therefore, understanding China's performance in the short term is key to the future of the international price of iron ore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, the question arises as to what could happen in the medium and long term. In this sense, it is necessary to understand the growth in demand that other countries and regions may experience. As can be seen below, VALE expects that, on the iron ore demand side, China will continue to show a downward trend in the medium term. However, the trend is expected to increase, driven by greater participation from India and other countries outside the main demanders at this time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603851214233418.png?io=w640\" alt=\"demanda\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"433\" height=\"452\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603851214233418.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603851214233418.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603851214233418.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603851214233418.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603851214233418.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603851214233418.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603851214233418.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603851214233418.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Vale 2Q2025 results presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding these forecasts, from my perspective, it's important to note that the expectation for India's growth is well-founded. According to some specialized websites, <a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/indl-goods/svs/steel/steel-demand-in-india-set-to-grow-9-in-2025-2026/articleshow/124532216.cms?from=mdr\" rel=\"nofollow\">steel production in India is expected to grow by approximately 9%</a> in the short term. Regarding the company's forecasts for China and its demand for iron ore, they appear to be rather conservative. <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/chinas-ravenous-appetite-iron-ore-remains-steel-output-slips-2025-10-28/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Much of the market expects demand for this mineral</a> from the Asian giant to remain strong, which could offer a better short-term outlook than the company anticipates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving on to the iron ore supply, as long as international prices remain stable, VALE expects a significant portion of iron ore mines to return to profitability, leading to a recovery in production from there. However, they estimate that even then, they will not be able to cope with even more significant demand growth by 2030. These highlights price pressure that could be beneficial for the industry. This could not only lead to a recovery in the company's margins, but also, given the increase in production that VALE is expected to drive, a significant increase in revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603852297803528.png?io=w640\" alt=\"oferta\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"517\" height=\"341\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603852297803528.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603852297803528.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603852297803528.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603852297803528.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603852297803528.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603852297803528.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603852297803528.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603852297803528.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Vale 2Q2025 results presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this regard, the year 2025 represented a significant increase compared to 2024 in terms of copper and nickel tonnage. While it's true that the increase in iron ore was a smaller percentage, it grew by around 3.7% compared to 2024. Considering the volumes this metal represents in VALE's total production, we see that, from my perspective, an increase of this magnitude is interesting and attractive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"912\" data-height=\"376\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"producción de VALE\" width=\"640\" height=\"264\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603841640374057_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Vale 2Q2025 results presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead and toward margin recovery, it's interesting to see the company's achievements in reducing or controlling costs.

First, I want to focus on production changes, and then move on to the financial results. In this regard, Vale's total iron ore production during the second quarter of 2025 was 77.35 million metric tons. This figure, compared to the 79.79 million metric tons produced in the second quarter of 2024, represents a decrease of approximately 3%. Furthermore, compared to the first quarter of 2024, production grew 17% compared to the 66.14 million metric tons produced in the first quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding the international price of iron ore, the downward trend mentioned in the thesis segment can be seen. As can be seen, Vale's realized price of the commodity in 2Q2025 was $97.8/ton, while in 1Q2025 it was $103.6/ton, representing a drop of approximately 6%. Compared to 2Q2024, the drop was approximately 13% compared to the $111.8/ton reported by the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would now like to analyze the main financial results reported by VALE. Regarding revenues, the company reported a result of $8.8 billion in the second quarter of 2025. This represented an 11% decrease compared to the $9.9 billion for the same period in 2024. However, when we analyze it compared to the first quarter of 2025 figures, we see an 8% increase compared to the $8.12 billion for that period. This continues to reflect the trend described at the beginning of this section.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1103\" data-height=\"539\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"resultados\" width=\"640\" height=\"313\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603887912051623_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Vale 2Q2025 Earnings Release</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's now analyze the company's reported EBITDA figures. VALE reported a total of $3,386 million in 2Q2025. Again, compared to the figures reported in 2Q2024, we see a 15% drop compared to the $3,993 million reported in that period. Again, compared to 1Q2025, we see an increase of approximately 9% compared to the $3,115 million reported in that quarter. It's interesting to analyze the EV/EBITDA ratio. Annualizing the previously described figures, we can calculate a ratio of approximately 4.99x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"904\" data-height=\"359\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EBITDA\" width=\"640\" height=\"254\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603844040233567_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Vale 2Q2025 Results Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another interesting point was the quarter-over-quarter decline in CapEx and compared to last year. In Q2 2025, the company's reported CapEx was $1,053 million, a 10% decrease compared to the $1,173 million reported in Q1 2025. The decline is even greater compared to Q2 2024.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Valuation</span></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For this segment, I developed a DCF model, in order to further contribute to the description of the company and the scenario in which it operates, in light of what can be expected. In this regard, I first describe the assumptions I used to perform the calculations. Regarding the tax rate, I used 18%. While it may seem low compared to other industries, when examining the effective rate in Seeking Alpha's Financials segment, according to the data reported by the company, it can be seen that the average for recent years is below that value. I deliberately decided to perform the calculations with a higher rate to generate a margin of safety in the company's valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding the perpetual growth rate, I decided to use a value of 2%, which is slightly below global GDP growth in recent decades, a value to which the demand for steel, and therefore for iron ore, is closely linked. Again, the idea behind this selection was to maintain a margin of safety in relation to the company's final valuation. Regarding the WACC, I would like to explain in a little more detail why I believe a value of 10% contributes more to that margin of safety. First, when analyzing the capital structure, we can see that Vale has a market capitalization of $45.67 billion and a debt stock of $20.39 billion. This generates a debt and equity-to-total assets ratio of 30.9% and 69.1%, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding the cost of debt, <a href=\"https://es.tradingview.com/symbols/BMFBOVESPA-VALE3/bonds/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the volume-weighted average of bonds</a> issued gives the company a yield of around 5.34%. In this sense, a WACC of 10% would imply a cost of equity of 12.08%, which, considering the company's <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VALE/\" rel=\"nofollow\">beta of approximately 1.02</a>, seems reasonable, even considering that the company's primary business is in emerging countries. In fact, when we look at specialized sites, we can see that the WACC they assign to the company is <a href=\"https://www.gurufocus.com/term/wacc/VALE\" rel=\"nofollow\">around 6.5%,</a> considerably lower than the one I decided to choose. This is undoubtedly where I tried to be more conservative, charging a penalty precisely because of the risks inherent in the countries in which Vale operates, but also as confirmation of the generation of the safety margin I've been mentioning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding EBITDA growth, I proposed a 5% increase for the first year, 4.5% for the second, 4% for the third, 3% for the fourth, and 2.5% for the fifth, aligning with the same growth rate in perpetuity thereafter. While this may seem like a high-growth rate, as can be seen in the table below, market analysts' forecasts indicate an EPS of $1.81, while the value for 2024 was $1.42. Considering this increase, it can be seen that a 5% increase in EBITDA is quite conservative. Regarding amortization and depreciation, to simplify the calculations, I assumed they would grow at a rate equal to that of EBITDA. Finally, regarding CapEx, I estimated a constant growth of 1.5% throughout the period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1220\" data-height=\"160\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EPS\" width=\"640\" height=\"84\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/13/59379552-17603835094117706_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha Earnings Segment</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, taking all these assumptions into consideration, it can be seen that the company has attractive upside potential. It's important to note that this value is obtained even under the conservative assumptions that sought to generate a margin of safety. From my perspective, these results reinforce the scenario and forecasts detailed in the thesis segment and provide further justification for the BUY rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"694\" data-height=\"530\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DCF2\" width=\"640\" height=\"489\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/59379552-17616691823185523_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha Financials &amp; my own estimates</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks And Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I would like to mention the main risks that may be looming in the short term. Without a doubt, the most important to note, from my perspective, is the change in foreign trade policy undertaken by the United States government. The White House's initiative to increase import tariffs on the vast majority of countries has China as one of the main targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the impact this Asian country represents on steel production and iron ore demand, the escalation of the situation could be a major risk. While it is true that other players are expected to drive demand in the medium term, the fact that Chinese economic growth does not recover or, worse still, declines as a result of a trade war with the United States, could affect the transition period and generate a further downward trend in iron ore prices in the short term.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, due to the geographic location of VALE's business, I believe the Brazilian company is better positioned than some other competitors to address the risks. Given the scenario I sought and the company's valuation, I believe VALE has good growth prospects and can benefit greatly from a change in the cycle. At the same time, it has the qualities to withstand a continuation of the trend experienced by iron ore in recent years. Therefore, I consider the company a BUY.</p>",

Any transshipment from third countries faces a 40% duty. Still, Vietnam will improve market access by resolving constraints that U.S. exports face.

The U.S. and China paused tariffs and restrictions, respectively, for one year. They will continue to play their long game using short-term agreements in principle. Investors will need to exercise caution in holding companies that struggled before tariffs. For example, Newell Brands Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NWL\" title=\"Newell Brands Inc.\">NWL</a>) lost 32% despite indicating the impact of tariffs <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4512350-newell-brands-outlines-2026-innovation-push-and-expects-operating-cash-flow-to-strengthen\">subsiding in 2026</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China is not faring well economically. Weaker exports, hurt by U.S. tariffs, resulted in factory activity falling to a six-month low.

Investors would not likely notice the weak data. FXI stock is up by 25% in the last year. The country’s technology stocks are up, too. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA\" title=\"Alibaba Group Holding Limited\">BABA</a>) gained 98.8% and Tencent Holdings Limited (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCEHY\" title=\"Tencent Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:TCEHY</a>) is up by 51.8% YTD. Technology investors need not worry about the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510996-trump-says-no-discussion-with-xi-on-nvidia-blackwell-chip-sales-to-china\">absence of discussing</a> NVIDIA Corporation's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) Blackwell chip sales to China.

This is one of a few market-leading companies with a significant presence, highlighting more than <a href=\"https://corporate.lowes.com/who-we-are/our-business\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">1,700</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> stores.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">LOW stock has declined by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW\">9%</a> over the past 12 months, mainly driven by weak US consumer demand due to an elevated interest-rate environment and slower demand for home improvements. I think a meaningful decrease in new home sales trends, experienced since about 2021, has also significantly contributed to its bearish performance. Although the chart below highlights that <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/new-home-sales\" rel=\"nofollow\">new home sales may resume</a>, it may take time for this to translate into significant top and bottom-line growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"879\" data-height=\"555\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"LOW: United States New Home Sales\" width=\"640\" height=\"404\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/59261277-17617300101956096_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">LOW: United States New Home Sales <span>(Tradingeconomics.com)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is why I think that Lowe's Companies is a Hold with a $266 price target over the next 12 months. This suggests roughly market-like returns, highlighting a 9% upside possibility without dividends. I believe the stock price may mirror bottom-line growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, unless consumers significantly recover and real estate activity increases, I am not sure whether the company can substantially outperform the benchmark in the following year. It has several tailwinds tied to a dovish Fed and easing cycle, but policy might take time; therefore, I remain cautious and monitor the macroeconomic outlook.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FQ2 2026 Snapshot: Double-Beat Performance, Guiding For A Positive Shift</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On August 20, the company delivered<a href=\"https://corporate.lowes.com/sites/lowes-corp/files/lowes-q2-2025-press-release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"> FQ2 2026</a> results. This was a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/earnings\">double-beat</a> quarter, implying a shift in resumed top-line growth and bottom-line increase. However, based on the neutral investors' reaction, it seems that the market had already anticipated a turnaround, as the stock remained flat with roughly a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/historical-price-quotes\">0.60%</a> drop over the following trading day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lowe's posted $23.96 billion in revenue, up by 1.58% on a year-over-year basis, breaking the streak of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/earnings\">9 consecutive top-line decline</a> quarters. This arrived at about $9 million above what the market had anticipated. The bottom line came in at $4.33 in diluted EPS, indicating approximately 6% increase versus $4.10 in the same quarter last year, and $0.09 above the analysts' estimates, implying a 2% surprise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1053\" data-height=\"461\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"LOW: FQ2 2025 Key Highlights\" width=\"640\" height=\"280\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618140109823966_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">LOW: FQ2 2025 Key Highlights <span>(Lowe's Companies Investor Relations)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management highlighted that the comparable sales increased by 1.1%, which is uplifting, considering the company has been experiencing a multi-month top-line contraction. The retail company underscored that it achieved 33.8% gross margin and 14.5% operating margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The home renovation business represented a 3.6% increase in comparable sales for ticket sizes exceeding $500, which I believe is promising and supports a bullish future. This also correlates to an increase in new home sales in the US, implying that home renovation products are typically tied to a higher price tag. Moreover, it may indicate that consumer spending is improving, and that would be a positive tailwind for this retail industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1050\" data-height=\"342\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"LOW: FQ2 2025 Key Highlights\" width=\"640\" height=\"208\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618143136829653_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">LOW: FQ2 2025 Key Highlights <span>(Lowe's Companies Investor Relations)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the upside, the company highlighted it has experienced positive comparable sales in 9 out of 15 regions it operates. This also supports a bullish narrative and may sustain a positive stock price momentum, underlining a roughly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/historical-price-quotes\">7% increase</a> over the past 6 months. I think this quarterly report underscored a promising shift in the company's performance. If the trend continues, I believe Lowe may rebound from these levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lowe's is expected to deliver its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly\">FQ3 2026</a> results on November 19, before the market opens. The market is forecasting $20.88 billion in revenue, implying about a 3.5% growth on a year-over-year basis, and roughly $3.00 in diluted EPS, representing approximately a 3.7% increase over the past 12 months. I think the company appears to be well-positioned to achieve these results. Given its recent performance and uptick in new home sales, LOW may meet the market expectations. If that materializes, investor confidence may improve, followed by expectations of a recovering consumer.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lowe's Appears To Be Fairly Priced, And I Argue That The Market Has Priced In The Consumer Recovery</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The home renovation retailer currently trades at a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/valuation/metrics\">forward P/E of about 20</a>, which appears to be approximately 12% overvalued versus the sector median of around 18 earnings multiples. However, versus the average company in the S&amp;P500 at roughly<a href=\"https://en.macromicro.me/series/20052/sp500-forward-pe-ratio\" rel=\"nofollow\"> 24x</a>, Lowe's trades at a 20% discount. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618154444049218.png?io=w640\" alt=\"LOW: Forward P/E\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"622\" height=\"409\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618154444049218.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618154444049218.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618154444049218.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618154444049218.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618154444049218.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618154444049218.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618154444049218.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618154444049218.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">LOW: Forward P/E <span>(YCharts)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The chart above also suggests that the current valuation reflects the high end of the trading range, which supports my outlook that upside may be limited in the near term. The forward P/E has increased significantly from about the mid-14's back in December 2023 to the current levels, mainly driven by the bottoming phase in the real estate market, as that period reflected the weakest activity over the past years. This also may support my stance that consumer recovery may already be priced in. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the forward PEG (non-GAAP) basis of 3.16, the company appears to be trading at a substantial premium to peers at 1.73. This implies more than an 80% premium, which adds an extra argument to my bearish stance. This also clouds a positive outlook. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The forward EV/Sales and Price/Sales ratios of 2.01 and 1.61, respectively, justify my thesis supporting a slightly bearish outlook, and that the market may have already priced in the improvement of consumer spending. This presents 60% overvaluation at the midpoint versus the sector median of 1.35 and 0.97. This also shows that even though the home renovation company may post an acceleration in top-line growth, this does not necessarily result in stock price appreciation. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"871\" data-height=\"214\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"LOW: Capital Structure\" width=\"640\" height=\"157\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618160646215525_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">LOW: Capital Structure <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lowe's remains a heavily leveraged company, and that may cap the upside in the near term. The retail name has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/valuation/capital-structure\">$39 billion</a> in total obligations, which appears to be significant, and resulted in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/income-statement\">$355 million</a> in interest expenses to service the debt. Although it has $5.26 billion in cash that partially offsets its obligations, it remains elevated and could weigh on the stock price further.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company had achieved a roughly flat performance on both top and bottom lines over the past year. LOW experienced a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/growth\">0.49%</a> revenue decline and 0.93% EPS growth over the past 12 months. This may suggest that the current valuation appears slightly too high. However, I think investors have priced in the consumer recovery, which resulted in a premium multiple. Nevertheless, this suggests that if the company experiences weaker-than-anticipated results, the stock price could correct from these levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The retail company has been operating at a roughly market-like gross profit margin (TTM) of about <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/profitability\">34%</a>, which justifies a fair valuation. This implies about a 13% discount to peers in the consumer discretionary segment, but I think that with consumer recovery, the company may be able to enhance profitability metrics. However, this is an area to monitor for investors, as higher margins could result in premium multiples.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618165161298163.png?io=w640\" alt=\"LOW: Net Income (TTM)\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"624\" height=\"413\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618165161298163.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618165161298163.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618165161298163.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618165161298163.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618165161298163.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618165161298163.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618165161298163.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59261277-17618165161298163.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">LOW: Net Income (TTM) <span>(YCharts)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, the net income margin (TTM) of 8.20% reflects about 2x outperformance versus peers of 4.31%, and that supports a bullish narrative for the company. This also highlights that LOW remains a highly profitable business, which may fuel the bottom-line growth in the following years. This also supports my thesis that the stock price may follow EPS expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wall Street <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/earnings/estimates\">estimates</a> a $12.32 in diluted EPS for fiscal FY2026, up by 3% on a year-over-year basis, and $13.32 for fiscal FY2027, reflecting 8% increase versus the fiscal FY2026 estimate. I think Lowe's appears to be well-positioned to achieve these results. The company remains profitable, operating at market-like margins. If real estate activity continues to improve, and consumer spending rises, this may act as a substantial tailwind driving the bottom-line growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we apply a roughly current earnings multiple of 20x to a fiscal FY2027 EPS estimate of $13.32, we arrive at my price target of $266. This would represent about 9% upside possibility, driven by bottom-line growth. However, given the macroeconomic uncertainties, I think the stock may mirror its EPS performance, yet I am not sure whether LOW can significantly outperform the benchmark without a significant revenue growth catalyst.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Main Risks And Concerns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are risks and concerns tied to Lowe's that could meaningfully impact the stock price performance in the short term. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The home renovation company is highly dependent on the macroeconomic outlook. If inflation remains elevated or the job market weakens, this could result in slower-than-anticipated consumer spending and suppressed sentiment. This may also encourage the Fed to pause the easing cycle, which would establish an unfavorable environment for the company. This could stress its performance and result in continued underperformance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although new home sales experienced an uptick, and their growth appears to be resuming, it may not necessarily be the case. There is a possibility that, followed by macroeconomic uncertainties, new home sales may come in weaker-than-anticipated. This could pressure the stock price further. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lowe's is exposed to tariffs, and that is a concern. This is another argument for suppressed margins, and if tariffs will remain a concern over the following years, the market may reprice the company at a lower multiple. Because of this, the company is also experiencing cost inflation, which supports my limited upside narrative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering its 12-month top and bottom-line performance, LOW experiences stagnation. However, it also trades at only a 20% discount to the benchmark. This suggests that if the outlook remains cloudy, investors may not be willing to pay a higher premium for the company. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the upside, if none of the above materializes, and tariff risks and concerns fade away, the company could continue trading at a premium, and there may even be room for multiple expansion. I believe that investors should monitor whether an uptick in new home sales was only a short-term blip. If that is not the case, LOW may be able to accelerate its top and bottom-line expansion, which may be bullish for its stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Macro Shifts Appear Promising, But I Remain Cautious — A Hold</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that Lowe's may appear to be an interesting opportunity for long-term investors who may seek to diversify into the retail industry with exposure to real estate markets. For multiple years now, the real estate landscape has been stressed, but recent progress highlighting an uptick in new home sales may be promising and supports a bullish stance for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, it remains trading at elevated multiples, despite experiencing stagnation on both the top and bottom line. This highlights that the market may already be priced in for future growth, which would suggest upside may be limited in the near term. To that, there is a risk that improved consumer spending in real estate was just a one-off blip, which may suggest that investors could reprice the stock at a lower multiple if tailwinds do not materialize.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given this, and a fairly valued stock, I think Lowe's Companies is a Hold. I think the stock may mirror bottom-line expansion, but I also don't believe it could significantly outperform the benchmark without a meaningful revenue growth catalyst. I forecast a $266 price target over the next 12 months, suggesting a 9% upside potential, but unlikely to outperform the broader market. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">35 Wall Street analysts</a> forecast a $282 price target, implying a roughly 18% upside possibility. This is a possibility, but I remain cautious until more data regarding real estate market activity appears.</p>",

The market has been reluctant to push the stock much higher recently, likely because some consider it overvalued. The stock<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> has essentially flatlined since my last article on Broadcom. However, there are still reasons growth investors may want to purchase this stock despite trading at what some consider an elevated valuation.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most significant reason investors may want to invest in Broadcom today is the potential for massive revenue growth acceleration from its artificial intelligence (\"AI\") business. Recently, Chief Executive Officer<span> </span>Hock Tan tied his pay incentives to the company's AI business, with the condition that the AI business achieve certain revenue in 2030. At the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821295-broadcom-inc-avgo-presents-at-goldman-sachs-communacopia-technology-conference-2025\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821295-broadcom-inc-avgo-presents-at-goldman-sachs-communacopia-technology-conference-2025\" target=\"_blank\">Technology Conference 2025</a> on Sept. 9, CEO Tan said:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>As you know, I signed up for an extension of my contract to 2030. With this extension, of course, I get some incentives. One of that incentives that tied to it is tied to - so you guys know AI revenue for Broadcom, very simple. And I need to hit to achieve max on my incentive for 2030, five years from now, give you a sense, AI revenue of exceeding $120 billion, OK? Today, '25, our AI revenue is $20 billion. But that gives you a sense of our belief how strong the demand for compute is in this race towards AI, generative AI, super intelligence.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Suppose you plug those numbers ($20 billion in 2025 and $120 billion in 2030) into a compound annual growth rate (\"CAGR\") calculator. In that case, it results in a 43.1% CAGR over five years—absolutely explosive revenue growth from AI alone. Hock Tan has been the CEO of Broadcom since March 2006, following Avago Technologies' merger with Broadcom and the formation of the new Broadcom Inc. The company has displayed excellent execution during Hock Tan's reign. A bet that Hock Tan can guide Broadcom to $120 billion in AI revenue by 2030 is not a bad bet. It's within the realm of possibility, especially considering the growth of the AI marketplace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">He also noted at the conference that the company initially projected 60% revenue growth for fiscal year (\"FY\") 2026, but now expects that growth rate to accelerate beyond 60%. Typically, when revenue growth accelerates, momentum investors bid up the stock price. Broadcom's report date for fourth quarter 2025 earnings is on Dec. 11. If the company beats analysts' revenue estimates and raises 2026 guidance when it reports fourth-quarter earnings, it may spark a post-earnings rally in the stock—a good reason to invest in the near term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI Compute and networking</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference 2025, CEO Hock Tan explained he views the AI market in two distinct customer groups. The first group (the creators) consists of only a few significant players that include hyperscalers such as Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>), Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), and \"super start-ups\" or labs (like OpenAI, Anthropic) that are creating the Large Language Models (LLMs) and new platforms of the future. Hock Tan estimates that several players in the creator market spend up to $30 billion a year on AI infrastructure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hock Tan describes the creator group at the Goldman Sachs Conference:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>These are the guys who are really making that investment in LLMs, which entail huge amount of R&amp;D, particularly in respect to training, which is just - not just creating that algorithms to create those LLMs and make it work, but to also create the ability and spend on the ability to train huge amounts of data to improve on their journey towards super intelligence as we - for (want) of a better word.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second group is a more fragmented group of AI users, or the enterprise market, consisting of thousands of regular companies, public cloud customers, and government/sovereign entities, who are primarily interested in using AI to improve their businesses and achieve \"productivity gains.\" These users are rarely interested in doing much training. The AI user market is essentially the AI inference market. Hock Tan estimates the AI user market consists of around 10,000 customers today, each spending around $10 million a year, for a total of $100 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CEO Tan also discussed the AI user market at the Goldman conference:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>There's thousands and thousands of companies out there who are looking at AI as a very interesting tool to improve the way they run their business to basically achieve mostly productivity gains, which is truly - and trying to find use case for it and doubling most of them POCs (proof of concepts) right now on AI tools and trying to run AI and whether they get that ability through renting GPUs or buying some and running on-prem, these are that category. And that category of market are largely inference, truly inference. They talk about training. It's limited. Post training, perhaps, test time scaling, but it's all inference. It's looking for use case and trying to get a return on investment, mostly on productivity. And these guys are going to stay largely on merchant silicon, merchant GPU because they're not going to create XPUs, write software stacks to make it work and figure out all these things.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The creator group may have fewer potential customers, but it's still a sizeable market. Broadcom has little interest in marketing to the AI users market or enterprise customers who are primarily interested in using graphics processing units (\"GPUs\") manufactured by Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) or Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>), rather than Broadcom's customized XPUs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the AI chip gets all the hype, Broadcom's biggest advantage in AI infrastructure is its networking products. Not many companies have the resources to compete with Broadcom's networking knowledge, SerDes (Serializer/Deserializer) IP, and deep expertise. SerDes is the technology that moves data between chips at extremely high speeds. Broadcom has pioneered the development and integration of this high-speed IP into its ASICs, making it a key differentiating factor for building large AI clusters (XPUs/custom AI chips). Although many companies have entered the ASIC space over the years, competitors have had difficulty beating Broadcom in the AI infrastructure category because replicating its networking and connectivity technology is difficult.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The LLM Creator market is the only segment that truly pushes the limits of networking, a core Broadcom strength. CEO Hock Tan discussed the importance of networking at the Goldman Conference:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>You are not able to do this generative AI training of this huge database to create this billion, billion parameters models with one single GPU or XPU, no matter how hard you try. You need to create a cluster of them. And the more complex your LLM becomes, the larger your clusters have to be. Then you face yourself a totally different problem. How do you create all this matrix multiplication across, say, 100,000 of the GPU simultaneously. And then you go to 1 million. That's even a bigger headache. That's one of the - that is, in fact, I consider the biggest technology challenge in computing on generative AI as you progress your models higher. And that comes in the other aspect, networking. How do you connect them? How do you have the bandwidth to connect them? How do you schedule the workloads, orchestrate it so that they can all run in parallel. This is more so as much software as the networking side, which is hardware. I think this is one of the biggest challenge towards progression, making massive progress on being able to create super intelligence. How do you get these huge workloads that you're supposed to run on these huge models and be able to train a huge amount of data on a 1 million GPU or XPU simultaneously and converge on a solution.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, AMD and Nvidia, or one of the new players like Groq, Tenstorrent, Lightmatter, Mythic, Hailo, and SambaNova, could build the greatest individual AI chip in the world, and it would all be for naught if they're not networked together optimally. Since networking is Broadcom's bread and butter, with its IP in SerDes and high-performance Ethernet switches like <a href=\"https://www.broadcom.com/products/ethernet-connectivity/switching/strataxgs/bcm78910-series\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.broadcom.com/products/ethernet-connectivity/switching/strataxgs/bcm78910-series\" target=\"_blank\">Tomahawk</a> and <a href=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-ships-jericho4-enabling-distributed-ai-computing-across\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-ships-jericho4-enabling-distributed-ai-computing-across\" target=\"_blank\">Jericho</a>, it has a significant advantage over most companies. The only company that I can think of off the top of my head that has the networking chops to compete with Broadcom is Marvell (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRVL\" title=\"Marvell Technology, Inc.\">MRVL</a>). So, despite press releases from some of its competitors about creating the latest and greatest super-duper chip, some will never be able to overcome Broadcom's networking moat. Customers who buy its hardware, networking, and software understand Broadcom's advantages, and it's unlikely these companies will switch to competitors easily in the near future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Broadcom's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 29.34, well above its three-, five-, seven-, and 10-year medians.

Investors would likely react negatively and sell off the stock.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some of its hyperscaler customers are actively developing their own in-house chips (like Amazon's Trainium/Inferentia). Broadcom's role is to help hyperscalers build their own chips by supplying foundational IP (such as SerDes) and manufacturing expertise. However, as larger customers gain more experience in manufacturing AI chips, they may eventually cut out Broadcom entirely or move to a lower-cost partner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Customer concentration within a few giant \"creators\" also carries the risk that they could gain negotiating leverage by threatening to move their business to competing infrastructure providers with lower prices or other advantages, such as Marvell. Broadcom may have to lower product prices to retain customers, potentially eroding gross margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of Marvell, its fiercest rival in the custom AI chip and high-speed networking market, has already secured major <a href=\"https://www.marvell.com/content/dam/marvell/en/company/assets/marvels-ai-momentum-bolstered-by-design-wins-new-contracts.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.marvell.com/content/dam/marvell/en/company/assets/marvels-ai-momentum-bolstered-by-design-wins-new-contracts.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">design wins in the past</a> with hyperscalers like Amazon, Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), and Microsoft. It's actively challenging Broadcom's market share in this lucrative space. While Broadcom has a solid moat in networking (SerDes, switches), it may not be a permanent technology edge. The technology industry has a long history of upstarts disrupting incumbents, and currently, Broadcom is an incumbent with what may eventually become legacy technology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Broadcom also has other competitors that investors should keep an eye on, with the biggest being Nvidia, which has proprietary networking solutions (InfiniBand/NVLink, now Spectrum-X) and a comprehensive CUDA software platform, making it a challenging rival, even as Broadcom pushes its open Ethernet-based solutions, like <a href=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-introduces-industrys-first-800g-ai-ethernet-nic\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-introduces-industrys-first-800g-ai-ethernet-nic\" target=\"_blank\">Thor Ultra</a>. The danger is that competitors may take enough market share to stunt Broadcom's growth or shrink its margins.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Broadcom remains a buy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Broadcom trades at an elevated valuation and, like many technology stocks, has risks that some conservative investors may want to avoid. Assuming upside from the current level implies an extremely aggressive valuation that may discourage value investors from buying it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, if you're a risk-tolerant investor willing to accept some risk in return for a potential high upside, Broadcom may be for you. Analysts estimate revenue to accelerate over the next year. Typically, the market bids up a company's stock price when its revenue growth accelerates. Its FY 2027 PEG ratio implies the stock has a potential 87.50% rise before reaching a PEG ratio of 2.0, the upper limit at which growth investors generally consider a stock overvalued.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I maintain my buy rating on Broadcom.</p>",
