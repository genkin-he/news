For one thing, there is an aging population. Last October, the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health\" target=\"_blank\">World Health Organization wrote</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>By 2030, 1 in 6 people in the world will be aged 60 years or over. At this time the share of the population aged 60 years and over will increase from 1 billion in 2020 to 1.4 billion.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The pressure this puts on the senior care niche was echoed in a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/senior-caregiving-labor.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/senior-caregiving-labor.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC article</a> this winter, which said:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The senior population is skyrocketing as baby boomers peak and nursing homes start to see more residents.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, as in my prior articles on this stock, I believe there is a natural demand driver for these types of facilities, and although CTRE is the landlord and does not directly deal with patients, it partners with healthcare operators who do that part. For instance, <a href=\"https://investor.caretrustreit.com/files/doc_earnings/2025/q4/presentation/Exhibit-99-2-CTRE-Q4-2025-Financial-Supplement.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investor.caretrustreit.com/files/doc_earnings/2025/q4/presentation/Exhibit-99-2-CTRE-Q4-2025-Financial-Supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Q4 results</a> show that <a href=\"https://ensigngroup.net/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ensigngroup.net/about/\" target=\"_blank\">The Ensign Group</a> is a major operator they work with.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, though, the demand for services in this sector has put a strain on the ability to find a qualified workforce, with even back in 2022 an article in the Natl. Library of Medicine pointing out that:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>...87% of nursing homes have moderate to high levels of staffing shortages, and hiring new staff has been challenging for 98% of nursing homes.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that further supports the argument that demand could continue being a tailwind for this niche, and so I am highly bullish in this section.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Competitive Positioning</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to competitive positioning, CTRE does not directly manage the patients, but it can compete for investors with similar REITs, so here are some metrics to consider.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First off, I picked three publicly traded <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/comparison/new/MCUyQ2N0cmUlMkNsdGMlMkNvaGklMkN3ZWxs\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/comparison/new/MCUyQ2N0cmUlMkNsdGMlMkNvaGklMkN3ZWxs\" target=\"_blank\">REIT comparables</a> in the senior care/skilled nursing niche: LTC Properties (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LTC\" title=\"LTC Properties, Inc.\">LTC</a>), Omega Healthcare Investors (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OHI\" title=\"Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc.\">OHI</a>), and Welltower (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WELL\" title=\"Welltower Inc.\">WELL</a>). In terms of market cap, CTRE is somewhere in the middle, with Welltower being clearly the largest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Though not the biggest, CTRE led in top-line growth with a five-year revenue CAGR of nearly +22%, based on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/comparison/new/MCUyQ2N0cmUlMkNsdGMlMkNvaGklMkN3ZWxs\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/comparison/new/MCUyQ2N0cmUlMkNsdGMlMkNvaGklMkN3ZWxs\" target=\"_blank\">peer data</a>, and it was 2nd in return on equity with an ROE of +9.1%, also impressive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another competitive edge could be its UK expansion. In fact, CareTrust's CEO, Dave Sedgwick, said in an <a href=\"https://www.reit.com/news/video/caretrust-reit-ceo-says-expansion-uk-market-transformative-reit\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.reit.com/news/video/caretrust-reit-ceo-says-expansion-uk-market-transformative-reit\" target=\"_blank\">interview for NAREIT</a> last year that acquiring Care REIT plc was a:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>...transformative deal, marking its first international expansion, as well as adding 135 properties and diversifying its geographic footprint and portfolio mix.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further, we cannot ignore the fact that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTRE/momentum/performance\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTRE/momentum/performance\" target=\"_blank\">momentum data</a> shows CTRE with a 10-year price return of +246%, not only beating the peer group but also edging above a major benchmark like the S&amp;P 500, something I have not seen many REITs I've covered being able to do yet:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/58572054-17720022161849248_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"776\" data-height=\"423\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/58572054-17720022161849248_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"CTRE -

On an annualized basis, the payout ratio was approximately 71% based on fourth quarter 2025 Normalized FFO.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At below 75%, I believe the payout ratio is still reasonable and not getting into dangerous territory, so it would appear they can cover the dividend adequately, and the FFO growth projections and strong margins should continue to support the case for dividend safety going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, think about the fact that this type of REIT is not subject to the same cyclical swings that a hotel REIT or retail REIT could be, which are exposed to consumer spending confidence, seasonal travel and shopping trends, and recessionary factors. It doesn't make those REIT sectors bad, since I invest in them actually, but it just presents a very different risk profile to consider.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, I am bullish on CTRE's dividend story and am including it in my dividend ideas for February.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Metrics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To change things up, here I'll present my valuation and price target worksheet, which I did not include in my initial rating of this stock, yet I think could add some more color to the thesis.

Wall St. target</a> of +7.2% upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, I've already shown that CTRE has strong and improving margins, a positive earnings guidance for the near term, and beats several peers on ROE, so I would call this an undervaluation opportunity with upside potential, and hence a <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"68330436\">buy</em>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Technical Charting</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another new feature since my initial rating on this stock, to add an additional angle this time, is to consider technical chart patterns, with the goal of pattern recognition in price movements.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_d72fa33ec2e4300ed3882955adf10c67.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_d72fa33ec2e4300ed3882955adf10c67.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_d72fa33ec2e4300ed3882955adf10c67.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_d72fa33ec2e4300ed3882955adf10c67.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The patterns that immediately stick out are the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"68330436\">buy</em> signal (golden cross pattern) that formed this summer, after which both moving averages, the 50-day and 200-day SMA, have been parallel and trending upward. In addition, the share price has mostly remained above the 50-day, which is acting as a strong support so far. In fact, that support was tested, it seems, a few times, and the price just came back up again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am inclined to say <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"68330436\">buy</em> based on this pattern since it seems like continuing bullish momentum rather than trend consolidation, and certainly no bearish signals are in sight.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interestingly, this technical pattern actually supports and bolsters the rest of my article, which is based on fundamentals rather than technicals, and strengthens the overall bullish thesis even more.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks and Challenges to Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One factor that could challenge my strong <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"68330436\">buy</em> rating that has not been otherwise covered in this article is payor risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although this applies more to this REIT's tenant operators since they are the ones getting reimbursed, it certainly can impact the REIT if its major tenants are under pressure to accept lower rates from insurers and Medicare/Medicaid, thereby impacting their own cash flow. Experienced investors and analysts in this niche, I think, are equally paying attention to this REIT's tenants, like Ensign and others, as they are to the REIT, so payor reimbursement trends come into play, and when it comes to Medicare/Medicaid, those are also subject to political decisions at the state and federal level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is more of a sector risk than one limited to this REIT, since all of its peers could be in the same boat, so it is important for sector investors to bake that into their risk management strategy. There is also not much of a mitigating factor here since this niche is literally fully exposed to tenants with such payor risk, unlike REITs that have stores, apartments, or data centers, for instance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To wrap things up, in my follow-up on CTRE this time, I am actually upgrading it from my last few articles after considering new data and additional angles, and this time I'm agreeing with <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTRE/ratings/sell-side-ratings\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTRE/ratings/sell-side-ratings\" target=\"_blank\">Wall St.'s strong <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"68330436\">buy</em> consensus</a> (as of Wednesday).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To summarize, CTRE is a compelling dividend idea that is also convincing as a growth story and offers the opportunity for portfolio exposure to the niche of healthcare REITs focused on a high-demand segment: skilled nursing and senior care, which shows plenty of reason for further upside potential.</p>",

We believe our broad appeal comes from our large selection of licenses and properties that we apply across a variety of product categories and brands. We do not limit ourselves by targeting discrete demographics such as only collectors or children seeking the latest (and often short-lived) toy craze. We strive to have something for everyone by offering figures and other product categories including bags, wallets, apparel, plush, accessories, homewares and more. We expect to continue to look for ways to diversify our product offerings to reach an even broader group of consumers.</p> <p>In addition to offering multiple properties and product categories, we create and sell a variety of unique brands that have their own look and feel. Our brand portfolio includes Core Collectible (which include Pop! Vinyl, as well as other branded lines such as Soda, Bitty Pop!, and Pop! Yourself), Loungefly (softlines including bags, wallets, backpacks and apparel)</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main products are the Funko Pop plastic toys that are in the collectible toy category, along with things like Star Wars figures, Pokémon, and Pop Mart toys. They also have a wide array of Loungefly higher-end backpacks and apparel. The IP leasing catalog is vast. If the rights to use those alone could be carried over to a buyer, that could be valuable in and of itself. The market reaction to the news of an activist stepping in was a big pop and then a subsiding.

The Popmart stores and brands are headquartered in Beijing, China, and the company is listed in Hong Kong. Many of the artists and creators of the themes are from China.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Popmart stores are now all over the US and the world.</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Popmarts are now \"popping up\" all over the world, and the world has a wide reach.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why all the fuss about Popmart</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is because I believe the size and type of vinyl that Funko Pops use is pretty similar to what you'll find on Popmart blind box toys, minus the fur. This could be a capacity sale combined with a licensing agreement acquisition story.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although Funko designs the toys in the US, they are manufactured in China, Vietnam, and Mexico, so we can assume that China-based Popmart would be familiar with the company's manufacturing and logistics operations already.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another competitor that may want the capacity could also be <strong>Miniso</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MNSO\" title=\"MINISO Group Holding Limited\">MNSO</a>). This Guangzhou, China based company is listed in the US and has a replica business model to Popmart. Toy stores all over the US and abroad are stocked with Asian-themed blind box toys and accessories.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An activist investor buying a stake and publicly promoting a sale exploration tells me they could see the assets, licensing, and logistics as key marketing components. The existing pop toys and backpacks are not gaining any further market share and falling out of style, it appears. My analysis is that the manufacturing assets are the key value proposition for more popular toy brands to acquire.</p>",

This compares to its historical averages in the mid-20x range. I believe the premium is justified, especially given TJX’s ongoing appeal in the current high-priced consumer environment, as well as its strong operating results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the SA community is broadly neutral on TJX, analysts on Wall Street are seeing additional upside remaining. Granted, the potential is less than 10% from current trading levels based on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TJX/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">current price target</a>. I believe that TJX can certainly reach this target, but it’s not exactly an impressive rate of return, in my view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49921492-17720702371325748_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"873\" data-height=\"294\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49921492-17720702371325748_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha - Average Price Target Of TJX Stock\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"216\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49921492-17720702371325748_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49921492-17720702371325748_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49921492-17720702371325748_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49921492-17720702371325748_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha - Average Price Target Of TJX Stock</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TJX Q4 Results Recap</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TJX closed out the year exactly the way investors have come to expect, and that is by outperforming.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20412856-the-tjx-companies-inc-reports-q4-and-full-year-fy26-results-q4-comp-sales-growth-pretax#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">Q4 topline</a> rose 9%, while consolidated comp sales increased a very strong 5%, ahead of plan and on top of a 5% increase last year. That’s a tough comparison made to look easy, in my view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Importantly, the comp was driven by both higher average ticket and increased transactions, a clear sign that traffic remains healthy and consumers are responding to the value proposition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability was just as impressive, in my view. Adjusted gross margin expanded 60 basis points to 31.1%, helped by stronger merchandise margins and expense leverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pretax margin improved to 12.2%, also up 60 basis points, and adjusted EPS came in at $1.43, up 16% YOY and $0.05/share <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556613-tjx-non-gaap-eps-of-1_43-beats-by-0_05-revenue-of-17_74b-beats-by-360m\">ahead of expectations</a>. Shrink improvement was another highlight, with management noting levels are now essentially back to pre-COVID norms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Full-year results justify TJX’s current stock outperformance, in my view. Total sales, for example, surpassed the +$60B mark and EPS climbed 11% YOY. In addition, every division posted comp growth of 4% or better.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Is The Outlook For TJX Stock?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874698-the-tjx-companies-inc-tjx-q4-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">Looking ahead</a>, the guidance remains positive with a hint of a ‘back to earth’ vibe as it relates to the growth trajectory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Drilling down into it, for FY27, TJX is calling for comp sales growth of 2% to 3%, a step down from the 5% pace delivered this year. In addition, total sales are expected to rise 4% to 5%, with EPS projected between $4.93 and $5.02, representing growth of 4% to 6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margins are also expected to remain healthy. Gross margin is guided to improve modestly to 31.1%–31.2%, driven by higher merchandise margins, while pretax margin is expected to be flat to up slightly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What’s important for TJX is that they continue to invest in growth, and it appears they will be meeting that expectation in the new fiscal year. The company plans to open 146 net new stores, complete more than 500 remodels, and spend over +$2B in CAPEX to support long-term expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, shareholders will continue to benefit from meaningful capital returns, including a planned 13% dividend increase and up to +$2.8B in buybacks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Is TJX Stock A Buy, Sell, Or Hold?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There’s no question in my mind that TJX remains one of the best bets in retail. I actually had titled one of my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4580190-the-tjx-companies-off-price-remains-the-best-bet-in-retail\">past articles</a> this tag in early 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Backing up this statement today is that traffic trends remain healthy, margins are expanding, and management is confidently investing in long-term growth. This is exactly what you want to see from a best-in-class off-price retailer, in my view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, shares have run up in a significant way since my early calls on the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With shares trading at over 30x forward earnings and sitting near the top end of the 52-week range, I believe much of the operational strength is already reflected in the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The guidance for FY27 calls for solid, but more normalized, mid-single-digit earnings growth. That type of growth profile simply does not leave a wide margin of safety at current valuation levels, in my view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Could shares grind higher? Absolutely. The management team has earned the benefit of the doubt from me on that. But with consensus price targets implying less than 10% upside and the multiple well above historical norms, I don’t see a compelling risk-reward setup here.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For long-term holders who are likely sitting on hefty gains, I believe TJX remains a core, high-quality name worth owning. For new investment, however, patience may be rewarded. At current levels, I view TJX as a ‘hold’, waiting for a more attractive entry point.</p>",

Surprisingly, revenue and adjusted earnings per<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> share both came in above what analysts anticipated. What's more, management is forecasting further growth in 2026 to take financial performance higher than what the business has seen over the last couple of years now.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conceptually, this is great. And what's even better is that, on both an absolute basis and relative to other similar firms, the stock is priced at levels that look cheap. Naturally, this would draw my attention. In the past, however, the market has not really agreed with me all that much. In fact, back in May of 2025, I ended up <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4781487-bjs-restaurants-investors-should-be-optimistic\">upgrading the stock</a> from a ‘hold’ to a ‘buy’. Since then, however, the stock has risen only 9.1%, falling woefully short of the 22.8% increase that the S&amp;P 500 has achieved. But honestly, considering how cheap the stock is and factoring in its continued growth, I firmly stand by my previous assessment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A great way to end 2025</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The final quarter of the 2025 fiscal year was, in many respects, a positive time for shareholders of BJ's Restaurants. Management reported revenue for the quarter of $355.4 million. That happened to be an increase of 3.2% over the $344.3 million the company reported a year earlier, and it exceeded analysts' <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BJRI/earnings\">estimates</a> by $1.6 million. Some of this rise was driven by an increase in the number of locations in operation from 218 to 219. But that's not the only thing that added to the top line growth. The company also reported comparable restaurant sales growth of 2.6%, pushing overall comparable sales up to 2% for 2025 in its entirety compared to the 1.2% achieved from 2024 to 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887058842947_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1974\" data-height=\"856\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887058842947_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"278\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"278\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887058842947_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887058842947_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887058842947_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887058842947_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Compilation - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to management, traffic growth was particularly robust, jumping 4.5% year over year. This was fueled by continued innovation when it comes to the company's menu. For instance, during the quarter, it built on its seasonal Pizookie momentum, specifically through the return of its Monkey Bread Pizookie and the introduction of its Dubai Chocolate Pizookie. The latter of these also entitled patrons to an accompanying martini. The firm also launched its renovated pizza platform that management said is currently resonating well with guests and achieving consistent performance. This does not mean that management is focused only on expanding its menu. In fact, the company ended 2025 with a net reduction of six menu items and four ingredient SKUs. Plus, it is investing more into not only its social media presence, specifically through relevant product news, but also it is relying on word of mouth. The fact that the company completed 19 remodels throughout 2025, bringing the total number of remodels systemwide to just shy of 50%, means that customers are having a new experience that is certainly bringing them back time and time again. These changes have included certain technological improvements as well, such as tagging and tracking its equipment. The goal here is to remain more operationally efficient, and as you will see shortly, that is certainly having a positive impact on the bottom line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887178985512_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1704\" data-height=\"894\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887178985512_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"336\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"336\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887178985512_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887178985512_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887178985512_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887178985512_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>&gt;Author's Compilation - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of profits, earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.58. While that represented a meaningful improvement over the $0.23 in losses that the company incurred the previous year, it did, unfortunately, fall short of expectations that analysts had set to the tune of $0.03. But still, the fact that the company went from a net loss of $5.3 million to a net profit of $12.6 million is most certainly something to write home about. Adjusted earnings per share did considerably better, rising from $0.47 to $0.66. In addition to exceeding analysts’ estimates by $0.04, the improvement meant a rise in adjusted net income from $11.1 million to $14.3 million. I wish I could say that we had data regarding operating cash flow. But at this time, we don't. We do know, however, that on a year-over-year basis, EBITDA for the company expanded from $33.1 million to $35.6 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886741767344_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1980\" data-height=\"840\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886741767344_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"272\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"272\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886741767344_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886741767344_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886741767344_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886741767344_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>&gt;Author's Compilation - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the chart above, you can see financial results for 2025 in their entirety compared to 2024. Revenue, earnings, and adjusted earnings all increased nicely. Also on the rise ended up being EBITDA. What's really awesome is that management expects continued momentum into 2026. Management continues to focus on building engagement with its seasonal Pizookies. Plus, it is likely to continue rolling out innovative products. That's not just speculation. In fact, management specified in their <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-bjs-restaurants-q4-2025-sees-eps-beat-stock-steady-93CH-4526167\" rel=\"nofollow\">latest earnings call</a> that they are in the early stages of testing refreshes to their burger category and chicken sandwiches. The goal of all of this is to build on the foundations of the company laid in 2025. And if that goes according to plan, overall comparable sales for 2026 should rise by another 1% to 3%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From that, we should expect EBITDA of somewhere between $140 million and $150 million for the year. That compares nicely to the $134.1 million the company reported for 2025. In all likelihood, this would mean a rise in adjusted net profits from $51.1 million to $55.3 million. And it should mean growth in adjusted operating cash flow to around $179.3 million. As I mentioned earlier in this article, management has not provided comprehensive cash flow data yet. But this growth was based on projecting out results for the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same time in 2024. That would have meant a rise in adjusted operating cash flow from $141.9 million in 2024 to $165.8 million last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886907896712_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2050\" data-height=\"900\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886907896712_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trading Multiples\" width=\"640\" height=\"281\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"281\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886907896712_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886907896712_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886907896712_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886907896712_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>&gt;Author's Compilation - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using these estimates, we can see in the chart above how shares of the company are priced at the moment. Honestly, these are very low multiples. This is especially true when it comes to the cash flow figures. Relative to other similar restaurant companies, the stock is certainly trading on the cheaper end of the spectrum as well. In that same chart, you can see how it compares to five other similar terms. On a price-to-earnings basis, only two of the five companies are cheaper than it is. One of them is cheaper on a price to operating cash flow basis. Meanwhile, when it came to the EV to EBITDA approach, BJ's Restaurants ended up being cheaper than any of these companies.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on all the data provided right now, I must say that I am feeling very optimistic about BJ's Restaurants. Management has done an exceptional job as of late. For some reason, the market is still resistant to this candidate. The firm has increased since I last wrote about it. But it has not increased anywhere near enough to justify anything other than a bullish outlook. Given this, I believe that maintaining BJ's Restaurants as a very solid ‘buy’ candidate is the right move.</p>",

The S&amp;P 500 Index increased 2.7% during the quarter, bringing full-year returns to 17.9%. Performance was shaped by the evolving monetary policy backdrop following the Federal Reserve's (\"Fed\") initial rate cut in September, with additional cuts in October and December, as investors balanced expectations for a gradual easing cycle against evidence of slowing, but still resilient economic fundamentals. The Fed maintained its data-dependent messaging throughout the quarter, signaling willingness to ease further as inflation continued moderating toward its target while labor market conditions softened at the margin. This approach helped contain interest rate volatility and provided support for equity valuations.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Corporate earnings remained broadly positive despite moderating growth rates. Forward guidance pointed to continued, albeit more measured, profit expansion into 2026. AI and technology-related sectors continued to drive earnings leadership, though contributions broadened to include Health Care, Industrials, and Consumer Discretionary stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mid-cap stocks lagged both large- and small-cap stocks. The Russell 1000® Index was up 2.4%, and the Russell 2000® returned 2.2%, while the Russell Midcap® Index was up just 0.2%. Value stocks – as measured by the Russell Indexes – outperformed growth stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nine of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors posted positive returns in the fourth quarter. Sector leadership was concentrated in the Health Care and Communication Services sectors, while Real Estate and Utilities lagged.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the fourth quarter, the Harbor Mid Cap Value Fund (Institutional Class, \"Fund\") returned 4.07%, outperforming its benchmark, the Russell Midcap® Value Index, which returned 1.42%. Among mid-caps, value stocks outperformed growth stocks, as the Russell Midcap® Growth Index returned -3.7%. The outperformance of value stocks had a positive impact on relative results given our value discipline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We take limited sector and industry bets and look to add value primarily from bottom-up stock selection. During the fourth quarter, stock selection accounted for most of the value added, however, sector selection was also positive. From a sector perspective, the Fund's underweight to Utilities and Real Estate added value. Stock selection added value in several sectors, particularly Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, and Financials.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Contributors &amp; Detractors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following strong performance in the third quarter, Information Technology holding Sandisk (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SNDK\" title=\"Sandisk Corporation\">SNDK</a>) significantly outperformed again in the fourth quarter. AI-driven demand for storage led to strong earnings and increases in revenue growth and margins. We trimmed our position in Sandisk given the run-up in the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other top-performing holdings were in the Consumer Discretionary sector – General Motors (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GM\" title=\"General Motors Company\">GM</a>) and Expedia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXPE\" title=\"Expedia Group, Inc.\">EXPE</a>). General Motors performed well after posting strong full-year results driven by record truck sales. The company continues to return capital to investors through stock buybacks and dividend increases. Expedia, which was a recent purchase, also posted strong results and raised the outlook going forward. We added to our exposure to Expedia and continue to hold both stocks in the Fund.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jazz Pharmaceuticals (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JAZZ\" title=\"Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc\">JAZZ</a>), in the Health Care sector, was a top performer, advancing nearly 30% driven by strong third quarter performance and positive clinical trial results for one of its cancer drugs. We continue to hold the company in the Fund.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other top contributors included underweights to momentum-based stocks that are in the benchmark, Robinhood Markets (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HOOD\" title=\"Robinhood Markets, Inc.\">HOOD</a>) and Coinbase Global (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COIN\" title=\"Coinbase Global, Inc.\">COIN</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While several Fund holdings struggled – including NewMarket (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEU\" title=\"NewMarket Corporation\">NEU</a>) in the Materials sector, HP (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPQ\" title=\"HP Inc.\">HPQ</a>) in the Information Technology sector, and Harley-Davidson (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HOG\" title=\"Harley-Davidson, Inc.\">HOG</a>) and PulteGroup (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PHM\" title=\"PulteGroup, Inc.\">PHM</a>) in the Consumer Discretionary sector – the most significant detractor was our underweight to Warner Bros. Discovery (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBD\" title=\"Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.\">WBD</a>), which is in the benchmark and was up nearly 50% on acquisition activity. NewMarket struggled with general weakness in the petroleum additives business, one of the larger portions of its revenue. We continue to hold the stock in the Fund. Harley-Davidson struggled after reporting sharp declines in motorcycle revenue, increased costs, and pricing pressure. We continue to hold Harley-Davidson in the Fund. PulteGroup, in the homebuilding industry, struggled due to slowing orders and margin pressures despite a slight decrease in mortgage rates. We continue to hold PulteGroup in the Fund. HP has not benefited much from the AI frenzy like other technology companies. The company has seen rising costs and projected lower-than-expected earnings for 2026. We did not make any changes to our position in HP and continue to hold the stock in the Fund.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Buys &amp; Sells</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We initiated a position in Garrett Motion (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GTX\" title=\"Garrett Motion Inc.\">GTX</a>), an automotive parts and equipment company in the Consumer Discretionary sector. The company designs, manufactures, and sells turbocharger and electric boosting technologies for commercial vehicles. Garrett ranks high on multiple cash flow and forecast earnings measures on our model. The company typically pays a dividend and has been aggressively buying back stock, which we view positively. Price momentum during the past 12 months has been strong as has operating momentum, placing its momentum scores near the top decile. Overall, the stock ranks in the top 5% in our stock-ranking universe, which led to the fourth quarter purchase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also initiated a position in EnerSys (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENS\" title=\"EnerSys\">ENS</a>) in the Industrials sector. EnerSys designs, manufactures, and distributes energy systems and batteries to customers worldwide. The stock ranks high on multiple cash flow and forecast earnings measure — our two most important blocks of valuation. The company typically pays a dividend and has been aggressively buying back stock, which we view positively. Price momentum over the past 12 months has been strong. In addition, several indicators of operating momentum are also attractive, with improving operating margins and growth in sales. Overall, the stock ranks in the top 5% in our stock-ranking universe, which led to the fourth quarter purchase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We sold our position in Electronic Arts (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EA\" title=\"Electronic Arts Inc.\">EA</a>) in the Communication Services sector. Electronic Arts did well in 2025, advancing approximately 40% for the year. In late September, the company announced an agreement to be acquired by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SVLKF\" title=\"Silver Lake Resources Limited\">SVLKF</a>), and Affinity Partners for $55 billion. The Fund often benefits from takeovers, as the companies we hold tend to be attractively priced, solid businesses that are undervalued, as was the case with Electronic Arts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We trimmed our position in Amkor Technology (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMKR\" title=\"Amkor Technology, Inc.\">AMKR</a>) in the Information Technology sector. Amkor has done well in recent years, benefiting from the surging demand in AI and as a result has become less attractive from a valuation standpoint. While the stock still generates good cash flow, both earnings and cash flow have not kept up with the increase in stock price. Stock price momentum has been very strong but the decline in fundamentals (valuation) led us to sell the position.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sector Underweights and Overweights</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Fund's sector exposures are driven by valuations, as we will overweight those sectors where we find the most attractive stocks from a valuation standpoint and underweight those sectors and industries where we have difficulty finding cheap stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Fund's most significant overweights relative to the value benchmark are to the Consumer Discretionary and Financials sectors. Within the Consumer Discretionary sector, the Fund is overweight homebuilders, automotive parts, automotive retail, and broadline retail. Among Financials, the Fund is overweight consumer finance, commercial &amp; residential mortgage finance, asset management &amp; custody banks, regional banks, and property &amp; casualty insurance. The most significant underweights relative to the value benchmark are to Industrials, Materials, Utilities, and Real Estate.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">U.S. equity markets finished the year strong; however, mid-cap stocks were only slightly positive in the fourth quarter and up just over 10% for the year compared to nearly 18% for the S&amp;P 500 Index. Markets in 2025 were led by almost anything AI-related, driving up valuations for chipmakers and software firms building AI platforms. While technology-related stocks saw the largest gains, other sectors of the market also benefited from the broadening of the market advance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even though AI-related technology stocks may appear priced to perfection, we continue to identify opportunities among mid- and smaller-capitalization value stocks. The Fund has outperformed the value benchmark in four of the past five years, with the only exception being 2024, when the Fund matched the return of the value benchmark. Even with strong relative performance, the Fund remains attractively priced relative to the benchmark. The Fund seeks to hold high-quality, profitable companies that generate cash, pay dividends, and repurchase shares. While large-cap U.S. stocks appear quite expensive, the mid- and small-cap segments of the market continue to trade at attractive multiples, particularly value-oriented stocks.

Stock markets are volatile and equity values can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market and economic conditions. The value of securities selected using quantitative analysis can react differently to issuer, political, market, and economic developments than the market as a whole or securities selected using only fundamental analysis. The factors used in quantitative analysis and the weight placed on those factors may not be predictive of a security's value. In addition, any model may contain flaws or the model may not perform as anticipated.

(If either the portfolio or the benchmark has no position in a given group, allocation effect is the lone effect.) A group's allocation effect equals the average percent capitalization of the portfolio's group minus the average percent cap of the benchmark's group times the total return of the benchmark group minus the total return of the benchmark.</p> <p>Average Weight is the dollar value (price times the shares held) of the security or group, divided by the total dollar value of the entire portfolio displayed as a percentage. It is calculated as the simple arithmetic average of daily values.</p> <p>Contribution to Return is the contribution of a security or group to the overall portfolio return. It is calculated as the security weight multiplied by the daily security return linked daily across the reporting period.</p> <p>Currency Contribution is Total Return in USD subtracting out the Local Returns.</p> <p>Local Returns are the Total Return of the portfolio or benchmark using the local currency.</p> <p>Selection Effect is the portion of portfolio excess return attributable to choosing different securities within groups from the benchmark. A group's security selection effect equals the average weight of the benchmark's group times the total return of the portfolio's group minus the total return of the benchmark's group.</p> <p>Total Effect is the sum of Allocation Effect and Selection Effect. The total effect represents the opportunity cost of what was done in a group relative to the overall portfolio. It is not just the difference between percent contribution in the portfolio and benchmark. At the overall portfolio level, the two numbers are equal. At the group level, they can be different.</p> <p>Total Return is the price change of a security or group including dividends accrued over the report period (or the in-portfolio return) which includes only the time period that each security was in the portfolio.</p> </td></tr></table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-presentation paywall-full-content\" data-id=\"123074\" data-name=\"Index 1_Index 2_merged.pdf\"></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.harborcapital.com/static/eaf8946f93f506ec5b07f55487b0830e/Mid_Cap_Value_Fund_Quarterly_Report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

This is a good opportunity to see where the business itself stands, but also importantly a chance to reexamine the Bitcoin side of things, because the price of Bitcoins in February of 2026 isn’t what it was even a few short months ago.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth Is Meaningful, But Bitcoin Losses Are the Story in Q4</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After positive quarters in which Hut 8’s profits were more or less entirely a function of their digital assets (which is to say, Bitcoin) appreciating in value, Q4 saw them not just turn to loss, but decidedly so. Once again, the bottom line is driven overwhelmingly by what the price of Bitcoin did, going down in this case.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Q4 2024</p></td> <td><p>Q4 2025</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Revenue</p></td> <td><p>$31.7 million</p></td> <td><p>$88.5 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Gross Profit</p></td> <td><p>$11.4 million</p></td> <td><p>$53.5 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Gain on Digital Assets</p></td> <td><p>$308 million</p></td> <td><p>($402 million)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Operating Income</p></td> <td><p>$282 million</p></td> <td><p>($435 million)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Net Income</p></td> <td><p>$152 million</p></td> <td><p>($280 million)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Adjusted EBITDA</p></td> <td><p>$311 million</p></td> <td><p>($348 million)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GAAP EPS</p></td> <td><p>$1.37</p></td> <td><p>($2.53)</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20412645-hut-8-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results\">press release</a> from Q4 earnings)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top line growth is meaningful year over year here, of course, but once again the Gain on Digital Assets line dwarfs everything else, and by the time we get to net income we’re left with either positive earnings that are exclusively from that gain, as in 2024, or a net loss that is the loss on digital assets compounded with further operating losses from the rest of the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One could argue, indeed, that the earnings we were seeing in past quarters are largely illusory, because the gains are entirely on paper in estimations of what digital assets are worth, and since the company never seems willing to divest those assets when they appreciate, they’re just gains until we get a quarter like this past one, where the price drops and suddenly they’re booking a loss.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Which isn’t to say that the Bitcoin holdings are worthless. As Hut 8 moves to redefine itself away from its crypto business they managed to bring in some positive cash flow from the creation of the American Bitcoin stock. But such gains are not something we can expect them to be able to repeat, nor are they something to judge the overall business around.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash Flow and the Margins of the Business</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Putting aside the Bitcoin question for a minute, we should look at a breakdown of the revenue by different segments of the company. The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874565-hut-8-corp-hut-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">conference call comment</a> was quite accurate declaring that Compute is the company’s “real growth engine” of the company’s business, and indeed, as it grows the margin of that segment has remained the strongest.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Revenue</p></td> <td><p>Cost</p></td> <td><p>Margin</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Power</p></td> <td><p>$5.0 million</p></td> <td><p>$5.4 million</p></td> <td><p>(8.0%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Digital Infrastructure</p></td> <td><p>$1.6 million</p></td> <td><p>$1.4 million</p></td> <td><p>12.5%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Compute</p></td> <td><p>$81.9 million</p></td> <td><p>$28.2 million</p></td> <td><p>65.6%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total</p></td> <td><p>$88.5 million</p></td> <td><p>$35.0 million</p></td> <td><p>60.5%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20412645-hut-8-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results\">press release</a> from Q4 earnings)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From the point of view of revenue, Compute is by far the largest source, and the highest margin of the bunch. The revenue more than doubled year over year, from $31.7 million in 2024, and the margin maintained strength. So long as they are able to continue to grow the Compute segment going forward, it’s clear that’s the right decision to focus on, and the company seems to believe that AI demand for such services is going to allow them to grow that capacity into 2026 and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, Hut 8 stands as an over $6 billion market cap company, and for the entire fiscal year, their overall revenue was only $235 million, with gross costs of around $108 million. That’s a price/sales of 26.07, which is both enormous compared to the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUT/valuation/metrics\">sector median</a> of 3.20 and much higher than Hut 8’s own 5-year average of 9.95.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That problem is compounded because once you get through the gross costs and into the operating costs, that revenue is more than entirely burned through. Noteworthy is that operating cash flow in 2025 actually was worse, even though the revenue and gross margin were substantially higher.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>FY 2024</p></td> <td><p>FY 2025</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Revenue</p></td> <td><p>$162 million</p></td> <td><p>$235 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Gross Profit</p></td> <td><p>$75.8 million</p></td> <td><p>$127 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Operating Cash Flow</p></td> <td><p>($68.5 million)</p></td> <td><p>($139 million)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Investing Cash Flow</p></td> <td><p>($188 million)</p></td> <td><p>($754 million)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Financing Cash Flow</p></td> <td><p>$312 million</p></td> <td><p>$856 million</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(source: Latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/170426851\">10-K</a> from SEC)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Herein lies the problem: Hut 8 is growing, but the top line revenue is still paltry for a company their size, and that growth isn’t bringing them closer to operating break-even so far. When trying estimate the underlying value of Hut 8 we have to include not only their tangible assets, which are largely Bitcoins and depreciating equipment, but also what the cash generation potential of the business is actually worth. In this case, the latter is seemingly worth very little at present. That could change, but for now, it’s not a $6 billion business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the other cash flow lines, we see Investing Cash Flow is strongly negative, both because of substantial CapEx in both years ($120 million in 2024 and roughly $197 million in 2025) which, again, operations aren’t able to pay for, and because they continue to spend large amounts of money buying more Bitcoins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Financing Cash Flow line is where Hut 8 is ultimately paying for all this, and in both cases that included issuing more debt, though also issuing more shares of common stock, which is obviously going to have dilutive consequences for investors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Underlying Value on the Balance Sheet</h2> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p>Cash and Equivalents</p></td> <td><p>$44.9 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Current Assets</p></td> <td><p>$408 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Current Liabilities</p></td> <td><p>$376 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Digital Assets</p></td> <td><p>$1.3 billion</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Property and Equipment</p></td> <td><p>$643 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Shareholder Equity</p></td> <td><p>$1.42 billion</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(source: Latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/170426851\">10-K</a> from SEC)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hut 8 has a modest balance sheet all told, in that they have a not great but sufficient current ratio of 1.09, and a price/book ratio of 4.31, which isn’t hugely higher than the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUT/valuation/metrics\">sector median</a> of 3.51.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">None of this would be immediately objectionable if Hut 8 was a business with positive operating cash flow. With that not being the case, however, valuation has to be justified almost entirely through digital assets. That raises the question of both risk and potential upside, and we find that despite restructuring itself substantially, that’s still a matter of Bitcoin prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We saw in Q4 that if Bitcoin prices depreciate bottom line is going to go down with it, irrespective of how the rest of the company is executing. On the other hand, if Bitcoin prices quickly rebounded and tested new highs, history suggests that investors would reward Hut 8 shareholders on the basis on the substantial assets they’re holding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside of the digital assets, however, there’s not much here, as Hut 8 also has growing debt and equipment that includes a lot of the type of technology that depreciates rapidly over time. Here again, a balance sheet with a lot of such equipment would be easier to justify if Hut 8 was using that equipment to generate cash flow, but so far they simply aren’t.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hope Springs Eternal Even If Bitcoin Doesn’t</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hut 8 has growth prospects in its business, and conceivably there is a future in which their GPU-as-a-service business model grows to the point that they are able to generate good cash flow with it. The gross margin in their Compute segment reflects that. It’s just right now that segment is far too small for a company of their size, and growth remains a work in progress.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m going to reiterate a hold rating on Hut 8, even though I feel that the stock is as it stands somewhat overpriced for what you’re getting, because the growth potential of their business can’t be discounted, and the market seemingly is willing to pay a substantial multiple for exposure to Bitcoin price increases. I honestly think the path of least resistance for Bitcoin bulls would be to buy Bitcoins, but clearly there is a market for miners, and even in the case of Hut 8, former miners.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Q4 conference call shows that the corporate officers remains highly bullish about the direction they’re taking Hut 8. I don’t think the current share price is particularly enticing, but those who believe in the business model should keep a close eye on how they grow and, importantly, how soon they are able to get to operating break-even, because the future of this company depends heavily on getting there.</p>",

An author of a recent <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871702-saas-apocalypse-the-law-of-the-strongest-crushing-the-weak\">Seeking Alpha article</a> explained their reasoning for selling Salesforce (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRM\" title=\"Salesforce, Inc.\">CRM</a>) and FactSet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FDS\" title=\"FactSet Research Systems Inc.\">FDS</a>) due to the SaaSpocalypse risk:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I don’t think that AI [Artificial Intelligence] will bankrupt every SaaS company, but most of them will face a turning point. What has worked in the past might not work in the future, and since the technological innovations are so fast, I decided to sell both companies [Salesforce and FactSet] in early January (lucky timing in hindsight). This doesn’t mean that Salesforce and FactSet can’t generate significant returns; it just means that these two businesses now present a risk/reward ratio that no longer fits my risk tolerance.</blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors are concerned that autonomous AI agents might reduce demand for \"seat-based\" licensed software from SaaS companies, which reduces recurring revenue per user (or \"seat\") accessing a digital software tool or platform. In early February, Anthropic released the Claude <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/webinars/future-of-ai-at-work-introducing-cowork\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cowork AI agent</a>, which may eliminate human jobs and, in theory, harm some SaaS companies' recurring revenue. Zscaler's stock dropped amid concerns that its Annual Recurring Revenue (”ARR”) growth could decelerate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, Zscaler already has an AI agent licensing program through <a href=\"https://help.zscaler.com/ai-guard/what-ai-guard\" rel=\"nofollow\">AI Guard</a>. The <a href=\"https://help.zscaler.com/logs-fair-use/zscaler-ai-guard-licensing-and-fair-use\" rel=\"nofollow\">company's website</a> states that AI Guard \"is licensed based on a platform subscription fee and the number of tokens purchased for the subscription term in an order.\" Since <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/23/ai-robots-outnumber-workers-agents-few-decades-citi.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">some believe</a> AI agents will eventually outnumber human workers, Zscaler potentially has a large pool of non-human AI agents to generate revenue from, replacing revenue lost due to the SaaSpocalypse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because Zscaler could make money from Agentic AI, this recent dip might be a good chance to buy the stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI Security as a Significant New Revenue Pillar</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the market is currently highly concerned that AI might be a deal-breaker for investing in Zscaler, it has actually become a concrete financial contributor, enough that management considers AI Security its third revenue growth pillar, alongside its original pillar of <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/products-and-solutions/zero-trust-exchange-zte\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Trust Everywhere</a> and its second pillar of <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/products-and-solutions/data-security\" rel=\"nofollow\">Data Security Everywhere.</a></p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-1771762890643424_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1149\" data-height=\"640\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-1771762890643424_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The image shows Zscaler's platform solutions.\" width=\"640\" height=\"356\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"356\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-1771762890643424_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-1771762890643424_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-1771762890643424_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-1771762890643424_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Corporate IR Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zscaler's AI Security can be broken down into two buckets: Security for AI apps and Agentic Operations.

Under ITOps, the company names <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/products-and-solutions/zscaler-digital-experience-zdx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zscaler Digital Experience</a>™ (ZDX), a service that enables IT teams to detect, troubleshoot, and resolve user and customer experience issues across devices and software, and <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/product-insights/step-future-zdx-3-exciting-new-features-zdx-copilot-data-explorer-and-hosted\" rel=\"nofollow\">ZDX CoPilot</a>, an AI-powered virtual assistant for the ZDX platform. Although the company has yet to announce further plans in ITOps, it appears to be leaning toward making all IT operations autonomous. So, investors should look out for further services under the ITOps umbrella.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SecOps combines IT operations and information security to strengthen an organization's cybersecurity posture by providing tools to help the CISO (Chief Information Security Officer) assess risks to the company's assets. Some of these tools include <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/resources/solution-briefs/risk360.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Risk360</a>, a service that shows an organization's top cyber risk exposures and possible financial impacts. Other tools include <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/products-and-solutions/business-insights\" rel=\"nofollow\">Business Insights</a>, an analytics tool that shows a business how employees and customers use its SaaS apps and office space, <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/products-and-solutions/vulnerability-management\" rel=\"nofollow\">Unified Vulnerability Management</a> (UVM), a cloud-native risk‑based vulnerability management system that shows the CISO which security vulnerabilities actually matter and how to fix them, <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/products-and-solutions/zscaler-itdr\" rel=\"nofollow\">Identity Threat Detection</a>, which shows the company when attackers are trying to misuse, steal, or abuse a company’s accounts and credentials, and <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/products-and-solutions/caasm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management</a> (CAASM), which gives management creates a clean, authoritative inventory of all the company's assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zscaler also includes Red Canary under Agentic Operations. Zscaler closed <a href=\"https://www.zscaler.com/press/zscaler-completes-acquisition-red-canary-accelerate-innovations-agentic-ai-driven-security\" rel=\"nofollow\">its $675 million acquisition</a> of Red Canary, a Managed Detection and Response (MDR) provider, on August 1, 2025. MDR is a service that combines advanced security tools with human threat hunters to prevent data breaches. Red Canary has gotten off to an excellent start. Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\") Kevin Rubin said at the Barclays 23rd Annual Global Technology Conference: </p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>So as we had mentioned going into the quarter, we expected Red Canary to contribute $83 million of ARR at the close. So that was the amount of underlying business that we picked up. And then we had shared that we expected Red Canary to deliver $95 million throughout fiscal '26, which effectively implies, if you just straight line it, $3 million a quarter. And our commentary was that they actually did a little better than that in Q1.

Several customers, including a Fortune 150 transportation company and a Fortune 100 service provider have already deployed AI Red teaming.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Be careful not to get confused when management discusses AI, as it is easy to mistake whether they are referring to the overall AI Security segment or to the subsegments: Security for AI apps and Agentic Operations. When investors parse through earnings calls for information about its AI initiatives, make sure to clearly understand what management is referring to. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For instance, Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") Jay Chaudhry forecasted that Agentic Operations would reach $400 million in ARR by the end of FY 2026 during the fourth-quarter FY 2025<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4818709-zscaler-inc-zs-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\"> earnings call</a>.

Management's initial revenue guidance for FY 2026 was $3.676 billion to $3.698 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 21.9% to 22.7%. The company raised its annual revenue guidance for FY 2026 in the first quarter to $3.282 billion to $3.301 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 22.8% to 23.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the company reported strong non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) earnings per share (\"EPS\") of $0.96, beating analysts' estimates of between $0.85 and $0.86, management reported a GAAP net loss of $11.6 million. Some investors are becoming increasingly fed up with the gap between non-GAAP and GAAP numbers, likely driven by high stock-based compensation (\"SBC\"). The company's SBC as a percentage of total revenue was 24.58% at the end of the first quarter, very high compared to other tech companies. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ZScaler also reported non-GAAP gross margins of 79.91%, a 66 basis points (\"bps\") year over year decline from 80.57%. CFO Rubin gave the following reasoning for the gross margin dip: </p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>I'd like to remind investors that we are introducing new products that are experiencing strong growth and are optimized for faster go-to-market rather than margins. This will continue to influence our gross margins on a quarterly basis. We plan to optimize new products for margins over time as they scale.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although this is a valid reason, growth investors may lower their valuation of a stock if gross margins decline. Investors also disliked this commentary from the CFO: \"With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we will invest aggressively to position us for long-term growth and profitability.\" Investors are concerned that \"investing aggressively\" may slow operating margin expansion, thereby delaying the time to GAAP profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the increased FY 2026 revenue guidance, analysts' FY 2026 revenue estimates of $3.28 billion to $3.30 billion were seen as in line with expectations, and, at Zscaler's valuation on November 25, the market wanted to see expectations blown away to continue awarding it a premium valuation. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-17717698495145228_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1014\" data-height=\"585\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-17717698495145228_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The image shows Zscaler increased its FY 2026 guidance.\" width=\"640\" height=\"369\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"369\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-17717698495145228_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-17717698495145228_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-17717698495145228_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/22/47657052-17717698495145228_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>First Quarter FY 2026 Earnings Presentation.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, the stock dropped 13% the day after the company released its first-quarter FY 2026 results.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What to look for moving forward</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the most important numbers to monitor the health of a SaaS company is ARR, as it measures renewal strength, forward revenue visibility, underlying demand, upsell/cross‑sell momentum, and the durability of the business model. Since a difference as small as 5% in growth rates can markedly change compounding over three to five years, investors should watch Zscaler's ARR to see if it can re-accelerate growth above 25%. The market will generally award a premium SaaS multiple (15–20× forward revenue) to a stock with a 25% ARR growth rate, a mid‑tier SaaS forward multiple (10–14×) to a stock with a 20–25% ARR growth rate, and a legacy SaaS multiple (6–9×) to a stock with less than a 20% ARR growth rate. Since Zscaler currently trades at a 7.728 multiple, the market may be pricing in that Zscaler's ARR growth will settle in the lower end of a 20% to 25% range and that it will be unable to reaccelerate ARR above 25%. Some investors may believe the company currently sits at fair value.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_ff39d42272b0249707dc609ab5f348dd.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_ff39d42272b0249707dc609ab5f348dd.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_ff39d42272b0249707dc609ab5f348dd.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_ff39d42272b0249707dc609ab5f348dd.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the market could still re-rate the valuation upwards if Zscaler maintains over 20% ARR growth over multiple years; AI Security sustains over 80% growth, or AI Security ARR exceeds $0.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2026.

RPO is a future-oriented measure that represents the total value of contracted revenue yet to be recognized. The market interprets RPO growing faster than revenue as the sales pipeline strengthening (revenue visibility improving), the sales team executing larger or longer deals, or potential revenue acceleration. The market may price in a higher revenue multiple if Zscaler can maintain RPO growth in the 30–35% range or higher, revenue growth in the mid‑20s, and ARR growth in the low‑20s or higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A word of caution, RPO doesn't perfectly predict future revenue acceleration as the mix of contract duration, billing terms, deal size, and seasonality can sway the number either positively or negatively. So, only use RPO as one piece of the puzzle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last area you should closely monitor is the company's rule of 78, an offshoot of 40, a metric invented in 2015 by venture capitalists Brad Feld and Fred Wilson to assess whether a SaaS company's growth is sustainable. The rule states that a SaaS company's revenue growth rate plus its profit margin should be at least 40%. The earliest version of the equation didn't explicitly specify which profit margin to use. However, <a href=\"https://feld.com/archives/2015/02/rule-40-healthy-saas-company/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brad Feld</a> did post in a blog the following comment:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Profit is harder to define. Are we talking about EBITDA [Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization], Operating Income, Net Income, Free Cash Flow, Cash Flow or something else. I prefer to use EBITDA here as the baseline and then back test with the other percentages.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One reason he stated it that way is that different profit margins can produce different results. For instance, the company uses its first-quarter FY 2026 FCF margin of 52% and its 26% revenue growth to calculate what it calls the Rule of 78, which would be one of the best in the industry. However, if you use the company's non-GAAP operating margin of 22%, the equation would produce a Rule of 48, and if you use its GAAP operating margin of -4.6%, it would equal 21.4, which would be an indication that growth was unsustainable long term, which is a big reason that investors are concerned about the company's GAAP profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The weakness of using the FCF margin is that it is a volatile figure that can swing due to billing cycles, big changes in working capital, and heavy growth investment and Capital Expenditure cycles; it doesn't directly measure a company's profitability. So, caution is warranted when looking at Zscaler's Rule of 78, and you should never compare Zscaler's stated Rule of 78 to a competitor's Rule of 40 measure using different profitability numbers, such as EBITDA margin or Operating margin, because that's like comparing Apples, Oranges, and Pears. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With all of those caveats in mind, as long as Zscaler sustains a FCF margin near 50% while growing revenue above 25%, the market may be more willing to award it a premium valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the end of the first quarter, its cash and short-term investments were 3.321 billion. The company's convertible senior debt was $1.699 billion, and its operating lease was $0.066 billion, for a total long-term debt of $1.765 billion.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_f366f0e4fd9dfc41ecf05e930d981a8f.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_f366f0e4fd9dfc41ecf05e930d981a8f.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_f366f0e4fd9dfc41ecf05e930d981a8f.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_f366f0e4fd9dfc41ecf05e930d981a8f.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zscaler's debt-to-equity ratio was 0.925, indicating that the company finances its operations primarily with equity rather than debt. Since a current ratio between 1.0 and 2.0 is the sweet spot for recurring‑revenue SaaS businesses, the company's 1.745 current ratio indicates it is well positioned to cover its near‑term liabilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I usually calculate a company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio. However, depending on how an analyst calculates ZScaler's EBITDA, it is close to the borderline between slightly negative and slightly positive. For instance, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZS/income-statement\">Seeking Alpha reports</a> ZScaler's TTM EBITDA as -67.7 million. Different third-party websites report its EBITDA as high as $183 million. The company's EBITDA is so close to the profitability threshold that the net-debt-to-EBITDA calculation is not very useful. However, some investors may be concerned about Zscaler's EBITDA being negative or barely profitable. Others believe that the company's prodigious FCF and cash exceeding long-term debt mean it will have little issue repaying the debt. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The major issue is that its long-term debt is convertible, which can dilute existing investors in addition to the substantial SBC.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zscaler's trailing 12-month (\"TTM\") price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is 8.791, below its three-, five-, and seven-year median. If the company can reaccelerate ARR to 25% or higher, it may return to at least its three-year median. At its three-year median, its price would be $249.50, a 56% rise above its February 20 closing price of 159.75.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_34d4046ab91ca96edbc71feefcfd18e9.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_34d4046ab91ca96edbc71feefcfd18e9.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_34d4046ab91ca96edbc71feefcfd18e9.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_34d4046ab91ca96edbc71feefcfd18e9.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The following compares Zscaler's forward P/S, P/S/G, TTM FCF margin, gross margin, operating margin, and return on invested capital (\"ROIC\") to its cybersecurity peer group.

However, its P/S/G is 0.33, well below the peer median of 0.63. Some investors may have concerns relating to the company's long‑term margin expansion, as reflected in its P/S/G trading meaningfully below its peers'. However, bullish investors may interpret the P/S/G trading below its median as a sign of undervaluation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's TTM FCF margin of 32.6% is only slightly above the peer group's median of 32.35%. Be aware that the Rule of 78 calculation uses quarterly FCF margin, while this comparison uses TTM FCF margin, which smooths out the cyclicality of the company's FCF, which fluctuates wildly quarter to quarter. Its TTM gross margin of 76.7% is above the peer group's TTM gross margin of 75.9%. Zscaler's TTM operating margin of -4.7% is below the peer group's median of 6.55%, and its TTM ROIC of -13.4% is below the peer group's median of -0.85%, raising investor concerns about Zscaler's operating efficiency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taking all these factors together, the company may be fairly valued, with potential upside if it maintains ARR growth in the low 20s over the next two years, revenue growth of 20% over the next two years, maintains TTM FCF margins in the low 30s or above, and achieves GAAP operating profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zscaler's TTM non-GAAP price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 49.61 is well above the Information Technology (\"IT\") median of 22.69, suggesting potential overvaluation or that the market has priced in earnings-per-share (\"EPS\") acceleration. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's FY 2026 forward P/E-to-estimated-EPS growth (\"PEG\") ratio is 2.26, calculated by dividing its 2026 forward P/E by its estimated EPS growth rate of 16.55%. Typically, growth investors consider high-margin mid-tier SaaS companies like Zscaler to be overvalued when their PEG ratio exceeds 2.0. As a result, at the current PEG ratio, the company may have no upside. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-1771917354131832_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1475\" data-height=\"309\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-1771917354131832_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The image shows Zscaler's forward P/E and analysts' estimated EPS growth.\" width=\"640\" height=\"134\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"134\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-1771917354131832_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-1771917354131832_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-1771917354131832_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-1771917354131832_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the bull case for Zscaler is ARR rising to 25%, Zscaler's AI programs becoming recognized as a winning solution, and its GAAP operating margin turning positive. Investors may then assign it a valuation well above 2.0, and it could have substantial upside. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't expect the stock's forward P/E to return to near 100, as it did in July 2025. Still, I think that it could return to 68.73, about halfway back to 100, which is realistic for a high-growth, market-leading cybersecurity stock in the current AI-driven environment. For instance, CrowdStrike's current forward P/E is 72.35, and Cloudflare's is 142.36. Note that although CrowdStrike and Cloudflare have different business models and margin structures, the market frequently values them together as AI‑beneficiary cybersecurity/cloud platforms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At a forward P/E of 68.37, Zscaler's stock price would be $262.60, a 84% rise over its February 23 closing price of <span>$143.28.</span> </p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_630ad606e3289f60331cc2bb88f85dfa.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_630ad606e3289f60331cc2bb88f85dfa.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_630ad606e3289f60331cc2bb88f85dfa.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_630ad606e3289f60331cc2bb88f85dfa.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zscaler has a TTM price-to-FCF (P/FCF) ratio well below its three-, five-, and seven-year medians.

If Zscaler's FCF margins remain relatively high, while GAAP operating margin expansion stalls, the market may eventually refuse to value it on a P/S or P/FCF and demand to see real GAAP earnings. The market may also punish the stock on even the slightest decline in revenue growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since running AI workloads may require significant spending on computing power and data, the market is concerned that Zscaler's costs for AI inference compute, memory storage, and large-scale data administration will increase as it ramps up numerous AI products, potentially adversely affecting margins. Robert W. Baird analyst Shrenik Kothari asked the following question on the first-quarter earnings call: \"As you're scaling these kind of video-rich products, the AI Guard, and how to think about the margins here?\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"Video-rich products\" refers to the fact that Zscaler's products, like ZDX's Digital Experience Monitoring, analyze all data passing through it to stop potential cybersecurity threats. Since Zscaler monitors video traffic through apps like Zoom or Teams, there is concern that processing bandwidth-intensive video streams could cost Zscaler a lot of money, hurting its profit margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CEO Chaudry tries to alleviate those concerns with the following answer:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Since the models and things they're using are really on a fairly well confined set of data, we haven't seen any massive change in gross margins. If these things change over time, I'm sure we'll let you guys know.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note that he never said AI model costs would never become an issue; he just said it wasn't an issue right now. CFO Rubin added:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>And maybe just to continue on that thread. Look, for Q1, we're pleased with the margin profile. We're comfortable with the Q2 guide. And then as we look into the back half of the year, you will notice that there's margin expansion in the guide in the back half. We are orientated to growth, but you know that we're also very mindful of the financial model and operating margin.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors should closely monitor margins for signs of deterioration from its expansion of AI initiatives. If you begin to see gross margin compression, the AI-powered growth thesis for buying this stock may break down. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another concern for investors is the macroeconomic environment. Gartner recently published <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2026-02-11-gartner-survey-finds-low-growth-econ-enviro-remained-top-concern-among-risk-leaders-in-q425\" rel=\"nofollow\">an article</a> that stated: \"[A] survey of 367 senior risk and assurance executives – taken in the final quarter of 2025 – revealed that the low-growth economic environment, which relates to financial instability, trade concerns, high unemployment and inflation, continued to concern risk leaders...\" A weak economic environment can prompt enterprise customers to slash their IT budgets, potentially hurting Zscaler if organizations delay or cancel spending on its products. CEO Chaudry spoke on the macroenvironment on the company's first-quarter earnings call:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Broadly speaking, there's no significant growth in macro environment. IT budgets remain tight. There is pressure on CIOs [Chief Information Officers]. There is far less pressure on the cyber side of it. So cyber is under less pressure. We do see scrutiny for large deals similar to what we shared in the past. But two areas are still of high interest to customers. One is Zero Trust Security because of all these breaches happening out there and second is AI security because everyone is trying to do some level of deployments of AI applications because CIOs feel like if they aren't doing anything in this area, they'll be viewed as laggards.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, although the economic environment is a headwind, at this point, it's not enough to bust the investing thesis for Zscaler, because the one area in IT that enterprises are spending money on is cybersecurity, specifically Zero Trust Security and AI security. Investors should monitor earnings calls for management's language on delayed deals causing revenue misses, which would be a symptom of macroeconomic factors affecting Zscaler.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last significant Zscaler risk that I will cover in this article is Red Canary integration. Although Red Canary is a key piece of Zscaler's \"AI-powered SOC (Security Operations Center)\" strategy to fight AI threats with AI security agents, analysts are concerned about Red Canary churn. On the first quarter earnings call, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall asked the following question: </p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Maybe I just wanted to ask a question about Red Canary and just how it's kind of performing towards expectations given that you guys have been looking at a fair amount of churn within your kind of assumptions for that business. Just any context around that performance would be helpful.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meta wants to know whether the churn management expected actually materialized. Investors are concerned that Zscaler's guide to \"a fair amount of churn\" in Red Canary’s ARR base raises legitimate questions about the stability of its customer base, the quality and length of its existing contracts, and whether Zscaler would need to rebuild the book of business from scratch to offset the churn. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, analysts and investors are concerned that the acquisition will adversely impact margins and ARR, as Red Canary carries several integration risks, including sales-team integration, product-and-engineering-team integration, and the risk that it distracts management from its core Zero Trust business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CEO Chaudry responded:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The integration of Red Canary with Zscaler is going very well. G&amp;A integration was done right away. The two other main areas were: one, engineering end products. We're integrating Red Canary's agentic AI technology with Zscaler platform doing well. Second is go-to-market. Red Canary's go-to-market team has become security operations specialist team. It's working with our field sales organization, which is uncovering opportunity. So seeing a vast majority of Zscaler Red Canary pipeline is now coming from Zscaler customers.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CFO Rubin added:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Yes. Look, I would just add that Red Canary is trending slightly better than our previous guidance. But keep in mind that we don't believe that Red Canary's contribution is material to our overall business. So as we go forward, we don't intend to provide specific color on Red Canary.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management answered Meta's question directly and addressed some of the other risks that investors are concerned about. Since Red Canary’s ARR contribution is small relative to Zscaler’s total ARR, its incorporation risk, while real, doesn't break the buy thesis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zscaler is still a buy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's negative GAAP profitability and lack of meaningful EBITDA make the stock ill-suited for value investors. However, growth‑oriented investors focused on ARR, FCF, and operating leverage may still be interested in Zscaler's potential upside. Since Zscaler has strong FCF margins, growth investors may view it as attractive and not purely speculative despite negative GAAP earnings.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-177194245785809_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1139\" data-height=\"636\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-177194245785809_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The image shows Zscaler's Serviceable Addressable Market.\" width=\"640\" height=\"357\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"357\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-177194245785809_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-177194245785809_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-177194245785809_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657052-177194245785809_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>November 2025 Corporate IR Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zscaler's TTM revenue of $2.83 billion is 2.7% of its Serviceable addressable market (\"SAM\") of $104 billion.

Information technology stocks led the benchmark<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> 1000 Value Index in the fourth quarter, followed closely by communication services and health care, which saw positive performance thanks to lower policy uncertainty, improved earnings, attractive valuations and a pickup in M&amp;A (mergers and acquisitions) activity. Despite a 25-basis-point cut in the federal funds rate in December, elevated long-term yields weighed on two sectors: real estate and utilities—the latter also suffering as the artificial intelligence trade pulled back.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Contributors: </strong>Holdings in Micron Technology (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU\" title=\"Micron Technology, Inc.\">MU</a>), Freeport-McMoRan (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCX\" title=\"Freeport-McMoRan Inc.\">FCX</a>) and OneMain (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OMF\" title=\"OneMain Holdings, Inc.\">OMF</a>). Stock selection in materials, IT and an overweight to health care.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Detractors: </strong>Holdings in Corcept Therapeutics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CORT\" title=\"Corcept Therapeutics Incorporated\">CORT</a>), Fiserv (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FISV\" title=\"Fiserv, Inc.\">FISV</a>) and Charter Communications (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CHTR\" title=\"Charter Communications, Inc.\">CHTR</a>). Stock selection in the health care, financials and communication services sector and an underweight to the IT sector.</li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Outlook: </strong>With value spreads near historic extremes and AI adoption poised to broaden economic benefits, we see an attractive probability gap that creates meaningful upside potential for valuation-driven investors.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance Review</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The Portfolios mildly underperformed their benchmark in a quarter that broadly favored value over growth, as declines in health care overcame strength from technology and materials stocks.</li> <li>Stock selection in the health care sector was the greatest detractor from relative returns in the fourth quarter, largely owing to the decline in drug developer Corcept Therapeutics, whose stock fell following the release of a FDA Response Letter for its relacorilant program, citing the need for additional evidence to support approval. With the prospect of the company having to lean more heavily on its legacy products, which are under pressure from greater generic competition, we elected to exit the position.</li> <li>Our top performer was Micron Technology, which continued to extend its strong 2025 performance following attractive earnings results and upbeat guidance due to accelerating AI-driven demand, tightening memory supply and improving pricing dynamics across DRAM and high-bandwidth memory markets. Performance was also bolstered by copper miner Freeport McMoRan, whose shares advanced alongside the commodity price on improving global growth expectations, a weaker U.S. dollar and continued optimism around long-term demand tied to electrification and energy transition trends.</li> <li>Newmont (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEM\" title=\"Newmont Corporation\">NEM</a>), in the materials sector, engages in the production and exploration of gold properties, as well as the exploration for copper, silver, zinc, lead, and other metals. The company's share price moved higher alongside gold prices during the quarter. Additionally, we believe that the market is beginning to recognize discount in the company's share price given the current price of gold and attractive free cash flow generation.</li> <li>Fiserv, in the information technology sector, provides payment and financial services technology. The company's stock declined after reporting disappointing third quarter results, missing earnings expectations, cutting full-year guidance and announcing a leadership shake-up, which raised investor concerns about growth and execution.</li> <li>Charter Communications, in the communication services sector, operates as a broadband connectivity and cable operator company serving residential and commercial customers. The company's stock declined after reporting weak third quarter results with subscriber losses, missing earnings expectations and announcing workforce reductions, which heightened investor concerns about growth and rising costs.</li> <li>In the fourth quarter, we made several changes within our financials holdings. For example, we swapped our exposure within regional banks by replacing M&amp;T Bank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTB\" title=\"M&amp;T Bank Corporation\">MTB</a>) with Fifth Third Bancorp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FITB\" title=\"Fifth Third Bancorp\">FITB</a>). We believe that Fifth Third is poised to accelerate its growth by combining its best-in-class digital strengths with recently acquired AmeriCorps's middle-market franchise in fast-growing, attractive regions in the Southeast, Texas and California, ultimately upgrading our overall return profile.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>At a broad level we underestimated the resilience of the market and the economy to the year's two big volatility events: the reveal of Chinese AI model DeepSeek and President Trump's Liberation Day. Both caused volatility to spike and relative performance pain despite ultimately proving incredibly short lived. The commonality in both is that we underestimated the structural resilience of the U.S. economy and the operating leverage that continues to support best-in-the-world free cash flow (FCF) margins for U.S. companies.</li> <li>On a broad level, the market continues to price value stocks relative to growth at a level that implies value has little chance of leading. Despite a couple of good years, value spreads have remained trapped at the cheapest 10% of their history. We think the catalyst for value's escape will, ironically, come from AI adoption. 2026 will be the year that AI has to justify the immense and accelerating capital investment. To do this, it will need to be diffused more broadly across the economy, driving material productivity gains and higher profit margins. If this occurs, it could narrow the margin, return and earnings growth gap between tech stocks and AI adopters, including value stocks not priced for this structural upside.</li> <li>Ultimately, we believe that the crucible of 2025 has helped sharpen our positioning for 2026. We are actively focused on finding AI adoption in sectors and industries where it is not currently priced, giving us exposure to the upside scenarios as we compound higher growth in a value wrapper. For the downsides, we are focused on companies generating free cash flow and with strong balance sheets. We have also continued to decrease individual stock volatility where we cannot reduce it as part of our portfolio construction. Finally, we are overweight real asset sectors such as energy and materials, which should do well in an inflation scenario while also compounding business value from robust ongoing free cash flow generation.</li> </ul> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li>Our main goal is to get back to making active valuation-disciplined investing look simple again, even if it isn't easy. While we approach every new year with humility and a focus on process discipline, we think positioning for many possible futures is critical in a market priced for a narrow set of outcomes — especially when the alternatives have much higher probabilities than what the market has priced. In an increasingly passive world crowded into the same few stocks and sectors, we think that this is a key source of differentiated returns for active, probability-driven managers like us.</li></ul> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <h4></h4> <h4>Top Equity Issuers (% of Total)</h4> <div class=\"table-responsive\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th>Holding</th> <th>Portfolio</th> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>Alphabet Inc</td> <td>4.42</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Bank of America Corp</td> <td>3.76</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd</td> <td>3.69</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Johnson &amp; Johnson</td> <td>2.95</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <a href=\"https://amazon.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon.com</a> Inc</td> <td>2.54</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Micron Technology Inc</td> <td>2.47</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Chevron Corp</td> <td>2.22</td> </tr> <tr> <td>EQT Corp</td> <td>2.21</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Walt Disney Co/The</td> <td>2.18</td> </tr> <tr> <td>CVS Health Corp</td> <td>2.04</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h2><span>Average annual total returns (%) - as of December 31, 2025-Preliminary</span></h2> <div class=\"table-responsive\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th>Composite</th> <th>3-Mo*</th> <th>6-Mo*</th> <th>YTD*</th> <th>1-Yr</th> <th>3-Yr</th> <th>5-Yr</th> <th>10-Yr</th> <th>15-Yr</th> <th>20-Yr</th> <th>25-Yr</th> <th>Inception</th> <th>Inception Date</th> </tr></thead> <tr> <td>Net of Fees</td> <td>2.87</td> <td>6.41</td> <td>8.85</td> <td>8.85</td> <td>11.28</td> <td>8.95</td> <td>7.07</td> <td>6.32</td> <td>4.91</td> <td>3.82</td> <td>6.50</td> <td>12/31/1993</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Pure Gross of Fees</td> <td>3.62</td> <td>7.98</td> <td>12.10</td> <td>12.10</td> <td>14.59</td> <td>12.20</td> <td>10.27</td> <td>9.49</td> <td>8.05</td> <td>6.94</td> <td>9.68</td> <td>12/31/1993</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Benchmark</td> <td>3.81</td> <td>9.34</td> <td>15.91</td> <td>15.91</td> <td>13.90</td> <td>11.33</td> <td>10.53</td> <td>10.78</td> <td>8.32</td> <td>7.71</td> <td>9.63</td> <td>—</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p>*Cumulative total returns</p> <h4>Benchmark(s)</h4> <p>Benchmark = Russell 1000 Value Index</p> <p><strong>The strategy returns shown are preliminary composite returns, subject to future revision (downward or upward).</strong></p> <p><strong>Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

This led me to mark a Buy rating on IMPP stock. With a stock price of $4.3 and an<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> mCap of ~$177 million and a zero-debt balance sheet backed by $172 million in absolute cash base, the enterprise value [EV] is virtually minimal. The strategic locking of 75% of fleet days into time charters backs stable cash flow and insulates Imperial Petroleum against spot market volatility and organic cash funds for an expansion to 26 vessels. The rationale behind my Buy rating is the floor formed by the $9.21 fully diluted Net Asset Value [NAV] and the $6.3 institutional capital raise. However, there are speculative elements. The main risk involves Imperial Petroleum's pattern for value-destructive equity dilution and the looming operational downtime from 12 scheduled vessel drydockings in 2026 that will temporarily suppress Imperial Petroleum’s earnings.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Uncoupling IMPP’s EV From Its Unencumbered Liquidity Fortress And Counter-Cyclical Cash Flow</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The major long-term positive (catalyst) for Imperial Petroleum’s stock price-upside is the absolute uncoupling of its EV from its liquidity stronghold and counter-cyclical cash flow. To expand more here, Imperial Petroleum is shifting from a highly volatile pure-play spot tanker operator into a diversified maritime infrastructure asset. To answer how? There is a fleet operational utilization rate of 88.7% and a strategic development that locked 75% of Imperial Petroleum’s calendar days into predictable time charter contracts. This development insulates Imperial Petroleum from freight rate volatility and, at the same time, drives massive predictable cash flows (<a href=\"https://www.imperialpetro.com/index.php/investor-relations/press-releases/137-imperial-petroleum-inc-reports-third-quarter-and-nine-months-2025-financial-and-operating-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">$57 million in operating cash flow</a> derived in YTD-FY2025 (9M). However, the main upside catalyst is in Imperial Petroleum stock’s current valuation against its zero-debt capital structure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-1772009483886477_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1099\" data-height=\"621\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-1772009483886477_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"75% of Imperial Petroleum‘s calendar days into predictable time charter contracts\" width=\"640\" height=\"362\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"362\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-1772009483886477_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-1772009483886477_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-1772009483886477_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-1772009483886477_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Imperial Petroleum IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a current stock price of $4.3, yielding an mCap of ~$177 million, the EV is practically minimized by Imperial Petroleum's stated <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4852559-imperial-petroleum-inc-impp-q3-2025-earnings-call-prepared-remarks-transcript\">cash base of $172 million</a>. A long position in IMPP stock is like acquiring an expanding fleet of 19 vessels (soon to be 26 vessels, totaling 1.5 million deadweight tons) for minimal enterprise premium. This large liquidity pool acts as a counter-cyclical instrument in the capital-intensive maritime market. Instead of suffocating under high-interest-rate burdens and restrictive debt covenants, Imperial Petroleum’s balance sheet allows it to organically self-fund all forward growth. The scheduled delivery of an additional 5 handysize drybulk carriers, a post-Panamax drybulk carrier, and a massive 319,400 dwt product tanker will be capitalized through existing cash and internal cash flow. This factor is bypassing the prohibitive costs of maritime debt markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, this absolute removal of interest expense guarantees that every incremental dollar of EBITDA (that increased 46.7% Y/Y to $17.9 million in Q3-FY2025) drops directly to the bottom line.

Moreover, the $60 million registered direct equity offering priced at <a href=\"https://www.imperialpetro.com/index.php/investor-relations/press-releases/137-imperial-petroleum-inc-reports-third-quarter-and-nine-months-2025-financial-and-operating-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">$6.3 in December 2025 </a>forms a strong institutional cost basis that is higher than the current traded price. Once Wall Street prices in the fact that the $52 million CapEx for 2026 acquisitions can be easily absorbed without impacting the liquidity moat, the extreme dislocation between the $4.3 share price and the management-estimated fully diluted NAV of $9.21 per share can quickly correct upwards, in my opinion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To clarify more on this, my point is that through maintaining a strong balance sheet, Imperial Petroleum may have stripped away the traditional bankruptcy and refinancing risks (that plague shipping equities, in general). This strong architecture/financial state means that even in a recession where spot rates collapse, Imperial Petroleum’s locked-in time charter revenues and vast cash reserves can theoretically stabilize operations. All this backs a possible long-term upward re-rating of IMPP stock as the deep-value advantage simply becomes too obvious for institutional capital/smart money to ignore.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk Of Chronic Equity Dilution With A Highly Concentrated Operational Bottleneck</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the long term, I am not ignoring the overarching risk of chronic equity dilution along with a highly concentrated operational bottleneck in FY2026. Despite holding a zero-debt balance sheet and driving a strong operating cash flow YTD, Imperial Petroleum did a highly questionable $60 million registered direct equity offering in December 2025. Raising equity at $6.3 per share amid holding over $100 million in cash and a fully diluted NAV of $9.21 per share is a harsh signal (from my perspective) that management prioritizes fleet-building and raw asset accumulation over per-share value accretion. This capitalization risk forms a value trap. To clarify, on how? If Wall Street locks in a sentiment that any forward cash flow spikes will be utilized as a base for further dilutive equity raises instead of capital return (buybacks/dividends), IMPP stock can suffer from a multiple compression.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a forward-basis, this effect can keep the stock price permanently disconnected from Imperial Petroleum’s asset value. Compounding this governance discount is a brutal operational cliff. Imperial Petroleum has scheduled 12 of its vessels to undergo mandatory drydocking in 2026. This is a big disruption that is sidelining almost half of the expanded 26-vessel fleet. The direct CapEx required for these <a href=\"https://www.imperialpetro.com/images/IMPPQ325.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">drydockings is estimated at $14 million</a>. However, I am focusing on a far more destructive cost, which is the large opportunity cost of lost operational days. With a fleet that has an 88.7% operational utilization rate, removing 12 vessels from active service will eat up revenue and short-term operating income. When this loss of active charter days is happening with the $52 million in capital commitments needed to pay for the 3 Japanese-built drybulk vessels (scheduled for delivery between Q1-Q3-FY2026), Imperial Petroleum’s $172 million cash castle can be quickly drained out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720094558563485_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1085\" data-height=\"391\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720094558563485_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Imperial Petroleum 2026 Strategy\" width=\"640\" height=\"231\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"231\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720094558563485_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720094558563485_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720094558563485_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720094558563485_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Imperial Petroleum IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More so, if macro conditions deteriorate (like a reversal in Chinese iron ore demand and further OPEC+ production cuts that may be limiting Suezmax tanker demand), at the same time, when this operational downtime peaks, Imperial Petroleum can face a high cash burn cycle. The magnitude of this dual-risk case is big. All in all, Imperial Petroleum expands its physical footprint and erodes its outstanding share denominator that builds downward gravity on the stock price. Smart Money/Institutional investors observing this emergence of peak CapEx, halved operational fleet capacity, and an aggressive dilution may dump the stock irrespective of how theoretically cheap Imperial Petroleum’s EV appears.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Imperial Petroleum Stock Valuation (Marks 72% Upside) And Q4 Alpha Protocol</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Imperial Petroleum’s stock valuation needs an EV/EBITDA method focused on NAV and the enterprise liquidity base. As of now, Imperial Petroleum has a $172 million cash base with zero debt against an mCap of ~$177 million. This yields an EV of ~$5 million only for a fleet generating $49.6 million in EBITDA over YTD-FY2025 (9M). Imperial Petroleum’s pro forma fully diluted NAV is at $9.21 per share based on the assumption of all outstanding warrants after the December equity offering. To find a realistic target price, a governance and fleet age discount must be applied to Imperial Petroleum’s asset value. If I apply a current aggressive market discount [based on the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)] and use the forward 3.575x EV/EBITDA multiple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IMPP/valuation/metrics\">50% below the sector median</a>) on annualized 2025 EBITDA of $66 million, it yields an EV of ~$236 million. Adding the current $172 million cash base leads to an equity value of ~$408 million. Dividing this by an estimated 55.2 million (508.03 million net assets/$9.21 NAV per share) fully diluted shares gives a fair value of $7.4 per share. This target price holds a highly logical +72% upside from current levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Prior to the Q4 release, IMPP bulls can buy a baseline long-position. The current $4.3 stock price with post-Q3 swing prices-in the negativity of the December equity dilution and integrating the operating advantage (in my opinion). Q4 results will capture the full quarterly cash flow from the newly integrated 19-vessel fleet and the seasonal winter rate spikes in the product tanker market. These factors are backing a high probability for a strong earnings beat. After Q4, focus must shift to forward guidance. If Imperial Petroleum’s management provides a staggered timeline for the 12 scheduled FY2026 drydockings that protects baseline cash flow and confirms halting further stock dilution, bulls should aggressively scale long-side positions into the IMPP stock. On the negative, if earnings indicate unchecked CapEx and hints of further stock offerings, long-positions must be liquidated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720093894285793_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2000\" data-height=\"1281\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720093894285793_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Imperial Petroleum IMPP stock price recovery Post-Q3\" width=\"640\" height=\"410\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"410\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720093894285793_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720093894285793_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720093894285793_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59390483-17720093894285793_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>YCharts</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">___</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, with all that, Imperial Petroleum stock ticks a Buy rating due to an extreme, unignorable valuation disconnect. Imperial Petroleum, driving high FCF, holding $172 million in cash base with zero debt, and expanding to 26 vessels, cannot logically trade at an EV near zero. Moreso, the upside potential eclipses the downside risks at the $4.3 entry point. On a forward basis, I will be tracking the outstanding share count to check on absolute zero further dilution, the execution efficiency of the $52 million CapEx for the three pending drybulk acquisitions, and the scheduling of the 12 upcoming 2026 drydockings. Any deviation that signals deteriorating governance and unmanaged operational off-hire days may invalidate my bullish thesis.</p>",

The article was triggered by ABBV’s dividend<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> declaration made for Q1 2026 and rated the stock as a hold. As for </span><strong class=\"paywall-full-content\">Merck &amp; Co., Inc.</strong><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRK\" title=\"Merck &amp; Co., Inc.\">MRK</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), my last analysis dated further back to July 16, 2025. That article was triggered by the </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4446414-innovation-pharma-profits-wont-suffer-under-trump-prescription-drug-eo-white-house\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Executive Order</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> that President Trump announced to lower drug prices for American consumers at that time. It also rated MRK as a hold.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since then, there have been a few new catalysts evolving around both heath care stocks. The remainder sections of this article will focus on A) the updates they provided in their recent FQ4 2025 earnings reports (ER), and B) their latest dividend announcements. As to be elaborated, the latest financial changes in FQ4, when combined with their latest dividend declarations, have materially changed their dividend cushion ratio in our model. More specifically, my analysis shows the continued improvement in MRK’s cushion ratio in contrast continued weakening in ABBV’s. This divergence is substantial enough to lead to a rating upgrade for MRK to buy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me start with a quick recap of the FQ4 ER for both companies to prime the rest of the discussion. Both MRK and ABBV released their ER in early February (on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup>, respectively). Both companies post robust results, both beating consensus estimates as shown in the snapshots below. AbbVie continued its upward momentum with a double digit YOY growth rate of 10.04% on the topline. In contrast, Merck demonstrated another quarter of earnings recovery following a weak start in the year. After suffering a YOY decline in Q1 and Q2, MRK’s revenue turned around and grew 3.72% and 4.97% in Q3 and Q4, respectively. These results suggest to me that the macroeconomic headwinds (such as the effects of drug pricing mentioned in my earlier articles) facing the health care sector are dissipating, supporting an overall favorable outlook for both stocks in my view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029971493747_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1944\" data-height=\"300\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029971493747_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"99\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029971493747_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029971493747_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029971493747_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029971493747_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299721480277_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1941\" data-height=\"309\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299721480277_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"102\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299721480277_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299721480277_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299721480277_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299721480277_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">MRK and ABBV: Dividend cushion ratio in focus</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The updated earnings, when combined with their latest dividend declarations, have brought the payout ratios of both stocks closer as shown in the top panel of the next chart charts.

To start, they fluctuate quite a bit due to quarterly profit uncertainties, especially in terms of accounting EPS payout ratios as shown in the bottom panel in the chart above. More fundamentally, the also completely ignore other important factors such as the use of leverage and the status of the balance sheet. From years of experiences, an effective framework I found that can overcome these limitations is the dividend cushion ratio (“DCR”). Details of the DCR is provided in Brian M Nelson’s book entitled <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Value-Trap-Theory-Universal-Valuation/dp/0998038482\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Value Trap</em></a>. The key steps are quoted there to ease reference:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>The DCR is obtained by A) summing the existing net cash a company has on its balance sheet plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years, and B) dividing that sum by future expected cash dividends (including expected growth in them, where applicable) over the same time period. If the ratio is significantly above 1, the company generally has sufficient financial capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. The higher the ratio, the better, all else equal. </em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before presenting my results (shown in the next two charts for those who cannot wait), let me first point out a few modification I made to Nelson’s above framework. In step A quote above, his original framework subtracted the total debt to obtain the net cash position on the balance sheet. In my calculations, I only subtracted the current liabilities and the interest expenses on the consideration of MRK and ABBV’s profit consistency and credit ratings. With these considerations, I see virtually zero possibility in any foreseeable future for MRK or ABBV to have the need of repaying all their debts all at once. Thus, I feel appropriate to assess their cushion ratio based on the assumption that both MRK and ABBV only need to repay the current portion of their debts and service the interest payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bearing this modification in mind, let’s walk through the details of their DCRs now. The first observation that stands out is that both MRK and ABBV have been maintaining DCRs well above the 1x threshold. To wit, MRK’s DCR has been always above 2.0x since 2020 with a 6-year average of 2.29x as seen in the first chart. The same is true for ABBV’s DCR too as seen in the second chart, and its 6-year average reading is even better at 2.64x as shown.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715642717_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1026\" data-height=\"540\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715642717_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A yellow and red text on a white background AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"337\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715642717_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715642717_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715642717_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715642717_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029972459901_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1013\" data-height=\"531\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029972459901_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A yellow and red text on a white background AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"335\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029972459901_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029972459901_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029972459901_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029972459901_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">ABBV and MRK: CAPEX in focus</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 2<sup>nd</sup> observation that stands out is the divergence between MRK and ABBV’s cushion ratios. As seen, since 2021, MRK’s DRC has kept improving and my projected reading points to a further thickening to 2.57x in 2026, not only above its own historical average by a good margin but also exceeds my projected ratio for ABBV at 2.19x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Digging to the ER deeper, a key factor causing the divergence is their CAPEX plans. To wit, the next chart compares the Cash Flow (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CF\" title=\"CF Industries Holdings, Inc.\">CF</a>) to Capital Expenditure (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAPEX\" title=\"Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Growth Fund 1.0\">CAPEX</a>) ratio for ABBV and MRK in the past 5 years from 2021 to the present. This metric measures a company's ability to fund its physical asset investments using its operating cash flow, and a higher ratio is better with everything else being equal. As seen, AbbVie has significantly cranked up its CAPEX spendings in recent years. The company CF-CAPEX ratio was on average 25.59 in the past 5 years, which meant it spent on average about 3.9% (the inverse of 25.59) of its CF to fund its CAPEX in the past. The current reading is 15.86x per the FQ4 ER, which means it spent about 6.3% of its CF in the past quarter on CAPEX. Such a large increase in CF impacted its free cash flow, which in turn pressured its DCR. Judging by the guidance provided in its FQ4 ER, I expect ABBV’s CAPEX to remain alleviated in 2026 to support is various pipeline efforts. In contrast, MRK’s CF-CAPEX ratio has been on an upward trend in the past few quarters and sits above its long-term average as seen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029973771875_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1353\" data-height=\"423\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029973771875_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"200\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029973771875_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029973771875_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029973771875_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029973771875_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other risks and final thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, ABBV’s CF-CAPEX ratio of 15.86x is completely manageable and sustainable in my experience despite the substantial change relative to its historical norm. Furthermore, as shown in the chart above, ABBV’s current CF-CAPEX ratio of 15.86x is still about 2x higher than Merck’s ratio of 7.92x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of valuation, ABBV is trading at a larger P/E ratio discount relative to MRK. To wit, the following screenshot compares their FWD P/E ratios. Based on FY1 EPS projection, MRK’s P/E is 24.15x, a premium of more than 56% compared to ABBV's reading of only 15.73x. Although note that with MRK’s better growth projection, its P/E ratios would quickly approach ABBV’s in FY2 (12.6x vs. 14.2x) and become lower than ABBV’s ratio in FY3 (11.4x vs 12.9x). Finally, judging by their dividend yields, I believe the above FY1 P/E comparison overstates MRK’s P/E premium. As an example, MRK’s forward yield of 2.74% is about 8% below its 4-year average yield, while ABBV’s forward yield of 3.03% is about 15% below its own 4-year average yield (see the last chart). Such as contrast suggests that ABBV is actually trading at a higher valuation premium than MRK.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To close, this follow-up article on MRK and ABBV is largely promoted by 2 new developments since my last analyses: their latest FQ4 2025 ERs and their latest dividend declarations. A closer look at these developments suggests to me that the macroeconomic headwinds facing the sector are fading, which supports my overall positive view towards both ABBV and MRK. A look at their financials further shows their dividend safety with DCRs well above 1x. Although the divergence in their DCR, mostly due to their CAPEX plans, is substantial enough for me to upgrade MRK’s rating to buy.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715451105_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"913\" data-height=\"287\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715451105_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"201\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715451105_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715451105_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715451105_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-17720299715451105_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha data</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029978856417_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"943\" data-height=\"274\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029978856417_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"186\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029978856417_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029978856417_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029978856417_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48844541-1772029978856417_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p>",
