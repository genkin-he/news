At the time, revenue growth was strong, charge-offs were improving, and margins were also expanding. But valuations were not compelling enough to compensate<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> for the rising macro credit risks and uncertainties. I was concerned about the earnings durability in a potentially weakening consumer environment. I was also wary of a very competitive subprime lending segment and limited expansion potential. Since then, my wait for a better visibility of the credit cycle and a deeper valuation reset have both played out favorably to consider a Buy. All this while, operating strength remained intact.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Execution and Operating Strength</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interest and dividend income growth has strengthened from ~10% levels we were seeing in May last year. There is visible growth acceleration and further confirmation of a growth trend that had just emerged in Q1 2025. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834849-oppfi-inc-opfi-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q3 2025</a> also reported a ~41% YoY increase in adjusted net income. Guidance for revenue growth is solid (double digits) in Q4 and into 2026. Adjusted net income has also been guided significantly higher from $125-130m earlier to $137-$142m for the full year. That is a material revision for the full year with just a quarter left to report, although the YTD run rate was already pointing to ~$150m. This guidance upgrade could be interpreted as conservative expectation setting and upgraded with only better visibility and certainty – but even that better visibility and certainty counts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/62089123-17719004168890316_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"750\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/62089123-17719004168890316_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Interest and Dividend Income Growth YoY - OPFI\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/62089123-17719004168890316_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/62089123-17719004168890316_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/62089123-17719004168890316_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/62089123-17719004168890316_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Interest and Dividend Income Growth YoY - OPFI <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Conducive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since my May thesis, OppFi has corrected by ~24%, but valuations have contracted much more. With earnings revised upward, the forward P/E ratio, which was around 9x earlier, is now ~5x (far lower than the ~7x levels I had in mind to re-evaluate entries). At ~5x, markets are either discounting an earnings contraction phase ahead or are skeptical about earnings sustainability – OppFi's double-digit growth and repeated earnings guidance upgrades do not explain this sharp a multiple contraction. Even if earnings fall by ~30%, the P/E ratio expands to ~7-8x – levels I had found reasonable for a profitable specialty lender in 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_22d735ad133db81c969b5316e3569c5b.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_22d735ad133db81c969b5316e3569c5b.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_22d735ad133db81c969b5316e3569c5b.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_22d735ad133db81c969b5316e3569c5b.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPFI/valuation/metrics\">price-to-book ratio</a> is ~2.96x. This may look higher than traditional lenders who generally report valuations at around 1-2x the book value (median valuations ~1.2x). Specialty lending could be priced higher if the RoE and book value are expanding strongly. And in OppFi's case, both are visible. The book value dipped a bit before rising materially above the ~$30m mark seen in Q1 2025 (which was the basis of the May 2025 thesis). The RoE has also followed a similar expansion path and now sits at a very strong ~51% level. With ~$140m in projected earnings against $277m in equity, retained earnings should expand book value rapidly, compressing price-to-book valuations organically if profitability holds. Overall, at ~5x earnings and ~3x book with ~50% RoE, valuation now provides asymmetry – provided credit metrics remain within management’s targeted bands.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_ebcda6f4eb8f3e398403874270bbea4f.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_ebcda6f4eb8f3e398403874270bbea4f.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_ebcda6f4eb8f3e398403874270bbea4f.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_ebcda6f4eb8f3e398403874270bbea4f.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_627bcd08044de5fdc50e87f9645d1725.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_627bcd08044de5fdc50e87f9645d1725.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_627bcd08044de5fdc50e87f9645d1725.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_627bcd08044de5fdc50e87f9645d1725.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Credit - The Core Variable</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Credit becomes the core variable for OppFi as it scales. While the macro-related credit risks I was wary of in May last year have not emerged, the macro uncertainty has not improved significantly either. The odds of a recession <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/outlook/market-outlook\" rel=\"nofollow\">still loom</a>, and credit deterioration cannot yet be ruled out – unless growth stabilizes, labor markets strengthen, and we have better clarity on monetary policy. However, we have lived through a tariff regime and its uncertainties without collapsing, and the odds of a recession, although still high, are decreasing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Importantly, OppFi's credit quality is not showing any obvious signs of worsening. Net charge-offs are now 35% of revenue, only marginally higher than the 34% level seen last year. OppFi now has the capability to dynamically adjust pricing across risk bands, including adjustments at the weekly level. This means when losses rise, yields can adjust. Additionally, management has demonstrated a sustained strong recovery record for the past two years. Lower fixed costs also help cushion any rising loss scenario in a softer credit phase. OppFi's operating expenses fell to ~30% of revenue in Q3 2025, compared to 33% in the prior year. Interest expenses also fell to 6% of revenue (vs. 8% earlier).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The execution so far, overall, improves confidence in OppFi's ability to navigate a slightly deteriorating credit situation. And all is not well in terms of the credit environment – new vintages showing higher early payment defaults. Management has acknowledged a potentially worsening credit situation, but nothing that alters OppFi's ability to navigate it:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>I'm not going to not say that credit isn't worse. It is worse than it was last year in the new segments, especially the new, but something that we can operate in now with our current pricing structure and how we operate.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The numbers so far do not show material impact overall. These are not the best credit conditions, but the impact appears to be controlled – offset by recoveries and cushioned by lower funding costs. The provisions data charted below (as a % of revenue) also shows controlled loss intensity relative to earnings power. In the past few quarters, the provision ratio has also stabilized within the 32-38% band, despite modest credit softening in newer vintages. Overall, credit costs are elevated but within a controllable band.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62089123-17719178654924443_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"750\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62089123-17719178654924443_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Provision as a % of Revenue - OPFI\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62089123-17719178654924443_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62089123-17719178654924443_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62089123-17719178654924443_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62089123-17719178654924443_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Provision as a % of Revenue - OPFI <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">OppFi Is a Buy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I expect OppFi to continue its double-digit growth not only in the upcoming quarter but also in early 2026 as well. I think markets are cautious about OppFi now because of higher charge-offs in Q4, as indicated in the Q3 earnings call. I think that could be the case indeed (charge-offs drifting to the higher thirties), but that is not a structural issue or a reflection of macro worsening. Q4 may see higher charge-offs due to seasonal effects like seasoning and delinquency roll-forward mechanics and holiday spending stretching borrower liquidity. We have seen higher provisioning in Q4 2024 too. I would take the opportunity to Buy before the quarterly results, while the expectations are low (because there is no structural damage here yet).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My Buy call is comforted by valuations that are much more conducive and often absorbs bad news, especially if temporary. I have argued before how the valuations can absorb short-term earnings shocks at current levels and still look reasonable if the long-term thesis holds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q4, alongside an expected worse charge-off, I see adjusted net income coming out well over the guided $137-$142m range. This is because the current run rate, even with deep moderation (say 25%), shows an adjusted net income above the upper end of the full-year guidance (~$142.5m). That could compensate for any negative sentiment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The primary risk to the Buy thesis is if credit normalization does not stabilize as expected, although nothing negative is indicated yet. A sharper deterioration in borrower metrics, particularly if newer vintages show sustained weakness beyond seasonal patterns, could push charge-offs above manageable bands and pressure earnings despite pricing flexibility. Investors should also watch whether competitive intensity or regulatory developments limit OppFi’s ability to fully reprice risk. If loss trends accelerate, the earnings durability narrative would weaken, and the multiple may remain compressed longer than anticipated.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, the thesis rests on three pillars – accelerating operating momentum, materially improved valuation, and credit costs that remain controlled (even if it stays at current levels). I maintain a Buy as long as charge-offs and provisions stay within historically manageable ranges and earnings power remains intact. I would reassess this position if net charge-offs move sustainably above 40% of revenue without offsetting pricing power, or if guidance turns structurally lower due to credit stress rather than seasonality.</p>",

Part of this is because many major market indexes have been stuck in a trading range and seem to have hit stall speed for<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the past few months. I see so much uncertainty in various areas now, which I think is making it hard for the stock market to break out of its recent trading range. Like most investors, I see reasons to be both bullish and bearish.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, if the market is unable to resume climbing a \"wall of worry\" soon, I think the chances of a market plunge will become more likely. I think many market participants hoped that a strong earnings report from Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) would reignite the bull market, but the stock's post-earnings price action seems to be a potential warning sign for the market overall. This downbeat reaction seems to cap the results of the earnings season overall—despite strong earnings reports in general, the stock market has been unable to rally on this good news. With all this in mind, let's take a closer look at what could get the stock market back on track:</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Charts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the chart below shows, the S&amp;P 500 Index (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a></span>) has been stuck in a trading range for a few months now. While this index is still trading near record levels and near the 50-day moving average, I believe it risks a correction, as it appears to have run out of steam. If there is a drawdown, it might not be too bad, as it could find support near the 200-day moving average, indicated by the red trend line on the chart.

Many investors are rotating out of tech stocks due to fears about an AI bubble, overspending on capex, and AI disruption in software and other sectors, and this has helped to support this broader index. As shown in the chart below, the NASDAQ 100 Index (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NDX\" title=\"NASDAQ 100-Index\">NDX</a></span>) appears to have formed a bearish double top on the chart since hitting record highs in October and then roughly matching those levels in January before pulling back to current levels. The failure to decisively break out to new highs in January is a potential warning sign for the bulls.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311118424625_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"990\" data-height=\"817\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311118424625_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"528\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311118424625_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311118424625_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311118424625_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311118424625_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>StockCharts.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings Season Has Failed As An Upside Catalyst</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Many companies reported strong earnings overall, and earnings season is wrapping up now. The hyperscalers reported strong earnings results, but their stocks fell after they announced plans to increase capex spending. Nvidia was one of the last major tech stocks expected to report earnings. Nvidia reported very strong earnings, which was widely expected, but the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557921-nasdaq-drops-nearly-2-percent-as-the-tech-selloff-deepens-post-nvidias-earnings\">post-earnings price action</a> was negative, and that suggests that Nvidia can't carry the market higher for now. With earnings season largely over and the major market indexes still stuck in a trading range, the bulls will need to find new potential upside catalysts soon. If they don't, I believe the market is likely to resolve the position it has been stuck in by declining.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here Are Some Potential Upside Catalysts That Bulls Can Focus On</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Potential upside catalysts include lower interest rates as we move further into 2026 and potentially large tax refunds for many households. However, just as great earnings were expected and delivered by Nvidia, I think that investors may have already priced in the expectations for lower interest rates and larger tax refunds. This could mean these are non-events, just as Nvidia's strong earnings report was a non-event instead of a major upside catalyst for the bulls. So, it might take a combination of positives to get this bull market back on track, and it might also need more potential upside catalysts, which could include the following:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>1) AI Disruption Fears Could Ease:</strong> The software sector has been one of the hardest hit by fears of AI disruption, but many sectors have been impacted by these fears recently. It is starting to look like these fears are getting out of hand. One potential example is a former karaoke company that recently <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/pro/tens-of-billions-of-dollars-wiped-out-from-household-name-brands-as-obscure-penny-stock-karaoke-vendor-turned-ai-platform-debuts-game-changing-platform\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> it was changing its focus to AI and that it had a game-changing development in freight logistics using AI. When this announcement was made a few days ago, the market responded by wiping out over $17 billion in market cap in the freight sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think this is a clear sign that investors are potentially overreacting, so if investors realize that the worst fears over AI disruption might not be very likely, the tech sector, software in particular, could be poised for a rebound. A rebound in software-related stocks like Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) could be the upside catalyst that this market needs for the bulls to take back control. If you look at the chart of the software sector below, you can see that these stocks recently reached the same lows hit during the stock market plunge after Liberation Day tariffs were announced in April 2025. This suggests that this sector may have bottomed out and could be poised for a relief rally, which could benefit the stock market overall.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311483905313_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"990\" data-height=\"817\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311483905313_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"528\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311483905313_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311483905313_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311483905313_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311483905313_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>StockCharts.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>2) IPO Success:</strong> OpenAI and Anthropic are two of the most revered AI startups, and both plan to go public in 2026. If these companies and other high-profile tech companies have successful IPOs, it could alleviate concerns about funding and circular deals that have created fears of an AI bubble. OpenAI in particular seems controversial because its major commitments will require massive funding. However, if they raise more cash in an IPO with an estimated <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/openai-is-reportedly-planning-a-1-trillion-ipo/498994#:~:text=the%20company's%20focus.-,OpenAI%20is%20reportedly%20eyeing%20an%20initial%20public%20offering%20%28&lt;a%20href='https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IPO'%20title='Renaissance%20IPO%20ETF'&gt;IPO&lt;/a&gt;)%20that,at%20up%20to%20$1%20trillion\" rel=\"noopener\">$1 trillion market cap</a>, investors will probably take their spending commitments more seriously.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>3) Investors Could Rotate Back Into The Mag 7:</strong> One way to get this bull market back on track is if investors decide that the Mag 7 stocks are now undervalued after recent declines over capex spending plans. I think stocks like Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) and Microsoft are deeply undervalued after plunging due to the announcement of increased capital expenditures. A recent Bank of America (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAC\" title=\"Bank of America Corporation\">BAC</a>) investor <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/25/normally-staid-bond-investors-have-a-new-biggest-worry-an-ai-bubble.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">survey</a> suggests that an AI bubble is investors' biggest fear. However, many of the Mag 7 stocks are now trading far below market PE multiples.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By contrast, the recent rotation out of tech stocks and into consumer staples has pushed those valuations to levels that make no sense to me, unless this signals an approaching recession. This is especially true when considering the growth rates. For example, Walmart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>) now trades for about <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\">43 times </a>earnings, and earnings are expected to grow by around 10%. By contrast, Microsoft is now trading for just about half the multiple of Walmart, which is just around <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\">23 times </a>earnings, and it is expected to post higher growth rates for years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As this Seeking Alpha <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557783-from-ai-to-a1-sauce-staples-are-now-pricier-than-megacaps\">article</a> points out, consumer staple stocks are now more expensive than mega-cap tech stocks. If a bubble exists, it might be in consumer staple stocks, not the tech sector. Mega-cap tech stocks could regain favor soon because their valuations appear attractive, and this sector may have bottomed out. As shown below, the chart of the Roundhill Bug Tech ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAGS\" title=\"Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF\">MAGS</a>) recently touched the 200-day moving average, and it has rebounded slightly from that level. This could signal that these tech stocks are poised to rebound.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311812802134_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"990\" data-height=\"817\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311812802134_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"528\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311812802134_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311812802134_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311812802134_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/902464-17721311812802134_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>StockCharts.com</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>4) Geopolitical Tensions:</strong> There are several global hotspots, and tensions between the United States and Iran appear to be growing. If diplomacy succeeds, or if any potential military action in the Middle East is short-lived, the stock market could be poised for a relief rally. I plan to use any stock market weakness stemming from geopolitical tensions as a buying opportunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>5) Seasonal Trends: </strong>February is not <a href=\"https://tradethatswing.com/seasonal-patterns-of-the-stock-market/?srsltid=AfmBOor6fRsSMx7-XZb_SFbsZ7nDH5wSGj68Za_PH1qXGRhVNvWw0A3M\" rel=\"nofollow\">historically</a> known as a strong month for the stock market. By contrast, March and April are typically two of the best months for stocks. Perhaps this seasonal pattern will play out and get the bull market back on track with new potential highs in the coming weeks. During March and April, we might see the impact of bigger tax refunds, which could also support the bull case. Some analysts believe that many consumers might <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/02/18/stocks-150-billion-yolo-trade-tax-returns-wells-fargo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">invest their tax refunds into the stock </a>market, and this could be another upcoming positive.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Downside Risks Could Lead To A Bear Market</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stock market valuations are high and possibly priced for perfection. Margin debt is near <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/key-topics/margin-accounts/margin-statistics\" rel=\"nofollow\">record high levels</a>, which has often set the stage for a bear market. JPMorgan Chase (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM\" title=\"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.\">JPM</a>) CEO Jamie Dimon recently <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/24/economy/jamie-dimon-warning\" rel=\"nofollow\">warned</a> about private credit, AI euphoria, and potential loan losses in the financial sector. The job market has been showing weakness for the past few months, and AI-related job losses could be poised to increase as time goes by.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are just some of the many warning signs that could threaten the bull market and lead us into a bear market. When we see very strong earnings from Nvidia, yet the stock drops, it is a troubling sign and could be one more indicator that the bull market has topped out. If the stock market can't rally on good news (such as a strong earnings season), the path of least resistance could be lower. We could continue to see consolidation for a bit longer, where the market seemingly stagnates, but I believe the longer this drags out, the more likely it will resolve to the downside.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think there is still a good chance that investors will pile back into mega-cap tech stocks due to better valuations after a recent selloff. The valuations of stocks like Microsoft and Amazon look attractive when compared to historical valuations or to companies like Walmart. Fears about AI disruption may have become overblown, and if these fears ease, the software sector could rebound and help get the bull market back on track.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If AI startups like OpenAI and Anthropic have strong IPOs, this could renew investor interest in tech stocks and quell fears about an AI bubble. While there is still probably some time for the bulls to reassert control of this market, I think time is running out, especially since Nvidia's earnings results seem to have failed as an upside catalyst. I believe this is a higher-risk moment for the market, and as such, I am keeping high levels of cash in my portfolio so that I am prepared for market pullbacks. At the same time, I can't pass up opportunities to buy stocks like Amazon and Microsoft when their valuations are much lower today than they were just weeks ago.</p>",

At that time, I thought that perhaps the business might be worthy of an upgrade. This followed a plunge in the share price<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> of 15.3% at a time when the S&amp;P 500 was up 18.9%. At the end of the day, however, I decided against upgrading it. Revenue and profitability had slipped compared to what the company saw in 2024. And, I claimed, the business looked mostly fairly valued as opposed to undervalued. So instead of upgrading it, I reaffirmed it as a \"Hold\" candidate. For context, whenever I rate a company a \"Hold,\" I am making the claim that the stock should perform more or less similarly to the broader market for the foreseeable future. Since that day, we have seen that transpire. Shares are up 12.4%, only narrowly outperforming the 11.5% increase that the market enjoyed.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a purely fundamental standpoint, management has continued to capture revenue growth. But the bottom line for the business has been more complicated. While net profits and adjusted net profits have pulled back, cash flows are on the rise. The good news is that management is implementing additional cost-savings initiatives throughout 2026. As things stand, the company looks pretty much fairly valued on an absolute basis and might be a bit pricey relative to other firms that have similarities to it. Given this, I think that maintaining my \"Hold\" rating is the right choice here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s too early for an upgrade</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of this writing, investors have data for the company extending through the entirety of <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/8818/000000881826000004/ex9918k2-4x26.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/8818/000000881826000004/ex9918k2-4x26.htm\" target=\"_blank\">2025</a>. Obviously, this means the final quarter of the year as well. For that time, the business actually did quite well. Revenue came in at $2.27 billion, which exceeded the $2.19 billion the business reported a year earlier. Based on the data provided, this expansion was driven in large part by the company’s Materials Group, which operates as a provider of label materials, graphics, and reflective materials. It also provides certain functional bonding materials like tapes.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628687350867_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2108\" data-height=\"856\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628687350867_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"260\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"260\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628687350867_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628687350867_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628687350867_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628687350867_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Year over year, revenue for the business jumped 5.1%, from $1.47 billion to $1.55 billion. This is great to see in and of itself. However, the devil is in the details here. Most of the revenue increase was actually driven by foreign currency fluctuations. If we strip those out, we would get a rise of just 0.3%. And to make matters worse, actual organic growth was negative to the tune of 0.9%. There were certain areas of strength, most notably high-value categories like the Intelligent Labels offerings that jumped at a high single-digit rate. Graphics and reflectives were up at a low single-digit rate as well. But on the whole, while the company did see a rise in volume and favorable changes in product mix, lower prices that it had to pass on to consumers because of deflation ultimately pushed organic results lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also have the Solutions Group segment, which focuses on providing information and branding solutions to customers. Specific examples here include data management and digital identification associated with branding and embellishment, in addition to those same services for things like pricing and retail media and productivity. One thing that the company prides itself on is its emphasis on providing ultra-high-frequency RFID solutions that are vital for the modern-day supply chain. Everything from the food and grocery space to general retail, to the apparel market, to even aspects of the industrial economy, benefits from these types of solutions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue here was up only slightly, inching up 1.5% from $713.7 million to $724.2 million. The good news was that all of this was organic in nature, with management chalking that up to sales in the Intelligent Labels category popping at a low single-digit rate, Embelex-related revenue up at a high single-digit rate, and Vestcom growing in excess of 10%. While the Intelligent Labels portion of the company is more well-known, these other two are lesser known by market participants. For context, Embelex focuses on providing certain apparel and retail branding solutions, including woven and printed garment labels, heat transfers and embellishments, hashtags and trims, and the like. Meanwhile, Vestcom specializes in store shelf communication and pricing systems like shelf tags and price labels, promotional signage, digital shelf labeling integration technologies, and more. Overall, I would say that these value-added offerings certainly are appealing, and they proved that, at a time when more commoditized offerings are suffering, the company has some growth potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, even though revenue for the business improved, profitability took a hit. Net income contracted from $174 million to $166.4 million. Even on an adjusted basis, we get a contraction from $191.4 million to $189.4 million. Management blamed this weakness on higher employee-related costs and, when it came to the Solutions Group segment, investments aimed at growth opportunities. The good news is that cash flow at least increased. Operating cash flow jumped from $351.2 million to $376.8 million. If we adjust for changes in working capital, we would get a rise from $257.9 million to $281 million. And finally, EBITDA for the business expanded from $358.1 million to $367 million.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625531270142_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2288\" data-height=\"862\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625531270142_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"241\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"241\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625531270142_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625531270142_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625531270142_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625531270142_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The final quarter of the 2025 fiscal year was not a blip on the radar. In fact, even though revenue for the business has continued to grow in recent years, ever since 2024 came to an end, profitability has taken a hit. In the chart above, you can see precisely what I mean. The good news here is that management is working to correct these profit issues. For 2026, management has not provided any comprehensive financial guidance. They did provide some estimates for the first quarter, with reported sales growth estimated to be between 5% and 7%, while organic sales growth should be between 0% and 2%. Economic conditions remain problematic, but the company is targeting incremental cost savings resulting from restructuring actions of around $50 million for the year. Between that and the prospect of share buybacks, they expect earnings growth to occur this year as opposed to a contraction in earnings like what we saw last year.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625820956721_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2054\" data-height=\"934\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625820956721_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trading Multiples\" width=\"640\" height=\"291\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"291\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625820956721_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625820956721_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625820956721_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714625820956721_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond this, we don't really know what to expect. In all likelihood, the company will return additional capital to shareholders. This follows about $570 million of share buybacks during 2025 and $290 million of dividends. But unless we see a significant improvement in profitability, the stock is not cheap enough to justify a bullish outlook. In the chart above, you can see how shares are valued using results from 2024 and 2025. On an absolute basis, this is certainly not a bad picture. However, when it comes to other companies that have similarities to it, namely those in the packaging industry, it's not exactly the most compelling prospect. In that same chart, you can see that three of the five firms that I compared it to are cheaper than it is on a price-to-earnings and on an EV-to-EBITDA basis. Meanwhile, four of them are cheaper when it comes to the price-to-operating-cash-flow approach.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Long term, there certainly is potential for the business. In fact, in the image below, you can see their estimate, measured by units, of the size of the Intelligent Labels market. Across all categories that the company already plays in, it <a href=\"https://s205.q4cdn.com/945924874/files/doc_presentations/2026/Feb/16/AVY-Investor-Presentation-February-2026.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://s205.q4cdn.com/945924874/files/doc_presentations/2026/Feb/16/AVY-Investor-Presentation-February-2026.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a> the unit opportunity to be around 350 billion a year. And this is just the addressable market. It does not include the total market size that is substantially greater. What's more, in addition to focusing on growth in its existing addressable markets, the company has a history of expanding into new ones. In fact, since 2021, the company has experienced an expansion in its total addressable market of about 20 billion units. And this is because of case expansion and more established apparel and general retail businesses.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714627603703818_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2546\" data-height=\"1382\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714627603703818_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"347\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"347\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714627603703818_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714627603703818_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714627603703818_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714627603703818_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Avery Dennison</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The business has no intention of being a commoditized provider, though. It is specifically focused on what it calls high-value categories. Right now in the Materials Group segment, only 38% of sales fall under the high-value designation. But when it comes to the Solutions Group segment, that number is around 60%. For the business in its entirety, about 45% of sales come from high-value offerings, which represents a nice increase over the 33% seen back in 2019. Geographically, the company is also intensely interested in growing into emerging markets. About 39% of the revenue associated with the Materials Group segment comes from those areas. Management has not provided an estimate of how much of the revenue coming from the Solutions Group segment is attributable to emerging markets. But we do know that the overwhelming majority of sales come from developed markets like the U<span>nited States</span> and Canada, as well as Europe. In total, about 30% of the firm's revenue comes from emerging markets, though. So there should be some growth prospects there. As expansion into high-value categories increases, you can expect profit margins to grow as well.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628505373278_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2546\" data-height=\"1378\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628505373278_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"346\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"346\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628505373278_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628505373278_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628505373278_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/18/9866571-17714628505373278_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Avery Dennison</span></p></figcaption></figure> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on the data provided, I would make the case that Avery Dennison remains an interesting prospect. But honestly, it's not one that I can get behind at this time. The company is decently priced, but it's nowhere near cheap enough to justify a bullish outlook. This is especially the case considering the recent profitability issues that management has relayed to investors. So for now, I think that maintaining it as a \"Hold\" candidate is the right move.</p>",

Acadia's CEO Debra Osteen told analysts on the company's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874594-acadia-healthcare-company-inc-achc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a> yesterday:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Over the last several years, we have expanded our footprint to over 12,500 beds, taking care of 84,000 patients per day.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557057-acadia-healthcare-outlines-3_37b-3_45b-2026-revenue-target-as-new-ceo-emphasizes-operational\">guidance for 2026</a>, Acadia is expecting to generate revenues of $3.37bn -$3.45bn, adjusted EBITDA of $575m - $610m, adjusted earnings by diluted share of $1.3 $1.55, and to make capital expenditures of $255m - $280m.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, Acadia reported a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACHC/balance-sheet\">cash position</a> of $133.2m with $595m available under its $1.0bn revolving credit facility and a net leverage ratio of 4x adjusted EBITDA. The long-term debt position was reported as $(2.47bn).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Analysis - New CEO Aims for Stability</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4839184-acadia-healthcare-another-earnings-shock-but-this-time-im-optimistic\">my last note</a> on Acadia for Seeking Alpha, published after Q3 earnings in early November, I discussed how:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>In late August 2024, Acadia stock traded &gt;$80 per share - very close to its all-time high (shares traded ~$90 briefly in late 2022), but collapsed in value in September 2024 as the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4154121-acadia-healthcare-plunges-20-additional-legal-scrutiny-comes-light\">company disclosed</a> that it had received a request for information and a jury subpoena from a U.S. Attorney and jury subpoena in two jurisdictions related to its admissions, length of stay and billing practices.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the company shared annual earnings and 2025 guidance in February last year, its stock retreated further in value, to ~$30 per share, and traded at $20 per share when I published my last note.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Multiple headwinds were buffeting Acadia's business at that time - then CEO Chris Hunter told analysts that:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>patient day growth fell short of expectations due to persistent softness in acute care Medicaid volumes and heightened payor scrutiny around authorizations. In addition, revenue was negatively impacted by elevated levels of bad debt and denials, which are expected to remain a headwind in the fourth quarter.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insurers faced shrinking budgets due to higher patient healthcare utilization, coupled with the U.S. government's refusal to hike payment rates to ease the burden on the sector, heightened by the fact the government was in shutdown at the time Q3 earnings were released.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a substantial amount of debt on its balance sheet and revenue growth negligible, perhaps the slide in Acadia's share price is understandable; however, I also noted in my last post that:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>In September, it was reported that the activist investor Engine Capital, which had built up a ~3% stake in Acadia, had <a href=\"https://enginecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Engine-Capital-Sends-Letter-to-Acadia-Healthcares-Board-of-Directors-Regarding-the-Urgent-Need-for-Strategy-and-Governance-Changes.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">written</a> to Acadia's Board of Directors, demanding changes to how the business was being run.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Engine outlined a series of issues it felt needed addressing by the management team and some strategy ideas to implement going forward, namely:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Strengthen the Board and Adhere to Best Corporate Governance Practices.</li> <li>Align Executive Compensation to Shareholder Value Creation.</li> <li>Immediately Halt All Growth Capital Investments.</li> <li>Prioritize Improving Operations and Rationalize the Company’s Cost Structure.</li> <li>Explore Asset Sales Across the Company’s Portfolio.</li> <li>Repurchase Undervalued Shares..</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I suggested this could be a catalyst for positive change at the company and also noted that \"whether the CEO survives may be open to question.\" Nevertheless, I gave the stock a Buy rating, writing:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>I am making Acadia a risky Buy opportunity. It is risky because a strategic turnaround of the business may need to be executed, and if it fails, shareholders may suffer substantial losses - and the entire business broken up. If it can succeed, however, the opportunities to enhance the value of a $1.9bn market cap business earning &gt;$3.5bn revenues per annum are self-evident.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In January this year, it was <a href=\"https://bhbusiness.com/2026/01/20/acadia-healthcare-reinstates-former-ceo-amid-70-stock-plunge/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> that CEO Hunter would be leaving his role to be replaced by former CEO Debbie Osteen, a decision that was cheered by the market, with shares rising in value from ~$11.5 to &gt;$15.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yesterday during the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874594-acadia-healthcare-company-inc-achc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a>, the new/old CEO told analysts:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The focus now is on delivering quality care for patients and consistent operational performance. We have the right mission, the right markets and the right foundation to deliver improved results. This work will take discipline and consistency. We remain focused on providing care with the highest standards for our patients and the communities we serve.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In response to one analyst's question re whether low- to mid-single-digit organic volume growth, low- to mid-single-digit pricing gains, and generating margin improvement were still possible, the CEO replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>I do think the demand continues to be very strong. And I certainly don't see anything that would impact that either short term or long term.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apparently, Engine Capital <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/finance/acadia-healthcare-stock-down-60-165808686.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">reduced</a> its holding of Acadia stock on February 23rd, so its commitment to the long-term recovery of Acadia may be waning, but the return of an experienced CEO - a steady hand on the tiller at a time of crisis - is likely a net positive, in my view.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking Ahead - 2026 and Beyond</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2026 does not look like being the year Acadia returns to growth and prosperity - its issues run too deep for such a fast turnaround. On its earnings call, the Chief Financial Officer - also relatively new to the role, as the previous CFO left their position last year, as did the Chief Operating Officer - said Acadia expected to add 400-600 beds in 2026:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>primarily through the opening of new facilities nearing completion. This includes 3 facilities with joint venture partners, including new hospitals with Tufts Medicine, Methodist Health and Orlando Health.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The CFO also told analysts, \"We anticipate full-year same-facility volume growth between 0% and 1%,\" reflecting 630 new beds added to the same-store bucket in Q1, offset by \"an approximate 350 basis point headwind to the same-facility growth from changes in the New York Medicaid program.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The CFO said they expected a 2%-3% increase in same-facility revenue per patient day and outlined expectations to generate positive free cash flow \"as we expect to see CapEx decline to a range of $255 million to $280 million.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The CFO also told analysts Acadia expected to earn between $820m and $830m of revenues in Q1, with adjusted EBITDA of $130m to $137m. Meanwhile, the CEO told analysts,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>I think that we would only consider closing beds if there's no clear path to viability. And our focus right now is really on operating and improving the existing portfolio. So we're not talking about closures at this point and don't anticipate being in that situation.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49171940-17721338302879863_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1274\" data-height=\"747\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49171940-17721338302879863_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"375\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"375\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49171940-17721338302879863_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49171940-17721338302879863_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49171940-17721338302879863_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49171940-17721338302879863_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EPS bridge <span>(presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown above, EPS is expected to decline in 2026, which arguably highlights the fact that 2026 is going to be a difficult reset year, with the new management team looking to correct mistakes made by the former management team.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, at this point in Acadia's evolution, arguably the numbers - in terms of revenues and earnings, at least, are less important than the fact that the market is reacting positively to changes in strategy. It's not always normal for a business's stock to leap in value when expectations for the coming year are set so low. As the CFO put it yesterday:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>right now, we're focused on delivering in '26, ramping the new facilities we put in the ground and then being very disciplined on CapEx in the years after that as we get back to generating free cash and really showing off the cash-generating power the underlying business has now that we have these beds available and as we fill them.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Concluding Analysis: Am I Upholding My Buy Rating On Stock For 2026?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's a difficult question to answer. Acadia stock is now up &gt;50% year-to-date and ~8% since my last Buy call, which is a positive, perhaps reflecting what is known in the sports world as a \"new manager bounce.\" But can it last?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are few signs currently that the health insurance industry and government are aligned on policy or payment rates - seemingly, the government wants to pay less, while the sector demands more help - and that is a headwind that could lead Acadia to have to downgrade guidance or miss, e.g., Q1 guidance, which could reverse the goodwill Wall Street is currently showing the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, Acadia is a &gt;$3bn revenue per annum company that generated &gt;$270m of GAAP net income in 2022 and &gt;$250m in 2024, owns a large portfolio of properties, and is capable of generating significant cash flow. As mentioned, as recently as August 2024, stock traded &gt;$80 per share, a premium of &gt;250%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Often, contrarian trades look very attractive by certain metrics - price to sales and price to adjusted EBITDA in Acadia's case, plus former share price highs, but can backfire spectacularly; businesses do not typically resolve deep-seated structural issues overnight.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, then, I am torn; however, I am opting to uphold my Buy rating because managing behavioral health issues is a massive industry, and therefore, a good management team (with a proven track record) will always stand a good chance of making a business like Acadia work, in my view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is clearly not an easy business to be in, and Acadia has suffered some significant reputational damage, being subject to investigations by the<a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/acadia-healthcare-company-inc-pay-1985m-settle-allegations-relating-medically-unnecessary\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Department of Justice</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-118\" rel=\"nofollow\">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (source: behavioral health business) and having <a href=\"https://bhbusiness.com/2026/01/20/acadia-healthcare-reinstates-former-ceo-amid-70-stock-plunge/\" rel=\"nofollow\">settled</a> a securities fraud lawsuit by agreeing to pay $179m in November last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would preach extreme caution, however - last April, I identified agilon health (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AGL\" title=\"agilon health, inc.\">AGL</a>) as a potentially strong contrarian trade opportunity in the healthcare space, and shares are down 89% since that note at the time of writing.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As discussed, structural issues faced by distressed businesses often prove too deep-seated to fix, but in Acadia's case, for the time being at least, I feel as though the new CEO deserves time to implement new plans and potentially drag Acadia's business out of the doldrums.</p>",

As for Boeing (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA\" title=\"The Boeing Company\">BA</a>), 737 production increased to 42 aircraft per month and 787 to 8 aircraft per month in Q4’25; Boeing’s backlog currently sits at 6,100 aircraft. In addition to this, engine maker Pratt &amp; Whitney is supporting both the new build and aftermarket engine market, a balancing act that may provide tailwinds for CRS if capacity expands as a result of the manufacturing constraints.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aftermarket can be an appealing market for growth given the aging fleet, as new aircraft manufacturing may fall short for replacement.

Accordingly, management is expecting to add 9,000 additional tons of production through this expansion. As a result, I’m expecting CRS to have an eFY26 capital spend of $311 million, just under half of which is associated with growth projects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the increase in capacity, management is expecting the nickel-based superalloy market to remain tight as a result of the increasing demand by aerospace &amp; defense (including space) markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CRS improved the balance sheet in Q2’26 by refinancing its long-term debt, extending the maturity date to 2034 while reducing the interest rate to 5.625%. CRS also amended its revolving credit facility, expanding from $350 to $500 million. CRS closed Q2’26 with $232 million in cash &amp; equivalents and $690 million in debt on the balance sheet for a leverage ratio of 0.62x net debt/EBITDA.

Curious about this discrepancy, I found that since the fund has been around for just a couple of months and has only a few payouts so far, several characteristics simply need more time to reflect its real profile. According to the <a href=\"https://neosfunds.com/mlpi-mlp-high-income-etf/\" rel=\"nofollow\">fund’s homepage</a>, the actual distribution yield is 15.67%. That’s a more attractive figure and aligns much better with the fund’s name:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-1772120448620712.png?io=w640\" alt=\"text\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"480\" height=\"425\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-1772120448620712.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-1772120448620712.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-1772120448620712.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MLPI Distributions <span>(MLPI Website)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, it appears the fund offers an attractive monthly distribution yield along with energy‑sector exposure.

The Fund seeks appreciation in the energy infrastructure sector through its investments in the constituents of the MLP &amp; Energy Infrastructure Index. The Fund seeks to generate high monthly income from the premiums earned from the call options on the MLP ETFs.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A further description of how the fund allocates its capital:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets, plus borrowings for investment purposes, in securities of energy infrastructure MLPs and energy infrastructure companies, which the Fund defines as those companies included in the MLP &amp; Energy Infrastructure Index.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MLPX\" title=\"Global X MLP &amp; Energy Infrastructure ETF\">MLPX</a> (Global X MLP &amp; Energy Infrastructure ETF) seems to track the same index, as its holdings match very closely:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721262696463962_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1281\" data-height=\"380\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721262696463962_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"text\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"190\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721262696463962_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721262696463962_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721262696463962_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721262696463962_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MLPX Holdings <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Summary of Option Strategy</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund writes <a href=\"https://neosfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/MLPI-SumPro.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">one-month call options on an MLP ETF</a> to generate current income, effectively trading potential upside for immediate yield. While the fund benefits from index growth, its gains are somewhat capped, as losses on the call positions will limit overall returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the overall strategy description seems compelling, there is a notable weak point to consider, as I see it. As mentioned earlier, the fund currently writes only a small amount of call options against the AMLP ETF. The additional issue arises in my view because the holdings of MLPI and AMLP are not identical.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is the breakdown of the AMLP holdings for comparison:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721284780166776_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1290\" data-height=\"442\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721284780166776_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"text\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"219\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721284780166776_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721284780166776_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721284780166776_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721284780166776_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AMLP Holdings <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AMLP’s top three holdings—Energy Transfer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ET\" title=\"Energy Transfer LP Common Units\">ET</a>), Plains All American Pipeline (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PAA\" title=\"Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. Common Units\">PAA</a>), and Western Midstream (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WES\" title=\"Western Midstream Partners, LP Common Units\">WES</a>)—together account for nearly 40% of the ETF. In contrast, WES is not included in the MLPI index at all, and ET, PAA, and Plains GP Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PAGP\" title=\"Plains GP Holdings, L.P. Class A Shares\">PAGP</a>) represent only about 8.5% of MLPI. This means MLPI is selling options on an ETF whose underlying assets make up only a minority of its own portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because MLPs are generally less sensitive to direct oil and gas price movements and can be viewed as lower‑volatility, risk‑reducing infrastructure assets, the setup looks weak to me: the fund is writing options on the least volatile and most defensive part of its holdings—and one that carries limited weight in the overall portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the underlying asset selection appears to follow index rules as outlined in the fund’s prospectus, the option‑writing framework is described only as call writing on an “MLP ETF.” This implies the fund may have some flexibility in choosing which ETF to use as the option‑writing base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From my standpoint, it would arguably make more sense to write options, for example, on the MLPX ETF, which is based on the same index, is more volatile, and could generate higher option premiums.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Taxation</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the fund claims in its prospectus, it aims to be tax-efficient:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721303997307305.png?io=w640\" alt=\"text\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"586\" height=\"157\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721303997307305.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721303997307305.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721303997307305.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MLPI Tax Efficiency <span>(MLPI Website)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here are some additional explanations from their prospectus:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>Each year, you will receive an annual statement (Form 1099) of your account activity to assist you in completing your federal, state and local tax returns.</p> <p>Fund distributions are generally taxable as ordinary income, qualified dividend income, or capital gains (or a combination), unless your investment is in an individual retirement account (“IRA”) or other tax-advantaged account. Distributions on investments made through tax-deferred arrangements may be taxed later upon withdrawal of assets from those accounts. The Fund seeks tax efficient returns by utilizing index options that receive favorable tax treatment under Internal Revenue Code rules because they qualify as “Section 1256 Contracts.” Under these rules, each section 1256 contract held by the Fund at year end is treated as if it were sold at fair market value on the last business day of the tax year. If the Section 1256 contracts produce capital gain or loss, gains or losses on the Section 1256 contracts open at the end of the year, or terminated during the year, are treated as 60% long term and 40% short term, regardless of how long the contracts were held.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An example of MLPI's monthly distribution taxation summary from their homepage:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>In connection with the monthly dividend payment of $0.6739 per share payable on February 20th, 2026 to shareholders of record on February 18th, 2026, it is anticipated that 86% of such dividend will be a return of capital.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721307671679888_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"762\" data-height=\"351\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721307671679888_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"text\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"295\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721307671679888_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721307671679888_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721307671679888_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/5914651-17721307671679888_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MLPI Taxation Example <span>(MLPI Website)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund’s risks, as highlighted in its prospectus, <a href=\"https://neosfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/MLPI-SumPro.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">can be found here</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Takeaway</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In conclusion, I find MLPI to be an interesting new choice for investors seeking high yield and diversification. While its holdings closely match the MLPX ETF, the primary attractions here are the options strategy, high distribution yield with monthly payouts, and tax efficiency. However, as noted earlier, the current execution of the option-writing strategy remains questionable to me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm not a fan of actively managed funds, but MLPI seems to offer a hybrid approach—it is index-based at its core, while the option writing depends on the portfolio managers' decisions.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am giving the fund a positive rating, but I believe it is better to start with a small position and monitor its performance over time, especially compared to AMLP and MLPX.</p>",

While I acknowledge that the risk of a dividend cut even for Blackstone Secured Lending has increased lately, I maintain a strong buy rating on BXSL based on the fact that the BDC is oversold and undervalued.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well-performing private credit platform with excess coverage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Q4 2025 earnings scorecard of Blackstone Secured Lending was defined by a Y/Y drop-off in net investment income, which is the key figure that investors pay attention to in order to calculate dividend payout ratios. Blackstone Secured Lending saw $0.80 per share in net investment income, which was <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556554-blackstone-secured-lending-gaap-nii-of-080-beats-by-002-tii-of-358m-misses-by-154m\">$0.02 better than expected</a>, but the BDC's income nonetheless dropped 4.8% year-over-year due to falling interest income. In Q4 2025, BXSL generated $327M in interest income, showing a drop-off rate of 1.8%, while its operating expenses increased 1.2% Y/Y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53926820-17720320866549313_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1339\" data-height=\"582\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53926820-17720320866549313_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Blackstone Secured Lending\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"278\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53926820-17720320866549313_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53926820-17720320866549313_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53926820-17720320866549313_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53926820-17720320866549313_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Blackstone Secured Lending</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BXSL’s excess dividend coverage – the amount of NII exceeding the firm’s dividend of $0.77 per share – shrank quarter-over-quarter to just $0.03 per share in Q4 2025, but the dividend nonetheless remained fully covered.

BDCs with heavy SaaS exposure have seen massive valuation declines as investors fear that AI-driven tech will make certain software products obsolete, thereby negatively affecting valuations of loans made to SaaS and software companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While this story may make for interesting headlines, there is no concrete evidence that AI is actually having a negative impact on the sector's overall loan performance. While BXSL has a high percentage of loans to the software sector, about 21%, the underlying credit and NII performance look solid enough to me to maintain a strong buy rating. For comparison, Ares Capital, Blue Owl Capital, and Hercules Capital have SaaS/software exposure percentages of 24%, 11%, and 35%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53926820-17720327983818784.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Blackstone Secured Lending\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"582\" height=\"625\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53926820-17720327983818784.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53926820-17720327983818784.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/53926820-17720327983818784.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Blackstone Secured Lending</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>High excess safety margin for BXSL</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even higher-quality BDCs have been rerated lower in recent months due to concerns about software exposure and related AI disruption risk, causing investors to sell into the weakness. The result: top BDC firms are now priced at a significant discount to their historical valuation averages.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Blackstone Secured Lending is trading at 0.9X net asset value, about 17% below the 3-year average P/NAV. Ares Capital, one of the most established private credit platforms in the market, is trading at a 3% discount to net asset value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Blue Owl Capital – which faces a loss of trust following the failed merger with another private BDC in November 2025 – is trading at a 19% discount to net asset value. Despite merger-related issues, OBDC reported solid results for the fourth quarter, highlighting that investors may have overreacted to the current weakness in the market, as well as to the missed merger opportunity last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see BXSL as a rock-solid BDC alternative for investors valuing quality and consistency. At the very least I would expect this BDC to reprice to net asset value, which as of the end of the December quarter was $26.92 per share, although the current BDC meltdown may negatively affect investor sentiment for longer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_c5f967d9965b14273bf72be918e78719.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_c5f967d9965b14273bf72be918e78719.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_c5f967d9965b14273bf72be918e78719.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_c5f967d9965b14273bf72be918e78719.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks with BXSL</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest risk for BXSL, considering that the investment firm has seen a sequential drop-off in its dividend coverage, is obviously the risk of a dividend reset in a falling-rate world. While some BDCs have already lowered their dividends lately, such as FS KKR Capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FSK\" title=\"FS KKR Capital Corp\">FSK</a>) and Golub Capital BDC (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GBDC\" title=\"Golub Capital BDC\">GBDC</a>), I believe that a dividend cut at this point for Blackstone Secured Lending is not a credible near-term risk.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Blackstone Secured Lending remains a top BDC investment choice for income investors that want to hedge against a major downturn in the BDC market on SaaS fears: the BDC has managed to fully support its dividend in the last twelve months with net investment income, and the portfolio is overall, despite a sequential increase in the non-performing loan ratio in Q4 2025, performing well. In addition, BXSL outperforms other top BDCs such as Ares Capital and Blue Owl Capital in terms of asset quality.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I like that the SaaSpocalypse has made high-quality, first lien-focused private credit platforms a lot cheaper lately, and I am buying the drop in highly rated BDCs with excellent long-term performance records, such as ARCC, OBDC, and HTGC. The significantly reduced valuation multiplier also creates an excess safety margin for investors concerned about SaaS exposure and lower base interest rates in 2026.</p>",

Spreads have never fully normalized after what happened last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721331395462909_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"989\" data-height=\"711\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721331395462909_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Gold - difference between cash and futures largest volume contract\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"460\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721331395462909_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721331395462909_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721331395462909_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721331395462909_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 1: Spot vs Futures</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown below, gold delivery volume for February matched what was seen in December.

When metal is “delivered” it does not mean it’s leaving the Comex. It means that Registered ownership is moving from one party to another. When the metal leaves the vault, that is where things get interesting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown, last year saw a major influx as the arbitrage trade took hold, but that metal has been flowing back out. In the latest month, Registered metal saw quite a large down move. This metal did not flow into Eligible, which stayed relatively flat. Instead, the metal left the vault entirely. This shows sustained <em>physical</em> demand for gold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333598150218_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"952\" data-height=\"708\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333598150218_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Gold inventory levels\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"476\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333598150218_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333598150218_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333598150218_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333598150218_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 5: Inventory Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead to the March delivery period (a minor month for gold), we see a contract that is hovering near the average but seeing some selling pressure with 2 days remaining.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333964515145_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"997\" data-height=\"691\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333964515145_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Gold open interest countdown to contract first positions date\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"444\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333964515145_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333964515145_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333964515145_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721333964515145_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 6: Open Interest Countdown</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the massive surge in inventory, the open interest relative to physical stocks is actually lower.

Almost $2B of silver was delivered in the minor month of February.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721335695398815_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"941\" data-height=\"718\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721335695398815_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Silver historical notional deliveries for Feb\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"488\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721335695398815_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721335695398815_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721335695398815_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721335695398815_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 10: Notional Deliveries</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similar to gold, net new contracts were a driver until stalling out mid-month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336153452246_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1000\" data-height=\"726\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336153452246_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Silver cumulative net new contracts after first position\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"465\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336153452246_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336153452246_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336153452246_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336153452246_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 11: Cumulative Net New Contracts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Silver-eligible inventories are being removed from the vault at a pretty rapid clip.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336476544783_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"948\" data-height=\"704\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336476544783_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Silver inventory levels eligible\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"475\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336476544783_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336476544783_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336476544783_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336476544783_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Figure 12: Inventory Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Registered metal (metal available for delivery) is also seeing major outflows. Since September, there has been a massive drawdown in Registered supplies. This is further evidence of strain in the physical market. Investors are taking delivery and moving it out of the vault. If we fall below 50M ounces, then Comex physical supplies will start to be extremely strained. While Eligible still has decent supply, much of that metal is not available for delivery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336866354828_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"967\" data-height=\"704\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58280443-17721336866354828_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Silver inventory levels -

That said, demand remains strong despite the all-time highs in price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Silver is showing significant demand and metal is leaving the vault at a rapid clip. This is a market in backwardation, facing high demand, record prices, and metal leaving the vault. This is a perfect storm for silver. After the strong pullback in January, we have seen a lot of speculative money get flushed out. While there are still speculators in this market, there are also big buyers with a strong physical appetite. This is going to put a lot of pressure on the Comex in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.schiffgold.com/exploring-finance/comex-silver-supplies-continue-to-shrink-rapidly\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p>",

My primary concern here is not the health of the hyperscalers but the sustainability of their spending. For this spending to be sustainable, these companies need to show a proportional increase in the free cash flow from AI services. If not, their shareholders will eventually force a capex pivot. Because Nvidia’s revenue is so concentrated, even a 10% reduction in capex across these five customers could account for a $10 billion ($215 billion x 50% x (100%-90%)) hit on Nvidia’s top line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is also unclear as to what portion of the diversified revenue is from startups that are funded by the hyperscalers. If the Big Five reduce their direct buying, it would be accompanied by a reduction in venture investments in the ecosystem. Because the tail of these smaller customers is tethered to the head of the hyperscalers, the concentration risk is higher than it looks on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/income-statement\">income statement</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Compute is Revenue?

It helps to look at both the diversions in the graph above.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Test-time scaling allows a model to think longer before answering. You might have noted this in the chatbots that have toggle switches to think longer. This, understandably, is supposed to consume several times more compute than the faster mode. Inference was supposed to be cheap, but test-time scaling made inference expensive again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, test-time scaling turned out to be <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12215\" rel=\"nofollow\">optimal</a> when done through parallel scaling strategies. This meant that they could be distributed across separate chips or data centers more easily than training loops. Why is this relevant? Because it makes test-time scaling a commodity workload. If Microsoft has to spend a dollar of compute on Nvidia H100s but they can achieve the same for 30 cents on their Maia chips, they have a fiduciary duty to switch. So while test-time scaling increases the total addressable market for compute, it could simultaneously undercut Nvidia’s pricing power within that market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The post-training scaling also undercuts the comment about compute being too tied to revenues. Distillation is a post-training scaling method, and OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>) <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-accuses-deepseek-distilling-us-213928567.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">claimed</a> DeepSeek (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DEEPSEEK\" title=\"Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd.\">DEEPSEEK</a>) used distillation to train their own models. If a $5 million distillation can replicate the reasoning capabilities of a $500 million training run, then the “Compute = Revenue” equation suffers from a huge deflation. So I remain very skeptical of this idea that you need to burn more silicon to get more value.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation and Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia trades at ~$23x FY27 earnings estimates. That looks reasonable for a company growing at this pace. However, a lot of the incremental revenue is likely coming from the same concentrated set of customers for the next two years. Pressure in hyperscaler stocks indicates they are already pushing the limits on capital intensity. Not to mention the consensus revenue growth in the second year (FY28) is around 23%. So we had two years of triple-digit growth followed by two years of mid-60s percentage growth, which is expected to be followed by a much steeper descent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48014573-1772131849426464_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1472\" data-height=\"467\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48014573-1772131849426464_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nvidia Consensus Estimates\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"203\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48014573-1772131849426464_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48014573-1772131849426464_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48014573-1772131849426464_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48014573-1772131849426464_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Nvidia Consensus Estimates <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A 23x multiple is cheap for a company exhibiting hypergrowth, but it is fair-to-expensive for a company entering a deceleration curve with a concentrated set of customers.
