A favorable backdrop of positive global growth, falling interest rates across the developed markets, and a lack of pronounced negative<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> news fueled a surge in investors’ appetite for risk. Most notably, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) cut rates by a quarter point in September, and the markets anticipated that additional easing could be in store over the months ahead.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors were further cheered by positive corporate earnings reports and the relatively limited initial economic impact from tariffs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These developments helped propel major equity indexes to a series of all-time highs. The United States led the way higher behind renewed enthusiasm about the artificial intelligence theme and the technology sector more broadly. Small- cap stocks, which benefited from the improving interest rate outlook and investors’ preference for risk, performed particularly well. The emerging markets were another top performer, with China registering an impressive gain amid revived optimism about the country’s economic outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The global fixed-income markets also produced positive returns, reflecting the increasingly favorable shift in Fed policy. Longer-term debt and credit-oriented categories generally provided the best results.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Contributors and detractors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Asset allocation was a slight detractor from the fund’s relative performance in the quarter. An underweight in U.S. large-cap stocks and corresponding overweights in defensive equities, mid caps, and the international markets were the primary drivers of the modest shortfall. On the other hand, an overweight in stocks and underweight in bonds positioned the fund to capitalize on the favorable market environment. Diversification into a real assets portfolio—which was helped by its position in metals and mining stocks—also contributed to performance. An overweight in emerging-market bonds in the fixed-income portfolio was a further positive.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio changes</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment conditions remained broadly positive at the close of the period, highlighted by ongoing optimism related to economic conditions and global central bank policy. However, valuations have become fairly full across many areas of the equity and fixed-income markets. With this in mind, we maintain a diversified portfolio designed to hold up through a wide range of possible outcomes. We think it’s better to keep a long-term view rather than trying to chase returns in specific categories. We believe this approach should hold the fund in good stead over time, and we think its merits may become increasingly apparent if the market backdrop becomes less favorable than investors are anticipating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Average annual total returns<sup>1,2,3 %</sup> </h2> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Qtd</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Ytd</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>1 yr</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>3 yr</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>5 yr</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>10 yr</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Since inception</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Inception date</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Class R6 without sales charge 4.39</p></td> <td><p>11.20</p></td> <td><p>8.56</p></td> <td><p>13.03</p></td> <td><p>7.12</p></td> <td><p>7.88</p></td> <td><p>7.03</p></td> <td><p>11/7/13</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Class R4 without sales charge 4.39</p></td> <td><p>11.02</p></td> <td><p>8.31</p></td> <td><p>12.73</p></td> <td><p>6.85</p></td> <td><p>7.66</p></td> <td><p>6.81</p></td> <td><p>11/7/13</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>S&amp;P Target Date 2025 Index 4.54</p></td> <td><p>11.64</p></td> <td><p>9.41</p></td> <td><p>13.31</p></td> <td><p>7.47</p></td> <td><p>7.66</p></td> <td><p>6.80</p></td> <td><p>—</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>John Hancock 2025 Lifetime 4.98</p></td> <td><p>11.98</p></td> <td><p>8.57</p></td> <td><p>13.41</p></td> <td><p>7.38</p></td> <td><p>8.57</p></td> <td><p>7.69</p></td> <td><p>—</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Target-date 2025 category 4.28</p></td> <td><p>8.91</p></td> <td><p>6.58</p></td> <td><p>11.93</p></td> <td><p>6.05</p></td> <td><p>6.83</p></td> <td><p>—</p></td> <td><p>—</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Expense</strong><strong>ratios</strong>4</p></td> <td><p><strong>Gross</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Net </strong><strong>(what </strong><strong>you</strong><strong> pay)</strong></p></td> <td> <p><strong>Contractual</strong></p> <p><strong>through</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Class R6</p></td> <td><p>0.70%</p></td> <td><p>0.35%</p></td> <td><p>12/31/2025</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Class R4</p></td> <td><p>1.05%</p></td> <td><p>0.60%</p></td> <td><p>12/31/2025</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td>The performance data shown represents past performance, which does not guarantee future results.

The portfolio is subject to the same risks as the underlying funds and exchange-traded funds in which it invests: Stocks and bonds can decline due to adverse issuer, market, regulatory, or economic developments; foreign investing, especially in emerging markets, has additional risks, such as currency and market volatility and political and social instability; the securities of small companies are subject to higher volatility than those of larger, more established companies; and high-yield bonds are subject to additional risks, such as increased risk of default. Each portfolio’s name refers to the approximate retirement year of the investors for whom the portfolio’s asset allocation strategy is designed. The portfolios with dates further off initially allocate more aggressively to stock funds. As a portfolio approaches and passes its target date, the allocation will gradually migrate to more conservative, fixed-income funds. The principal value of each portfolio is not guaranteed, and you could lose money at any time, including at, or after, the target date. Liquidity—the extent to which a security may be sold or a derivative position closed without negatively affecting its market value, if at all—may be impaired by reduced trading volume, heightened volatility, rising interest rates, and other market conditions. Hedging and other strategic transactions may increase volatility and result in losses if not successful. Please see the portfolio’s prospectus for additional risks.</em></p> <p><strong>The </strong><strong>S&amp;P </strong><strong>Target </strong><strong>Date </strong><strong>2025 </strong><strong>Index </strong>represents a broadly derived consensus of asset class exposure and glide path for target-date year 2025.

One of the primary ingredients of the AI economy is technologies that lie at the very nucleus of data transfer, namely connective tech, including solutions for the 5G and 6G networks. And for investors who would like to get exposure to the theme, there are a few vehicles to consider, including the Defiance Connective Technologies ETF (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SIXG\" title=\"Defiance Connective Technologies ETF\">SIXG</a></span>), a passively managed exchange-traded fund that we will be discussing today.</p> <h2 id=\"basics-of-the-defiance-connective-technologies-etf\">Basics Of The Defiance Connective Technologies ETF</h2> <ul> <li>SIXG is a passively managed ETF with an inception date of March 4, 2019.</li> <li>The ETF represents the Technology subclass of the Sector Equity class.</li> <li>Defiance ETFs, LLC is the investment adviser, while Penserra Capital Management LLC is the sub-adviser.</li> <li>As of October 29, 2025, SIXG's assets under management were at $695.36 million, which is almost 5.4x the median AUM for the subclass.</li> <li>SIXG's expense ratio is 0.30%, which is notably below the median ER for the subclass of 0.55%.</li> </ul> <h2 id=\"what-does-sixg-do\">What Does SIXG Do?</h2> <p>As we know from the factsheet available on the Defiance ETFs <a href=\"https://www.defianceetfs.com/sixg/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.defianceetfs.com/sixg/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, SIXG is a thematic, passively managed vehicle offering exposure to \"connective technology enablers crucial to the AI revolution,\" namely, to the 5G and 6G tech that</p> <blockquote><p>...provide the infrastructure needed for AI applications that demand high-speed connectivity, low latency, and massive data processing capabilities.</p></blockquote> <p>Importantly, established in March 2019, SIXG underwent changes in 2024.</p> <ul> <li>First, before July 22, 2024, SIXG <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/defiance-announces-name-and-ticker-symbol-change-fivg-sixg-defiance-connective\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/defiance-announces-name-and-ticker-symbol-change-fivg-sixg-defiance-connective\" target=\"_blank\">was known as</a> the Defiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF and had a ticker FIVG.</li> <li>Second, on September 23, 2024, SIXG started tracking the BlueStar® Connective Technologies Index that replaced the BlueStar 5G Communications Index. The changes were <a href=\"https://www.marketvector.com/insights/index-updates/rule-name-ticker-changes-of-bfivg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://www.marketvector.com/insights/index-updates/rule-name-ticker-changes-of-bfivg\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> by MarketVector <span id=\"jS$308\" class=\"j3\">Indexes</span> in July 2024.</li> </ul> <p>As explained on page 14 of the prospectus:</p> <blockquote><p>Effective September 23, 2024, the Fund’s investment objective changed to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the BlueStar® Connective Technologies Index. Prior to September 23, 2024, the Fund’s investment objective was to track the total return performance, before fees and expenses, of the BlueStar 5G Communications Index. Performance shown for periods prior to September 23, 2024, is that of the BlueStar 5G Communications Index.</p></blockquote> <h3 id=\"-\"> </h3> <p>In essence, as we can see in the old and new index universe rules comparison in the press release, while these indices have quite a lot in common, the key differences are that the connective tech index also includes companies involved with \"the rollout of 5G, or 6G networks,\" while the previous one was focused on the 5G networks only. Plus, \"satellite-based internet technology/providers\" was added to the universe.</p> <p>Still, investors should understand that although the indices have rather similar premises, the performance that SIXG delivered prior to the strategy change, though certainly of use and not to be ignored, should be treated with caution, as it is not necessarily indicative of the ETF's potential.</p> <p>For context, my calculations show that the SIXG portfolio as of October 27, 2025, has just a 68.8% overlap with the FIVG portfolio <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4547652-fivg-etf-has-5g-theme-become-cheap-enough\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4547652-fivg-etf-has-5g-theme-become-cheap-enough\" target=\"_blank\">as of October 18</a>, 2022. Moreover, it is quite notable that the basket became substantially leaner, with 50 equities vs. 86 as of October 2022.</p> <h2 id=\"how-is-the-index-calibrated\">How Is The Index Calibrated?</h2> <p>As of October 2025, SIXG tracks the BlueStar® Connective Technologies Index, which features a modified market cap weighting scheme.</p> <p>As explained by the ETF, this index is composed of</p> <blockquote><p>... companies whose business activity, products, or services meet the technical standards for, are used in the development of, or are otherwise instrumental in the rollout of 5G, or 6G networks, and other connective technologies...</p></blockquote> <p>To qualify, they must generate no less than 50% of their revenues from a rather vast group of technologies that are detailed on page 9 of the prospectus:</p> <blockquote><p>The Fund defines Connective Technology Companies to include: (i) manufacturers of core carrier grade networking equipment, including cellular antennas, routers and related semiconductor devices, (ii) satellite-based internet technology manufacturers and providers, (iii) mobile network operators (“MNOs”), (iv) enhanced mobile broadband chips and smart phone manufacturers, (v) manufacturers of new radio technology, wireless network test and optimization equipment, and cloud computing equipment, (vi) manufacturers and providers of software defined networking or network functions virtualization - including companies that focus on network/cloud analytics and monitoring platforms, and (vii) cell tower or data center real estate investment trusts (“REITs”).</p></blockquote> <h2 id=\"what-returns-has-sixg-been-capable-of-delivering\">What Returns Has SIXG Been Capable Of Delivering?</h2> <p>Let us look at the returns the ETF delivered before and after its strategy was refocused from the 5G communications to the connective tech.</p> <p>First, from March 5, 2019, to September 22, 2024, SIXG has considerably underperformed the overall market as represented by the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVV\" title=\"iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF\">IVV</a>) as well as the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust ETF\">QQQ</a>).</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

IVV was selected as a benchmark by the author</em></p> <p>All in all, SIXG has a rather expectable performance for a vehicle heavy in growth stocks: it does excellent in bull markets and underperforms dismally when bears dictate the rules.</p> <h2 id=\"who-is-sixg-for-and-how-does-it-fit-in-a-portfolio\">Who Is SIXG For, And How Does It Fit In A Portfolio?</h2> <p>SIXG might be an ETF of choice for investors seeking to profit from the 5G and 6G themes and who believe that passively managed vehicles targeting the communication sector, like the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR® ETF Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLC\" title=\"The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR® ETF Fund\">XLC</a>), simply do not offer enough exposure to them.</p> <p>Sure, they should be very fond of the growth factor and have little to no interest in value stocks (they are still present in SIXG but have a rather modest impact on its returns), and understand the risks that high achievers with generous valuations come with.</p> <p>As to the popular core-satellite system, SIXG looks like a decent satellite holding, with a core of the portfolio possibly being either IVV or any other S&amp;P 500 ETF like the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VOO\" title=\"Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF\">VOO</a>), the SPDR® S&amp;P 500® ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR® S&amp;P 500® ETF\">SPY</a>), and the SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPLG\" title=\"SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® ETF\">SPLG</a>), or QQQ.</p> <p>Importantly, position sizing is always key when building a tech-focused portfolio from various thematic blocks, as high-beta baskets of growthier stocks can deliver quite sensitive losses when conditions turn gloomy (marked by too high inflation, shifts in monetary policy from dovish to hawkish regimes, an overall weak macro environment, etc.). So investors should have a clear understanding of what share of their portfolios they can allocate to higher-risk names and what they are planning to do if these stocks enter a long period of losses.</p> <p>For context, in 2022 (even though the strategy was a little different back then, there is still some overlap with the current one), the ETF, traded with a ticker FIVG, delivered a maximum drawdown of 30.8% (vs. IVV's 23.93%), and its loss for the year was 27.25% (vs. IVV's loss of 18.16%).</p> <h2 id=\"how-is-sixg-built\">How Is SIXG Built?</h2> <p>As of October 27, 2025, there were 52 holdings in the SIXG portfolio, including 50 equities, the First American Government Obligations Fund 12/01/2031 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FGXXX\" title=\"First American Government Obligations Fund Inst\">FGXXX</a>), and cash &amp; other, with the latter two accounting for 0.24%.</p> <p>The top holding was Apple Inc.

(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T\" title=\"AT&amp;T Inc.\">T</a>), but their impact on the weighted average figures is modest). Also, these high achievers are quite volatile, with 43% of the portfolio allocated to names with a 24-month beta of 1.5 or higher, as per my calculations. High P/E plus high-growth plus high beta means excellent returns in bull markets. In bear markets and corrections, this is a recipe for disaster.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td>Metrics</td> <td><strong>SIXG</strong></td> <td>IVV</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Market Cap, $ Billion</td> <td><strong>582.85</strong></td> <td>1,397</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Adjusted EY</td> <td><strong>2.78%</strong></td> <td>3.49%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Adjusted P/S</td> <td><strong>9.60</strong></td> <td>9.40</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Adjusted EV/EBITDA</td> <td><strong>25.37</strong></td> <td>22.23</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Revenue Fwd</td> <td><strong>12.99%</strong></td> <td>14.00%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>EPS Fwd</td> <td><strong>20.68%</strong></td> <td>20.22%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>EBITDA Fwd</td> <td><strong>17.25%</strong></td> <td>17.84%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Adjusted Return on Equity</td> <td><strong>14.39%</strong></td> <td>20.47%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Return on Assets</td> <td><strong>8.92%</strong></td> <td>15.79%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Return on Total Capital</td> <td><strong>11.61%</strong></td> <td>19.34%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>24M Beta</td> <td><strong>1.44</strong></td> <td>1.13</td> </tr> <tr> <td>60M Beta</td> <td><strong>1.33</strong></td> <td>1.15</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Quant Valuation B- or higher</td> <td><strong>20.42%</strong></td> <td>7.11%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Quant Growth B- or higher</td> <td><strong>52.07%</strong></td> <td>44.44%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Quant Profitability B- or higher</td> <td><strong>82.73%</strong></td> <td>93.76%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Quant EPS Revisions B- or higher</td> <td><strong>73.12%</strong></td> <td>74.57%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Quant Momentum B- or higher</td> <td><strong>61.47%</strong></td> <td>64.94%</td> </tr> </table>\n<span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button>\n</div> <p><em>Calculated by the author using data from Seeking Alpha and the ETFs. Financial data as of October 27, 2025. The weighted average Price/Sales and EV/EBITDA were adjusted for the impact of outliers, with those multiples at over 100x. For the WA earnings yield, EYs for loss-making companies were removed.</em></p> <h3 id=\"size-and-value\"><strong>Size And Value</strong></h3> <ul> <li>With just three trillion-dollar companies in the portfolio (vs. nine in IVV), SIXG has a weighted average market cap about 2.4x smaller.</li> <li>Despite that, its portfolio appears much more generously valued, as illustrated by its smaller adjusted WA earnings yield, as well as much higher adjusted WA Price/Sales and Enterprise Value/EBITDA. This creates meaningful risks investors should be prepared for.</li> </ul> <h3 id=\"growth\"><strong class=\"highlighted_text\">Growth</strong></h3> <p>SIXG has a stronger weighted average forward earnings growth rate, which partly explains why its EY is quite low (and translates into an almost 36x Price/Earnings) compared to IVV, plus more than half of its net assets are allocated to companies with a B- Quant Growth grade or higher. Still, the S&amp;P 500 ETF is offering more appealing forward revenue and EBITDA growth rates.</p> <h3 id=\"quality\"><strong class=\"highlighted_text\">Quality</strong></h3> <p>Most of <span id=\"jS$2311\" class=\"j3\">SIXG's</span> holdings are high-quality companies with capital efficiency indicators and margins at quite healthy levels. However, IVV is considerably stronger here. For instance, it has a larger exposure to companies with a B- Quant Profitability grade or higher.</p> <h3 id=\"low-volatility\"><strong>Low Volatility</strong></h3> <p>SIXG is much more into high-beta stocks than IVV. The bull markets are a boon for high-beta names, as they tend to capture over 100% of the S&amp;P 500 ETF's upside, delivering impressive gains. However, their losses in bear markets can be rather painful.</p> <h2 id=\"sixg-risks\">SIXG Risks</h2> <p>Like any other theme-focused ETF favoring growthier tech names, SIXG has two key risks.</p> <h3 id=\"high-achiever-valuation-risk\"><strong>High-Achiever Valuation Risk</strong></h3> <p>Companies with strong growth prospects, lofty multiples, and high beta — exactly those that account for the bulk of the ETF's net assets — are extremely sensitive to periods of market stress. In other words, deterioration in macro conditions, including, for instance, too high inflation, can be detrimental for SIXG's performance, resulting in steep losses, with a good example being 2022 (back then, its maximum drawdown was 30.84%).</p> <h3 id=\"theme-popularity-risk\"><strong>Theme Popularity Risk</strong></h3> <p>There is a risk that the 5G/6G theme will become less and less popular with ETF investors, with asset flows switching to newer and more promising areas (i.e., pure-play AI-focused vehicles), even though the rise of the \"AI connectivity\" sub-theme might partly compensate for that.</p> <p>Still, the fact is, SIXG saw some impressive inflows in the past, with AUM <a href=\"https://www.defianceetfs.com/the-first-5g-etf-fivg-hits-1-billion-in-aum/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.defianceetfs.com/the-first-5g-etf-fivg-hits-1-billion-in-aum/\" target=\"_blank\">surpassing</a> $1 billion in January 2021.

Since then, the solid data center investment pipeline has pushed NVDA to become the world’s most valuable company. Apart from that, the AI frenzy is fueling the market bubble fears due to the circular large-scale investments between the main AI players. And because of the long-term nature of the investment plans, there will <span>always</span><span> </span>be skepticism about how many of those investments will break ground. In my view, the three-year horizon is quite a long-term period, as the dynamics of the trade disputes and geopolitical tensions cannot be really predicted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, let’s take a look at the current supply chain stance. TSMC projected mid-30% revenue growth due to the accelerating demand for AI and HPC chips from hyperscalers and AI-accelerator customers. The utilization of the leading-edge node is expected to be very high as the demand is surging. At the same time, the HBM supply is shaping up to be <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509111-sk-group-chairman-says-rapid-development-of-ai-data-centers-creating-bottlenecks\">tight,</a> with SK hynix Inc.

In addition, Amkor <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509068-amkor-outlines-7b-arizona-campus-investment-and-projects-double-digit-q4-revenue-growth\">increased</a> its total investments for the new advanced packaging and test campus in Arizona up to $7 billion. Going further, Vertiv Holdings Co (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VRT\" title=\"Vertiv Holdings Co\">VRT</a>) reported surging orders and a robust backlog due to the strong <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4506587-vertiv-surges-9-percent-after-earnings-beat-raised-guidance-on-soaring-ai-infrastructure\">AI-driven demand</a> for digital infrastructure solutions such as power management, cooling systems and integrated data center platforms. Overall, the demand is prominently outstripping supply, and Microsoft Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) forecasts show a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-09/microsoft-forecasts-show-data-center-crunch-persisting-into-2026?srnd=phx-technology\" rel=\"nofollow\">data center crunch</a> persisting into 2026 as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But apart from the AI bubble, the competitive landscape is rising over. Besides the ASICs' collusions, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) is progressing to be the most fearful alternative with a full-stack Helios rack-scale AI platform, which is believed to be on par with Vera Rubin. Both systems feature 72 GPUs onboard and are expected to enter mass production in the back half of 2026. Now, let’s recall AMD’s $500 billion data center AI accelerator TAM estimate in 2028. The figure now seems more than viable given the fact that big tech is expected to dedicate more than $344 billion this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"664\" data-height=\"295\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Big Tech Capex\" width=\"640\" height=\"284\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Big Tech Capex <span>(Bloomberg)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The capital investments are growing at an impressive pace, with quarterly Capex from Meta, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft approaching the $100 billion level combined. On the other hand, another <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500250-citi-sees-big-tech-hyperscalers-spending-2_8t-by-2029\">forecast</a> from Citi is pointing to $490 billion in AI Capex across the hyperscalers already in 2026 and a total of $2.8 trillion through 2029. And while I used to take the projections made by Nvidia’s executives with a grain of salt, the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4817296-nvidia-corporation-nvda-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">$3-4 trillion</a> in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade seems reasonable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But let’s stick to the $500 billion AI accelerator market size scenario, which is still a significant jump compared to some $130 billion in 2024. If we suppose that Nvidia would maintain around 60% market share, it suggests up to $300 billion in revenue from the data center segment in 2028, or circa 30% CAGR. Despite growing by 56% YoY in the second fiscal quarter of 2025, the company will come down to such a growth dynamic at some point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Data center segment revenue\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"578\" height=\"422\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Data center segment revenue <span>(Nvidia presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nonetheless, this projection is far more conservative compared to Jensen Huang’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510295-nvidia-makes-history-as-it-shatters-5t-market-cap-ceiling\">visibility</a> into half a trillion in sales for Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin through 2026. This figure most likely includes the partnership with OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>) to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia AI systems. Indeed, with the rollout of Blackwell Ultra systems, Nvidia is going to dominate the market in 2026 as well. However, we should discern the visibility from when this revenue is actually going to be recognized. And even if AMD comes up with a superior rack-scale platform, the point is that such a big market share is not going to dissipate any time soon. Because, as I wrote in my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797121-amd-from-an-alternative-to-an-equal\">latest piece</a> on AMD, the main advantage of Nvidia is in the timing between architectural generations. AMD opted for a new process technology for its MI350 series, which took time for the transition to the 3nm lithography.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, Nvidia switched to a double-die package, effectively doubling the performance of the Hopper generation while staying at the same process node. Moreover, Nvidia is planning to shift its roadmap to only an <a href=\"https://wccftech.com/nvidia-has-already-geared-up-to-challenge-big-tech-custom-ai-chip-ambitions/\" rel=\"nofollow\">eight-month gap</a> in production ramp-up, which could be highly beneficial, especially when the market for AI systems continues to be supply chain-restricted.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reversion angle</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Against the backdrop of the AI bubble fears, it’s hard to believe that a company worth nearly $5 trillion with a 50% stock price gain since the beginning of the year is fairly valued. I used to mention that a 30% growth reversion angle could bring the valuation of NVDA stock down to the low 20x in FY2028. Apparently, it went so much faster due to the rapid expansion of data center build-outs. And looking at the chart now, the company is trading at 33.4x forward P/E, which is slightly below the 3-year median of 33.6x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1019\" data-height=\"628\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Valuation of NVDA; P/E left; EPS right\" width=\"640\" height=\"394\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Valuation of NVDA; P/E left; EPS right <span>(prepared by author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>*The two dotted lines represent one standard deviation above and below the median line.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, we can see that NVDA stock is clearly valued at its fair level, climbing from the bottom line of one standard deviation below the median from the time of my last piece. Basically, when you have a stock with the potential to grow at least by 30% and trading at a 30x multiple, it’s a good indication of a reasonable investment. I could confirm this with the following chart, which highlights that the earnings vector used moves in sync with the price performance dynamic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going forward, I prefer to stick with a 30% growth angle to form a more conservative scenario. I believe that NVDA stock has room for 30% multiple expansions for the next 12-month horizon, or up to 43x forward P/E ratio. Given the analyst forecast of $6.02 EPS next year, this indicates a $261 value per share, which stipulates a 25% upside potential.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Investment takeaways</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With superior computing power and deep optimization, Nvidia accelerators deliver the world's highest performance for AI workloads, benefiting from the NVLink technology. Apart from that, the company develops high-performance networking (InfiniBand and Spectrum-X) solutions that enable the interconnection of large-scale clusters, which is especially relevant when we are talking about data center projects in gigawatt measure. The CUDA software stack is another strength, which has effectively become the industry standard, enabling the adaptation of GPUs to solve a wide range of computational tasks. These three pillars help Nvidia to retain customers in its ecosystem, due to the lack of meaningful substitution offerings, at least until the end of 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apart from that, Nvidia is continuously teaming up with industry leaders to ensure its technology remains at the forefront amid the AI revolution. The scope of investment into data center build-outs is constantly growing, representing a strong growth potential visibility. The demand signals make tech giants spend relentlessly on artificial intelligence, with Microsoft planning to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510964-microsoft-outlines-fy26-capital-expenditure-acceleration-as-ai-demand-drives-80-percent-ai\">double</a> its data center footprint over the next 2 years, Meta signaling a strong Capex expansion, and Alphabet approaching $100 billion in investments for the year.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, I believe that NVDA deserves a Buy recommendation even at a $5 trillion market cap. It remains to be seen how much of that revenue visibility mentioned at the GTC will even be recognized in the following five quarters. But definitely, Nvidia has the potential to grow at least by 30% in the near term, which, against the backdrop of a low 30s valuation multiple, looks like a good entry point. And even with a conservative expectation for TAM potential, NVDA stock still has 25% upside for the next 12-month horizon.</p>",

(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GM\" title=\"General Motors Company\">GM</a>) and Ford Motor Co. <span class=\"highlighted_text\">(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/F\" title=\"Ford Motor Company\">F</a>), h</span>ave booked massive losses, worker layoffs, and write-offs—with more to come—due to slow consumer acceptance of their first BEV models. Outside of China, where BEVs may be heavily subsidized and encouraged, automakers are now introducing BEVs more slowly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Governments, too, are rethinking policies meant to incentivize BEVs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seamless technology</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In truth, many buyers will be unaware that their 2026 RAV4 is powered by a combination of a gasoline engine and a battery-powered electric motor; the system smoothly and quietly (according to this writer’s experience during a test drive) produces an average fuel efficiency of up to 44 miles to the gallon, combined city and highway, according to Toyota’s estimate. The RAV4’s battery receives charge from the engine, meaning that it doesn’t need external charging.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A second RAV4 version, the plug-in hybrid, has a larger battery than the standard gas-electric and must be charged; it offers an emission-free, electric-only range of about 52 miles before the gasoline engine kicks in to power the vehicle in hybrid mode. The plug-in may be operated without charging as well, and can be driven in gas-electric hybrid mode exclusively.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2337\" data-height=\"1587\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"infographic\" width=\"640\" height=\"435\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"435\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Rise of gas electric hybrids <span>(Wards Intelligence)</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Toyota says the new RAV4 will be the first of its product line to feature the newest version of the Toyota Auto Multimedia system, which offers “faster, more responsive voice assistant; a new customizable home menu; and Toyota's first application of onboard 5G connectivity.” Toyota had been criticized for earlier infotainment systems that excluded Apple CarPlay and Android systems; the automaker has since changed course and allowed its system to be more easily paired and synced with smartphones.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Toyota builds a majority of its vehicles in North America, those imported from Canada and Mexico have been subject to the administration’s tariffs. The new RAV4 will be built primarily in Georgetown, Ky., and Cambridge, Ontario, with some models imported from Japan. Accordingly, Toyota in August said its operating profit for the fiscal year ended March 30 is estimated to be reduced to $21.7 billion, or 16.3%, from its prior forecast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Toyota shares shrugged off the guidance, rising about 15% since then while outperforming major market indices.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rising taxes</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, tariffs remain a major stumbling block in front of earnings growth. Toyota has formulated a response, however, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4827928-toyota-moving-forward-with-a-strategic-way-to-play-the-tariffs\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4827928-toyota-moving-forward-with-a-strategic-way-to-play-the-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\">which was outlined earlier this month</a> by Seeking Alpha analyst James Hires earlier this month. Bolstered by its vaunted financial strength, the automaker has elected to absorb a significant portion of the tariff burden by limiting price hikes that it otherwise might have taken. Last June, Toyota evidently increased prices by a smaller margin than those of competitors, thus improving its value proposition, which should help to drive sales.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1322\" data-height=\"760\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"car\" width=\"640\" height=\"368\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"368\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">2026 RAV4 plug-in hybrid version <span>(Toyota Motor)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, Toyota has told U.S. trade officials it is looking to export U.S.-made models to Japan, a move designed to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4508823-toyota-has-a-strategy-to-appease-the-trump-administration\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4508823-toyota-has-a-strategy-to-appease-the-trump-administration\" target=\"_blank\">“appease” the U.S. administration</a> and help redress the trade deficit with Japan, which was about $70 billion in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the Tokyo Mobility Show this week, the automaker took the wraps off a BEV concept of the next-gen Corolla compact sedan, the best-selling model in its history, with more than 55 million manufactured since the nameplate was introduced in 1966. The show car attracted rave reviews from journalists, one of whom said it <a href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/news/toyota-corolla-concept-tokyo-show-first-look\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.motortrend.com/news/toyota-corolla-concept-tokyo-show-first-look\" target=\"_blank\">was “seriously cool.” </a> While it wasn’t clear when the production version of the Corolla would be introduced, Japanese carmakers usually don’t wait long after the concept is revealed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reports on the new Corolla say it will have more interior space, made possible by a new generation of engines that are more compact and powerful than current models. The model may accommodate batteries, hybrids, or possibly alternative fuels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">“The Corolla is a global car, so it has to meet different powertrain requirements in different regions,” Chief Engineer Toru Fukushima <a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/toyota/an-toyota-new-corolla-concept-ev-hybrid-2025-japan-mobility-show-1028/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.autonews.com/toyota/an-toyota-new-corolla-concept-ev-hybrid-2025-japan-mobility-show-1028/\" target=\"_blank\">told Automotive News</a> at a pre-show briefing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bullish on TM ADRs</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My bullish investment thesis is based on a number of core factors, some of which are reflected in the new RAV4. First of all is operating discipline, which reflects a relentless pursuit of researching those traits and features in a vehicle that consumers prioritize and delivering them in an affordable package.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A second key factor is what has proven to be a shrewd strategic direction with regard to electrification, that's a gradual migration toward zero emission that currently emphasizes gas-electric hybrid powertrains—exemplified by the decision to offer the latest RAV4 as an all-hybrid product. Since the 1990s, when the first <a href=\"https://pressroom.toyota.com/driving-innovation-celebrating-25-years-of-the-toyota-prius/#:~:text=First%20Generation:%202001%20%E2%80%93%202003,benchmark%20for%20eco%2Dsensitive%20driving.\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://pressroom.toyota.com/driving-innovation-celebrating-25-years-of-the-toyota-prius/#:~:text=First%20Generation:%202001%20%E2%80%93%202003,benchmark%20for%20eco%2Dsensitive%20driving.\" target=\"_blank\">gas-electric hybrid was introduced in Toyota Prius</a>, the company has been improving, tweaking, and optimizing its Hybrid Synergy Drive, while many of its competitors—now to their disadvantage—bypassed the technology or deemed it of secondary importance.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_7a421f0d25d355e23028a748f048c9f2.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_7a421f0d25d355e23028a748f048c9f2.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_7a421f0d25d355e23028a748f048c9f2.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_7a421f0d25d355e23028a748f048c9f2.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_7a421f0d25d355e23028a748f048c9f2.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_7a421f0d25d355e23028a748f048c9f2.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_7a421f0d25d355e23028a748f048c9f2.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_7a421f0d25d355e23028a748f048c9f2.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_7a421f0d25d355e23028a748f048c9f2.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, the automaker’s policy of investing in the development of multiple propulsion pathways—such as plug-in hybrids, hydrogen, batteries, as well as internal combustion—enables Toyota to commercialize its models in a multitude of global markets and for different consumer groups.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Toyota’s <a href=\"https://dbrs.morningstar.com/research/463201/morningstar-dbrs-confirms-toyota-motor-corporation-at-aa-low-trend-remains-stable#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20Toyota%20benefits%20from%20its,and%20a%20conservative%20financial%20policy.\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://dbrs.morningstar.com/research/463201/morningstar-dbrs-confirms-toyota-motor-corporation-at-aa-low-trend-remains-stable#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20Toyota%20benefits%20from%20its,and%20a%20conservative%20financial%20policy.\" target=\"_blank\">strong financial position</a>, the result of generations of conservative management, provides ample resources for future investment in cutting-edge technologies such as solid-state batteries and self-driving, as well as consistent dividend payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Two major risk factors to this investment thesis must be mentioned: The first is new and formidable competition from the Chinese auto industry, which increasingly demonstrates its mettle with Western consumers in foreign markets as well as China and could enter the U.S. at some future date, despite the current tariff roadblock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, Toyota faces the same risk as any automaker, that negative economic conditions will dampen demand for vehicles, thus undermining the growth of revenue and profit.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Toyota ADRs remain a buy in my judgment.</p>",

When I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4453654-airbnb-stock-outlook-post-pandemic-era\">first turned bullish</a> on Airbnb, Inc. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB\" title=\"Airbnb, Inc.\">ABNB</a></span>) in September 2021, I was banking on the post-pandemic travel boom to drive revenue and earnings<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> growth higher. Although this expectation has indeed materialized, in hindsight, it is evident that Mr. Market had already priced this into the company's valuation. Since my first buy call, ABNB stock is down ~21%, which is not a pleasant sight given how the S&amp;P 500 has delivered stellar returns during the same period. I, of course, invested in ABNB as the stock retreated so my cost is around $125 per share today, and I am hardly at the breakeven point today.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With Airbnb expected to release Q3 earnings on November 6, exactly from a week from this writing, I wanted to take a step back to evaluate why the stock has gone nowhere for several years despite robust earnings growth (from a loss of $352 million in 2021, Airbnb has come a long way to report a profit of $2.63 billion in the past 12 months). What I found was that I had been too early to bet on the company's diversification efforts. In many of my follow-up articles since the initial buy call, which you can find <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4633861-airbnb-maintaining-my-bullish-stance-in-the-face-of-new-challenges\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4647093-airbnb-short-term-peak-in-demand-in\">here</a>, I discussed why I thought Airbnb's growth would accelerate as the company expands into ancillary services similar to how Booking Holdings Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BKNG\" title=\"Booking Holdings Inc.\">BKNG</a>) did. This is what I got wrong in the past 4+ years. Airbnb could never execute this strategy to perfection, and what we saw was a deceleration in revenue growth, which spooked Mr. Market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Exhibit 1: Airbnb annual revenue growth</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1986\" data-height=\"790\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Airbnb annual revenue growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"255\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While growth decelerated, Airbnb shifted its focus to improving profitability. This is not a bad outcome, of course, but the market was not willing to reward Airbnb with premium valuation multiples while growth moderated, rightly so. Sooner rather than later, you want high-growth companies to turn profitable but not at the cost of growth. Airbnb has turned into a cash flow machine (TTM FCF of $4.28 billion). Some of these cash flows have been used to return capital to shareholders as well (TTM stock repurchases worth $3.7 billion).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are all signs of a business that is growing profitably, but without an acceleration in revenue growth, I believe ABNB stock will trade sideways for the foreseeable future. This is why, in my opinion, the upcoming Q3 report will be a pivotal moment for ABNB as the management is expected to reveal the progress of the Airbnb Services business that was launched last May along with the redesign of the Experiences platform, provide new numbers to evaluate the growth in expansion markets, and also give color on the progress of integrating hotel booking into the Airbnb app.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Look Beyond Just Headline Numbers To Assess Airbnb's Growth Potential</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Airbnb is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly\">expected to report</a> $2.32 in EPS for Q3 on revenue of $4.08 billion. The company has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB/earnings/eps-surprise-summary?period=quarterly\">topped analyst expectations</a> for EPS on each of the past 3 quarters, but as illustrated below, the magnitude of these surprises has been well below the average seen in 2022 and 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Exhibit 2: Airbnb earnings surprise history</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1956\" data-height=\"878\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Airbnb earnings surprise history\" width=\"640\" height=\"287\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although an earnings surprise (or the lack of it) could indeed move ABNB stock in post-earnings trading, as a long-term-oriented investor, I am more interested in deciphering whether Airbnb's growth is likely to accelerate in the foreseeable future or remain under pressure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, a reacceleration in growth hinges on three important factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the short to medium term, whether we see an acceleration of revenue growth will be largely determined by the success of Airbnb's international expansion plans. In Q2, the management revealed that Airbnb's expansion markets (the likes of Japan and Brazil) are seeing much faster growth in nights booked compared to its core markets (U.S., UK, Canada, etc.). Commenting on the <a href=\"https://s26.q4cdn.com/656283129/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Airbnb_Q2-2025-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">fast growth observed in expansion markets</a>, CEO Brian Chesky wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>For six consecutive quarters, nights booked on an origin basis in our expansion markets have grown at about twice the rate of our core markets. This sustained growth is a result of our focus on achieving product-market fit, increasing brand awareness, and driving traffic in key countries.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Later in the shareholder letter, CEO Chesky revealed that both demand and supply in expansion markets grew at more than double the pace at which they grew in core markets in Q2. When Airbnb reports Q3 earnings next week, I will be paying close attention to these metrics to see if this trend continues in the third quarter as well. Given that Airbnb's core markets are seeing a moderation in growth, expansion markets hold the key to driving overall profitability and revenue growth higher in the next 4-6 quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Airbnb's focus on expansion markets seems timely given that industry experts project these markets to grow at a faster clip than well-established core markets. Boston Consulting Group <a href=\"https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/the-15-trillion-opportunity-in-leisure-travel\" rel=\"nofollow\">expects to see the biggest gains</a> in countries such as China, India, and Vietnam in the next 12 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Exhibit 3: Leisure trip destinations booked in the past 12 months and expectations for growth</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://web-assets.bcg.com/dims4/default/9befc52/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2998+0+0/resize/768x640!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fboston-consulting-group-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2F78%2F637a79584b15af2e00cd5fbb8c6a%2Ftraveler-of-the-future-ex02.png\" alt=\"Leisure trip destinations booked in the past 12 months and expectations for growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Boston Consulting Group</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As long as we are seeing continued growth in nights booked in expansion markets, I would be comfortable with my ABNB investment as I believe this would buy the company sufficient time to invest in two other growth engines—hotels and services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When we expand our timeline from the next 4 quarters to the next 2 years, I believe the most important growth driver will be Airbnb's hotel push. Back in 2019, <a href=\"https://news.airbnb.com/hoteltonight-and-airbnb-finalize-acquisition/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Airbnb acquired HotelTonight</a> to expand into the hotel booking sector. However, until recently, we did not see an aggressive push by the company to take market share from industry leaders in this space. That is changing now. Airbnb is now planning to add a new hotel interface into its app, finally delivering on its 2019 promise to directly compete with industry leaders in this space such as Booking.com. Speaking at the Skift Global Forum last month, <a href=\"https://www.phocuswire.com/brian-chesky-hotel-interface-airbnb\" rel=\"nofollow\">CEO Chesky said</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The concrete thing is we are now getting serious about hotels. We bought HotelTonight. We always had intended to integrate it into Airbnb. Then the pandemic hit, and similar to Experiences, we put everything on hold.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Commenting further on this upcoming hotel integration, CEO Chesky confirmed that the company is planning to give travelers the option to book a wide variety of hotel options within the Airbnb app, including boutique hotels, star-class hotel chains, and independent hotels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The hotel booking market adds a massive new opportunity for Airbnb. According to Bernstein analysts, the hotel booking market is <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/deep-dive-on-the-hotel-opportunity-for-airbnb-4229398\" rel=\"nofollow\">approximately 9 times bigger</a> than the short-term rentals market. CEO Chesky has already discussed how travelers use different apps to book hotels when they can't find something suitable on Airbnb, so the company is setting up the stage to keep these travelers within their ecosystem by integrating hotel booking into the app. I believe this will be one of the biggest revenue growth drivers in the next 2 years. For this reason, when Airbnb reports Q3 earnings, I will be paying close attention to management commentary about how these integration plans are moving forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the long term (think of 3+years), the services segment could turn out to be a massive growth driver for Airbnb if the expansion strategy is executed to perfection. Airbnb's goal is to set up the services business as a standalone unit where a traveler does not necessarily have to book an Airbnb stay to avail these services. Last May, the company <a href=\"https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-2025-summer-release/\" rel=\"nofollow\">launched 10 different categories</a> of services including chefs, photography, and spa treatments. In Q3 commentary, the management is likely to discuss the initial market response to these services. During the Q2 earnings call, the management revealed some promising numbers such as a 4.9-star rating for new offerings but the services business had just launched back then. Maintaining a similar level of positive ratings during Q3 should be considered a massive green flag for the future of this segment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am looking forward to Airbnb's Q3 earnings release as I believe management commentary (both in the shareholder letter and during the earnings call) will be full of interesting data points that paint a good picture of the company's growth potential. Without a reacceleration in revenue growth, I believe ABNB stock will continue to deliver lackluster returns as an expansion in valuation multiples cannot be expected just because the company is turning into a cash-flow machine. Given the valuation risks faced by the company, I am maintaining my neutral stance on ABNB ahead of the Q3 earnings print, but I may turn bullish even at these prices if the company gives me reason to be optimistic about the probability of an acceleration in growth in the next few quarters.</p>",

Things like this tend to please the market, which ends up being rewarded with re-ratings. This increase in recurring sales should soften the company's total sales because, as we will see below, the ratings segment can be somewhat cyclical.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are two main reasons for this, which we will look at in more detail later.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. The zero capacity for capital reinvestment on the Ratings side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. The acquisitions made in Analytics in recent years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2022, there was a significant increase in the Analytics segment, from 39% to 51% of sales. This is due to a major acquisition in this segment. On the capital allocation side we will see how they have done several of these in recent years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In any case, the 70% EBIT margin of MIS vs. 31% of MA (although also expanding) means that ratings represent 54% of sales but 70% of EBIT.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"886\" data-height=\"647\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Moody's Revenues\" width=\"640\" height=\"467\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author's representation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Moody's Investors Services (MIS)</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moody's ratings are divided into several types depending on the type of issuer, although corporate (company) bonds clearly predominate.

From 2021 to the end of 2022, you can see how each quarter they were getting less sales than in the previous quarter, the result of declines in issuance volumes due to the abrupt and massive rise in interest rates that was experienced in 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In general, debt tends to be issued in what are called \"issuance waves\", but every wave generates a subsequent undertow, which we will see in the \"refinancing wall\" part.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The good thing about credit ratings is that companies tend to use more than one rating provider for the same issue, so we can say that the services of Moody's and S&amp;P Global Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPGI\" title=\"S&amp;P Global Inc.\">SPGI</a>) are not mutually exclusive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The summary of this segment is that it is an oligopoly with 70% margins in a non-exclusive market.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Moody's Analytics (MA)</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moody's Analytics offers a wide range of risk-related data and analytical content, including credit research, quantitative credit ratings, economic research, business intelligence, know-your-customer tools, commercial real estate data, training services, ESG and risk management software for financial institutions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Debt investors are looking for analytics to understand risks such as credit and counterparty risk. Moody's offers tools that predict the probability of default and provide real-time ratings, as well as early warnings and historical data going back to the 1970s. All of this allows for accurate debt pricing and valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And in some cases, this credit data can have a history of up to 100 years, something irreplicable for any new competitor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In any case, this is a much more highly competitive segment, which we see tending to grow by acquisitions. Estimates here are less reliable, but we should continue to have a slight margin expansion while the company's percentage of recurring sales increases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last decline in the percentage of recurring sales was because the ratings segment (less recurring) grew by 33% last year, compared to 7.8% growth in Analytics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"819\" data-height=\"476\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Types of Revenues\" width=\"640\" height=\"372\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author's Representation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capital Allocation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moody's has made several acquisitions over the past two decades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To reduce the cyclicality of the ratings business, management decided in 2007-2008 to create Moody's Analytics, using data from the ratings business to build the subscription model mentioned above.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since then, they have expanded the scale and scope of this business through a series of acquisitions.

It already represents 4.5% of the company's sales, which seems to us a certainly high figure for something that is a priority and should have a CAPEX close to 0. They have been doing this for 3 years and when they return to more normal figures (3% of sales), it could be a good leap for FCF.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"886\" data-height=\"600\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ROIC and Reinvestment Rate\" width=\"640\" height=\"433\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author's Representation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These were Moody's results.

However, impeccable management of operating expenses has played a key role in this margin increase. They are up 1% vs. +11% in sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recurring revenues, which represent 96% of Moody's Analytics (MA) total revenues, grew by 11% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic and constant exchange rate basis. Transaction revenues declined 19%, reflecting MA's continued strategic shift to subscription-based solutions. The good news is that recurrence on the Ratings side is already 69% as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this data is very good overall, but I feel like talking about the Q3 results to link directly to the next section on risks, as I think they did a brilliant exposition of them in the call.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the stock now seems to be suffering from a possible AI risk on the Analytics side, we will see how that risk is quite unlikely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, large US banks are incorporating their models and data into internal AI-based workflows. In fact, they signed a $3 million-plus contract with a Tier 1 bank in the U.S., which will use their tools to automate credit reports and deploy early warning systems in real estate portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its AI strategy has several layers. The first is an internal platform that allows all employees to build AI agents to redesign processes and gain productivity. Added to this is their \"AI Studio Factory,\" focused on developing agentic products (basically, intelligent agents that use their own data and APIs).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I also don't see the risk of regulation as very likely. I mean, sure at some point it will be tried, but if they are doing better than in the 2008 crisis, it is not difficult and hopefully they have learned the lesson, their Ratings system is something that works well globally; I don't see the incentives or the way to change that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other major risk is, directly, already something almost impossible and would put an end to the thesis of gold and Bitcoin, a deleveraging and good economic and budgeting, globally. A utopia. Although a period like this was lived from WWII to 1970.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Half related to this, however, is the risk of the growth of private markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When a company uses the private credit market, it accesses financing through private loans, does not issue public bonds and, therefore, does not need a credit rating. In these cases, institutional investors conduct their own risk analysis without resorting to agencies such as Moody's. This means that, as the company's credit rating increases, it will be able to make its own risk analysis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This means that, as private credit gains ground, the volume of government debt requiring a rating decreases, potentially reducing Moody's core business. CEO Robert Fauber himself explained that the alliance with MSCI stems precisely from the need to offer an independent assessment of private credit risk. It seeks to add value from another angle: helping investors to understand and compare risk with a \"trusted third party\" view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although on the call they commented that they are starting to see some flow back from private credit into the public markets, mainly because coupons in the public market are significantly cheaper than private financing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While not an immediate threat, it is a gradual and sustained pressure on their traditional revenue model.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This valuation method effectively combines a sort of multiples-based valuation, the minimum required rates of return for the stock, and the total return shareholders can achieve in the form of dividends and share buybacks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using 2024 FCF as a starting point, I believe that both of Moody's segments can grow at high single-digit rates. The MIS segment is driven by refinancing wall volumes and annual price increases in the order of 4% and the MA segment, I believe, can have organic growths of 5% plus a few extra points inorganically. With the use of AI these companies are becoming much more efficient businesses with the ability to increase margins. So, I think FCF will be able to grow at rates of 12% in a base case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we assume an exit multiple of 30x and discount the future value at a minimum required internal rate of return of 12%, factoring in projected dividends and the estimated stock price in 2029, we calculate a fair value of $460 per share. This price would ensure achieving the minimum 12% return over the next 5 years if these assumptions hold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For all these reasons, I rate the stock as a hold, as it is currently trading at 490$.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"948\" data-height=\"193\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"130\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author's Representation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moody's strikes me as a fantastic business, which the market may be unfairly penalizing because of ill-founded fears around AI in its Moody's Analytics segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This could create buying opportunities in the company that could benefit long-term investors who understand the business well.

Joining me now to discuss the latest decision is Francis Fong, Senior Economist with TD Bank Group.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And Francis, what's your reaction to the decision? Any surprises here?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Francis Fong:</strong> Yeah, first of all, thanks for having me back, Anthony. Always great to be here. So no surprises in this decision. I think this was a widely expected rate cut. If we look at where the growth picture has come in, where the inflation data has come in, where the unemployment rate or the employment data has come in, a lot of it has pointed to additional space for the bank to lower rates and support that overall economy. We've seen quite a lot of weakness in areas like exports, investment, whereas we've seen maybe a bit of resilience on the consumer spending side, but enough so that the Bank could provide that additional cut. So yeah, no surprises there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Now, the big question is, does this latest cut mark the end of the Bank of Canada's easing cycle?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Francis Fong:</strong> Yeah, and I think this sort of follows where the economic profile is going to be in the next few quarters. We do anticipate that second-quarter growth, which was quite weak in a lot of key areas. We do expect that to be the bottom in growth. We're already seeing the kind of Q3 growth picture's come back a little bit, though perhaps not as strong as some would like. And so that should provide some basis for the Bank of Canada to remain on hold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I mean, at 2.25%, we're already talking about where the Bank of Canada sort of finds the neutral rate. And so I believe the bank is quite comfortable where they are. And they actually did communicate that, so long as the economy progresses how they envision it-- and so far, the data is of lining up with that-- this is likely where they're going to keep the floor. So they've already choreographed that well. So absent any kind of surprise on the downside or, in fact, the upside, this is likely where we're going to see rates for the medium term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> I think one area that there's a lot of uncertainty right now remains tariffs and the lack of a deal between the US and Canada. Now, big question-- what happens if we don't reach a deal, and what are the implications for monetary policy?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Francis Fong:</strong> That's a great question, Anthony. And I think this is obviously where there is quite a lot of uncertainty because if you read the headlines, and you read the headlines alone, it will give you the impression that things are in a very dire state. Obviously, we just sort of had a potential trade deal fall through, according to Prime Minister Carney. And so that kind of leaves a lot of folks with a lot of uncertainty. I think if you dig into the Bank of Canada's Monetary Policy Report and even in our own forecast, we do embed an actual tariff assumption in those forecasts. Bank of Canada, for example, has an average tariff rate of about 6%, as of their October Monetary Policy Report. That is a far cry from the big double-digit numbers that, for example, Trump is talking about and things of that nature. That's the actual one that we see.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But on the same token, that is not felt evenly across the country. That 6% is really a reflection of the much higher tariff rate we're seeing on steel and aluminum, on non-CUSMA compliant autos, softwood lumber, things of that nature. So we do see some higher sectoral impacts, whereas the actual average tariff rate is quite modest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So what that means is there's still going to be uncertainty going forward because that 6% tariff rate is being felt in some parts of the economy. So we're still hoping for that deal to sort of remove that sort of uncertainty. But if no trade deal takes place, we're sort of where we are today, which is sort of a major headwind. But we're still seeing some resilience behind the scenes in areas that are not so hard hit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Alright, now, we also have the upcoming federal budget soon. What are your thoughts on that? And what implications, if any, will that have on Bank of Canada policy going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Francis Fong:</strong> So I mentioned the neutral rate a little bit earlier. I think that's really where we're going to see the impact of where the Bank of Canada thinks the Canadian economy is going to be long term because all the conversations around the federal budget, everything that Mark Carney is talking about right now, is around, how do we reorient the Canadian economy away from a trading partner, a primary trading partner, that is perhaps less reliable than it has been in the past.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> So how do we create those new trade routes in between the country or within the country and, of course, across the Pacific and across the Atlantic? That requires huge investments in everything from trade infrastructure, transportation infrastructure, making our firms more competitive in those markets that previously we haven't really had to compete in up until now. So what does that picture look like?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Francis Fong:</strong> So where we're looking for more clarity and more guidance is what are those investments that we're going to make. Obviously, we're already hearing things about major projects and things of that nature. But beyond that, how are we establishing ourselves in those markets, and will it work? And of course, that has implications for what the trend rate of the overnight rate will look like. And so there's implications there. But in the short term, it's likely not going to have too, too much of an impact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Alright, so given this latest decision, how do you expect the loonie to perform going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Francis Fong:</strong> So I think the narrative around loonie has been difficult to parse. Up to or sort of over the last year, we've really seen the Canadian dollar be part of this broader narrative around US dollar weakness across many of its trading partners. And that's driven a lot of the dynamics over the last year or so. Lately, I think we've seen more divergence among advanced economies relative to the US dollar, where it's short-rate differentials. So given that the Canadian economy has performed, I think, relatively weaker than a lot of our advanced counterparts, and that's obviously, especially true given our reliance on the US, there's been some more pronounced weakness relative to some others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But we do anticipate that, as the economic profile improves over time, and we start to see that growth picture get a little better, we're already seeing some upside surprises on the employment side, on the inflation side. All of that, I think, will contribute to some US-- sorry, some Canadian dollar strengthening. And we do anticipate it to strengthen from here to about $0.75, sort of towards late next year and through our medium-term forecast horizon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Now, you talked about inflation. You talked about jobs. Are there any things, key reports that you'll be watching closely to get a sense of how the Canadian economy will perform over the longer term?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Francis Fong:</strong> I mean, there's-- that's a complicated question. There's a lot of data we're looking at. Obviously, growth, inflation, and employment, the obvious ones that we'll be keeping an eye on because there's been quite a bit of volatility, driven, no doubt, by the uncertainty that firms and individuals are facing. But on top of that, we're really going to be looking at the political side, what's coming out of this budget, how does that set us up long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And we're going to be looking at a lot of individual components of GDP. For example, how does the trade picture improve? We saw a massive decline in real exports, particular, 32% annualized reduction in real goods exports. How does that trade picture improve? All of that, I think, contributes to how is the Canadian economy staying resilient in the face of this new threat, and how do we evolve going forward, so lots of data that we're keeping an eye on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Francis, thanks for your time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Francis Fong:</strong> Always a pleasure, Anthony. </p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.moneytalkgo.com/video/bank-of-canada-cuts-rate-to-2-25-in-second-straight-drop/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p>",

With a market capitalization of $6.19 billion as of this writing, and a good track record for growth under<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> its belt, it is certainly an intriguing prospect. On top of this, shares of the business trade on the cheap, and leverage is lower than what we see with most other similar enterprises. Currently, the housing market is undergoing significant stress. And that is something that investors should continue to monitor closely. This is especially true when you consider that firms such as this are finally starting to see some pain from that weakness. But given how cheap shares are, because of its overall financial position, and because my expectation that the long-term picture for the housing industry will eventually improve, I believe that now is actually a great time to upgrade the company from a \"Buy\" to a \"Strong Buy.\"</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Great Play In Housing</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fundamentally speaking, things are not going exactly great for shareholders of Taylor Morrison Home Corporation.

In the image above, you can see how the median price of a new home sold has been on the decline for a few years now. This is because of inflationary pressures and high-interest rates aimed at combating them. Unfortunately, because of the government shutdown, we don't have the most up-to-date data here. But <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/current/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/current/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">we do know</a> that, as of August, of this year, the number of housing completions was 8.4% lower than it was a year earlier. The number of housing starts was down 6%, while building permits were down 11.1%. As I have written about in other articles, such as here and here, I firmly believe that the U.S. economy is barreling toward a recession.

That's down from the $2.12 billion that the company reported a year earlier. This was driven by a decline in the number of homes closed from 3,394 to 3,324, which more than offset a rise in the average price of a home from $598,000 last year to $602,000 this year. However, for the first nine months of this year in its entirety, the number of homes closed was up, while the average price was down slightly. The chart above illustrates this. And that, clearly, helped to push revenue for the first nine months of this year up compared to the same time last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This recent decrease in sales had a deleterious impact on the company's bottom line. Net income contracted from $251.1 million to $201.4 million. But that's not all. While operating cash flow did skyrocket from $135.9 million to $219.6 million, we saw this metric, adjusted for changes in working capital, fall from $264.7 million to $257 million. Meanwhile, EBITDA for the company contracted from $379.2 million to $333.1 million. Although net profits are down for this year in its entirety, all other cash flow metrics for the company have improved, which means that the problems seen in the most recent quarter are new. In fact, management, while acknowledging broader economic conditions that have delayed the purchase of homes, mentioned that the company has been offering even greater incentives and discounts to drive buying activity.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2014\" data-height=\"872\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"277\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"277\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1894\" data-height=\"900\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"304\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"304\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These discounts have been reflected in net new orders for the institution. In the most recent quarter, the company saw net new orders amounting to 2,468 homes. That's down 12.8% from the 2,830 homes ordered a year earlier. At the same time as this occurred, the average price of a home ordered contracted from $587,000 to $567,000. Unlike what we saw in revenue, this is not a new trend. In fact, as the chart above illustrates, net new orders and average prices for new homes ordered have both contracted year over year for the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same time of 2024. The company is also seeing a rise in its cancellation rate, with an increase from 9.3% in the third quarter of last year to 15.4% this year. This is evidence that the buyers of its homes are becoming increasingly pressured by difficult market conditions.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2058\" data-height=\"886\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"276\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"276\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the chart above, you can see the impact that prior large home deliveries, and weaker net new orders, have had on the company's backlog. The number of homes in its backlog came in at only 3,605 homes in the third quarter of this year. That's an astounding decline of 36.7% compared to the 5,692 homes in backlog a year earlier. And at the same time, as the company has pushed out more of the higher-priced homes and brought in more of the lower-priced ones, the average price of a home in backlog dropped from $673,000 to $648,000.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1776\" data-height=\"870\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trading Multiples\" width=\"640\" height=\"314\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"314\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080512565327_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This makes it difficult to know what the future holds. If we do project out based on the results that we have seen already for this year, we would get net profits of about $838.6 million, adjusted operating cash flow of $1.09 billion, and EBITDA of $1.40 billion. With these estimates, we can see in the chart above how shares of the company are currently valued. Obviously, this does not capture the prospect of additional weakening in the market. But considering how cheap the stock is, even with the picture worsening, shares could still be quite appealing. This is true not only on an absolute basis, but relative to other similar firms as well. In the table below, I stacked Taylor Morrison Home Corporation up against five other similar enterprises. On a price-to-earnings basis, two of the firms are cheaper than it is, while another is tied with it. But when it comes to the other two valuation approaches, our prospect is the cheapest of the group.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><strong>Company</strong></td> <td><strong>Price / Earnings</strong></td> <td><strong>Price / Operating Cash Flow</strong></td> <td><strong>EV / EBITDA</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Taylor Morrison Home Corporation</strong></td> <td><strong>7.4</strong></td> <td><strong>5.7</strong></td> <td><strong>5.7</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Hovnanian Enterprises (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HOV\" title=\"Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc.\">HOV</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>6.3</strong></td> <td><strong>6.4</strong></td> <td><strong>8.1</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Meritage Homes (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTH\" title=\"Meritage Homes Corporation\">MTH</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>6.2</strong></td> <td><strong>19.1</strong></td> <td><strong>7.5</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Century Communities (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCS\" title=\"Century Communities, Inc.\">CCS</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>7.4</strong></td> <td><strong>13.1</strong></td> <td><strong>11.9</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Beazer Homes USA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BZH\" title=\"Beazer Homes USA, Inc.\">BZH</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>10.7</strong></td> <td><strong>25.9</strong></td> <td><strong>20.1</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>KB Home (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KBH\" title=\"KB Home\">KBH</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>8.8</strong></td> <td><strong>11.4</strong></td> <td><strong>8.5</strong></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another advantage that Taylor Morrison Home Corporation has over most of its competitors is leverage. The firm has net debt of only $1.82 billion right now. In the chart below, you can see that this translates to a net leverage ratio of 1.30. That's below four of the five institutions that I stacked it up against. In fact, I would argue that it is substantially lower than these other four players. That provides the company additional flexibility and optionality, especially in a down market. So I don't have any concern about the long-term viability of the business.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1910\" data-height=\"904\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Net Debt / EBITDA\" width=\"640\" height=\"303\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"303\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the short run, I do remain concerned about market conditions. According to one <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500367-ubs-u-s-lumber-tariffs-could-add-8900-to-cost-of-building-a-home\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500367-ubs-u-s-lumber-tariffs-could-add-8900-to-cost-of-building-a-home\" target=\"_blank\">source</a>, the newest tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration will raise the cost of the average home by $8,900. And that does not even factor in any potential ramifications from the newest 10% tariff imposed on Canada by the U<span>nited States</span>. Considering that Canada <a href=\"https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/2025/01/us-lumber-market-trump-administration/#:~:text=Compared%20to%20the%2028.1%20million,growing%20and%20conserving%20our%20forests.%E2%80%9D\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/2025/01/us-lumber-market-trump-administration/#:~:text=Compared%20to%20the%2028.1%20million,growing%20and%20conserving%20our%20forests.%E2%80%9D\" target=\"_blank\">supplies</a> about 24% of US softwood lumber consumption for the United States, and that this works out to as much as 85% of all U.S. softwood lumber imports, we could have additional costs stemming from this decision. But the good news is that, earlier this year, <strong>Zillow</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/Z\" title=\"Zillow Group, Inc.\">Z</a>) <a href=\"https://nationalmortgageprofessional.com/news/us-housing-shortage-hits-record-high-analysis\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://nationalmortgageprofessional.com/news/us-housing-shortage-hits-record-high-analysis\" target=\"_blank\">estimated</a> that there exists a housing deficit of 4.7 million homes nationwide. This is actually a record high despite a five-year construction boom.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For several years now, the U<span>nited States</span> has been underbuilding. So even with a surge of construction activity, the preexisting shortage and a continued growth of the U.S. population caused this shortage to balloon. At some point, the combination of additional population growth and some of the 8.1 million families that are now sharing homes with non-relatives, will eventually hit a breaking point and push buying activity up, but perhaps only after a recession and a big decline in interest rates. When that does happen, Taylor Morrison Home Corporation will be in a prime position to benefit.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on all the data currently available, I still believe that while market conditions could worsen in the near term, Taylor Morrison Home Corporation is in a good spot. The firm is cheap, and the overall risk profile of it is low. When you consider long-term trends, this bodes well for shareholders. So at the end of the day, I firmly believe that increasing my rating from a \"Buy\" to a \"Strong Buy\" makes sense.</p>",

This followed the divestment of non-core business activities in the years before. Ever since, shares have lost about 30% in the time<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> frame of a quarter, while the market at large has been trading fairly stable.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This has certainly improved appeal, as the company announced an interesting acquisition as well. Right now, valuations have been compressed quite a bit, but still mark a substantial premium to the overall market, although that I am inclined to buy the dip below the $200 mark.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data Analytics Play</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Verisk is a provider of key data analytics functions in the global insurance industry, which in itself includes various segments like life &amp; annuity, auto, property, casualty, weather events, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its role is that of strategic data analytics and technology partner in order to provide insights to its client base, which use such data for underwriting and claims. These insights allow them to make more informed decisions, which is key given the amounts involved with such underwriting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Verisk generates about $3 billion in sales from providing such services with EBITDA margins exceeding 50% of sales, an impressive result for a completely focused business with retention rates close to 100%. Some 70% of its sales are generated by underwriting solutions, with the remainder of revenues coming from claim solutions. In all, some 80% of sales are generated in North America, with the remainder of revenues generated abroad.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Becoming A Focused Business</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Up to a couple of years ago, the company has a smaller energy segment and financial service industry activity as well, yet it has divested these assets in recent years. The completely focused business posted a 7% increase in sales, both in 2023 and 2024, with revenues last year reported up to nearly $2.9 billion. The company reported EBITDA near $1.6 billion, translating into truly remarkable margins, with adjusted earnings reported at $6.64 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the year 2025, the company initially saw sales up to a midpoint of $3.05 billion, with adjusted earnings seen a couple pennies short of the $7 per share mark. Trading at $303 in July, as the company was awarded a $45 billion enterprise valuation, equal to 15 times sales, valuing equity at a mid-forty times earnings multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That was not about to change following a $162 million bolt-on deal announced for SuranceBay over the summer, and while the performance of the business was impressive, an earnings yield in the low 2s was simply too low to see appeal.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Coming Down</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the summer, share of Verisk have seen quite a setback, now trading down 20% to $208 per share, levels first seen in the summer of 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fall started by the end of July, when the company announced both second quarter <a href=\"https://investor.verisk.com/News--Events-/Press-Releases--Market-Info/news-details/2025/Verisk-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">results</a>, and announced a substantial acquisition. Second quarter sales were up 8% in a steady fashion to $773 million. The company hiked the midpoint of the sales guidance to $3.11 billion, aided by a weaker dollar, but at the same time trimmed the full year earnings guidance by five cents to a midpoint of $6.90 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net debt stood at $2.6 billion as 140 million shares outstanding make for a $34.0 billion equity valuation and $36.6 billion enterprise valuation. This reduces sales multiples to about 12 times, with earnings trading at a 35 times multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, Verisk announced a substantial $2.35 billion <a href=\"https://s29.q4cdn.com/767340216/files/doc_presentations/2025/Sep/Verisk-Announces-the-Acquisitions-of-AccuLynx-and-SuranceBay.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">purchase</a> of AccuLynx, with the company being a leading SAAS platform which provides end-to-end management workflows for residential property contractors. The company really focuses on all information in such projects, while providing key links between insurers, contractors, suppliers and third party administrators.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The purchase does not come cheap. The company, which has been founded in 2018, generates about $150 million in annual sales. This suggests that a premium 15 times sales multiple has been paid, although that its sales are seen up mid-to double-digits. The 55% EBITDA margins are in line with margins reported by Verisk itself. This will double net debt essentially to $5 billion, still manageable, for a net leverage ratio in the mid to-higher 2s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors gotten a bit spooked as shares fell by another 10% towards the end of October, when Verisk <a href=\"https://investor.verisk.com/News--Events-/Press-Releases--Market-Info/news-details/2025/Verisk-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> a ¨mere¨ 5.5% increase in organic constant currency sales for the third quarter. Worse, slower growth came amidst margin pressure as well, with adjusted earnings up just 3% to $1.72 per share. While the company maintains its full year $6.80-$7.00 adjusted earnings per share outlook, the full year sales outlook has been trimmed by $40-$50 million here, trending closer to the original outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This continued fall in the share price made that earnings multiples compressed further to 30 times, which is a lot more compelling than this summer, but still rather demanding.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">And Now?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the deal for AccuLynx taking place at a substantial premium, it is easy to become a bit more cautious, also as organic growth is slowing down. High valuations and a subsequent 30% pullback have reduced earnings multiples from the mid-forties to thirty times. This has pushed up the earnings yield from a low 2% to the low 3s%, which is compelling, but still demanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Verisk is a very strong business, one which I have great admiration for, as the move has certainly improved appeal a great deal. The question is if current multiples in the low-thirties are compelling enough, now also given the leveraged up balance sheet, as frankly I need a bigger margin of safety here.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, I am watching this development unfold with great interest, looking to get involved at levels towards below $200 mark. I fully recognize the risk that I might not see such levels as the market rightfully awards premium multiple to a premium business for a long time already, with the risk-reward gradually becoming more balanced here.</p>",
