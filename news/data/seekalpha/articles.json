The most striking takeaway from these meetings was regional resilience. The macro stress of the past has eased faster than expected, and what is emerging in its place is a more normalized but also differentiated investment landscape, one where politics, demographics, and selection matter more than headline inflation alone. Against this backdrop, we see the most compelling opportunities in companies aligned with long-term structural themes, including defense spending and investment-led growth.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">From Stress to Normalization</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) has moved past the acute macro stress of the last two years. Inflation shocks, aggressive tightening, and crisis-driven uncertainty have eased faster than expected in several markets. Disinflation in energy and food prices, combined with early signs of labor market cooling, has reduced pressure on households and policymakers alike. Central banks across the region remain cautious but the direction of travel has shifted from restrictive toward more accommodative, creating room for gradual easing through 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CEE economies such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Romania are growing steadily supported by an exceptionally strong labor market. Labor shortages remain a structural feature across Europe, estimated at roughly 15–17% in many countries.<sup>1</sup> This scarcity anchors wage growth, limits the risk of sharp cyclical downturns, and supports continued growth in domestic consumption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While disinflation has stabilized household balance sheets, a broad-based recovery in consumer demand has not yet fully materialized. Savings rates remain elevated, housing activity subdued, and discretionary spending cautious.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Importantly, this caution appears cyclical rather than structural. As real incomes continue to recover and monetary policy shifts gradually toward easing, we believe the region is approaching an inflection point. The next leg of growth will be increasingly consumption-led, as improving economic conditions restore confidence and unlock pent-up demand.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Politics Sets the Ceiling</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While macro stabilization has reduced downside risks across the region, political dynamics are increasingly shaping investment outcomes and relative performance across equity markets. In Poland, institutional friction between the presidency and parliament has slowed policy execution. In Hungary, the April 2026 parliamentary election dominates the short-term outlook as uncertainty over EU relations reinforces a wait-and-see posture among investors and corporates. In Turkey, despite a credible disinflation path, recurring political noise has underscored how fragile confidence remains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Across the region, the message was consistent: stabilization helps, but politics sets the ceiling for valuation. Fiscal deficits remain elevated across parts of the region, but markets are increasingly discerning, rewarding countries where deficits fund productive investment while penalizing weaker fiscal discipline.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Defense Spending as a Structural Anchor</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Defense spending has become the clearest expression of policy pragmatism across the region given current geopolitical tensions and elevated security risks from the Russia-Ukraine war. After decades of underinvestment, European and NATO defense markets are now undergoing a structural reset — with ammunition and land systems among the most capacity-constrained and strategically critical segments.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Defense Spending as a Share of GDP in Selected Countries</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/27f4ffc2e0624943bd5036f0f0919fdb/6886_navigating-emerging-europe_chart-1_2026-02_v1_desktop.svg\" alt=\"Defense Spending as a Share of GDP in Selected Countries\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: NATO, as of June 3, 2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NATO commitments and EU-level financing make defense spending sustainable and long-dated. Importantly, this investment extends well beyond military procurement. It is supporting domestic manufacturing, logistics capabilities, rail, ports, and broader infrastructure, creating a spillover effect across multiple industries. Unlike cyclical stimulus, defense investment offers multi-year visibility and reinforces domestic industrial capacity, making it one of the most durable capital-allocation themes in the region.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Poland: The Star of CEE</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among all countries visited, Poland stood out as the region’s structural outperformer. The country continues to benefit from substantial EU funding, elevated defense spending, and a robust infrastructure pipeline. 2026 is shaping up to be a pivotal year, with Recovery and Resilience Facility inflows expected to more than triple versus 2025, alongside rising absorption of cohesion funds and low-interest loans for defense investments from the EU.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Poland EU Fund Inflows</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/4854c33db6d14c96a99d2b87e02a3815/6886_navigating-emerging-europe_chart-2_2026-02_v1_desktop.svg\" alt=\"Poland EU Fund Inflows\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Schuman Associates, as of December 2024.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Poland is also benefiting from a strong labor market that has improved wage growth and household income. Given the tight labor market and monetary easing, we believe household consumption is poised to reaccelerate as easing policy and sustained wage growth restore confidence.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Central Asia: A Different Growth Engine</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An unexpected, but increasingly important, theme that emerged during meetings on the ground was growth in Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. These economies are sustaining 5–7% real GDP growth, driven by young demographics, urbanization, rising productivity, and increasing domestic investment. Financial penetration remains low, creating long runways for credit growth. <em>Kaspi<sup>*</sup></em>, Kazakhstan’s leading super app, continues to drive the formalization of payments, e-commerce penetration, and financial inclusion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Uzbekistan is at an earlier stage in its economic development but that is precisely what makes it compelling. The country has been moving away from a closed economy towards a more open one, introducing new regulations to develop its capital market and attract investment. Rising investor interest reflects the government’s privatization drive and its objective of lifting GDP from $150 billion today to above $200 billion by 2030. Foreign companies are seeking to actively expand in the country, drawn to its high growth profile and regional champions are already positioning for this next phase of growth. Large banks such as <em>OTP Bank<sup>*</sup></em> are expanding in Uzbekistan, seeking to capture structurally higher credit growth than is available in slower-growing European markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taken together, Central Asia provides a complementary growth engine to Emerging Europe: less constrained by demographics, earlier in its financial development, and offering the kind of structural growth that defined emerging markets in earlier decades. For investors willing to look beyond traditional regional buckets, the opportunity set is both familiar and increasingly investable.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Selective Exposure Across Emerging Europe and Central Asia</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Across the region, our <strong><a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/emerging-markets-fund-gbfax\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener\" title=\"GBFAX - Emerging Markets Fund - Class A - Overview\">VanEck Emerging Markets Fund</a></strong> remains selective. <em>OTP Bank<sup>*</sup></em>, Hungary’s largest commercial bank is likely to benefit from a pickup in corporate lending in 2026. We believe the bank could deliver strong lending growth with decent net interest margins across all its addressable markets. The bank also has ambitions to strengthen its presence in Uzbekistan after acquiring a majority stake in one of the country’s top lenders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>PKO Bank Polska<sup>*</sup></em> is likely to benefit from accelerating loan growth as EU-funded projects transition to bank-financed investment. Similarly, <em>InPost<sup>*</sup></em> with its comprehensive business logistics and consumer focused services is poised to benefit from industrial and discretionary consumption trends in Poland and broader EU region. In contrast to the companies benefitting from macro trends, <em>Diagnostyka<sup>*</sup></em> provides healthcare exposure to Poland’s underpenetrated medical diagnostics industry that is benefiting from industry consolidation and rising demand for diagnostic services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We believe <em>MLP Sağlık<sup>*</sup></em>, the largest hospital group in Turkey could deliver strong earnings growth. The company is well positioned to benefit from consolidation in the industry and enjoys significant pricing power that boosts its profit margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of Georgia’s largest banks,<em> Bank of Georgia<sup>*</sup></em> with over 40% market share offers scale and operating leverage. We believe the company will continue to grow its Armenian operations, benefitting from Armenia’s lower banking penetration and rapid loan growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also believe Greek banks, <em>Piraeus Bank<sup>*</sup> and Eurobank<sup>*</sup></em> will benefit from strong loan growth in 2026 and beyond supported by private consumption and a multi-year investment cycle tied to EU fund inflows. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positioning for Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our meetings reinforced the view that with the macro reset largely behind us, the Emerging Europe opportunity now lies more in active selection. Investment-led themes including defense, EU-funded infrastructure, financial deepening, and consumption recovery offer the clearest visibility. Politics and institutions will continue to drive dispersion, but for investors willing to be selective, the opportunity set is compelling. In Emerging Europe, durability and execution matter more than narrative, and that is where we see the strongest potential for returns. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Disclosures</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><sup>1</sup> Source: Reuters</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><sup>*</sup>Portfolio weights as of 1/31/2026, PKO Bank Polska: 0.52%, InPost SA 0.98%, Diagnostyka 0.54%, Kaspi 1.29%, OTP Bank 1.43%; MLP Saglik 1.62%, Bank of Georgia 1.81%, Piraeus Bank 1.28%, EuroBank 1.12%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All indices listed are unmanaged indices and include the reinvestment of all dividends, but do not reflect the payment of transaction costs, advisory fees or expenses that are associated with an investment in the Fund.

A series of geopolitical flare-ups across multiple regions has<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> strained alliances, raised military tensions, and reintroduced trade and policy uncertainty. The recent expansion of the U.S. military presence in the Middle East has intensified concerns about the potential for a direct confrontation with Iran, should ongoing negotiations fail. Any escalation, particularly one affecting oil supply routes or leading to a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, would carry meaningful implications for both energy and global financial markets.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet despite the rise in geopolitical volatility, markets have not experienced a major pullback. This resilience echoes the market’s behavior during 2025’s disruptive trade environment, highlighting investors’ ability to remain focused on solid economic fundamentals rather than on headline noise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, the rapidly shifting geopolitical environment adds another layer of complexity for investors. With uncertainty proving persistent, maintaining discipline and a long-term perspective remains essential in navigating the evolving global landscape.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How equity markets react to geopolitical events</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the unpredictable nature of geopolitical events, forecasting their short- or long-term outcomes is inherently difficult. While fear of uncertainty can drive investor behavior, history shows that equity market reactions in response to geopolitical shocks are generally brief. The exception occurs when such events materially affect economic fundamentals, central bank actions, or coincide with periods of broader macro weakness.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One example is the 1973 oil embargo, which forced the Federal Reserve (Fed)—already grappling with persistent inflation since the mid-1960s and fiscal strain following the Vietnam War—to sharply raise rates to counter oil-driven price pressures. This drove bond yields higher, slowed the U.S. economy, and weighed heavily on equities until the fall of 1974. Equities did not find a bottom until a steep rate-cutting cycle in 1974-75 revived economic activity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More recently, the Russia-Ukraine conflict in February of 2022 compounded an already challenging macro backdrop. Post-COVID supply shocks had driven inflation higher globally, and Russia’s invasion triggered a surge in energy prices, adding further inflationary pressures. Ultimately, major global central banks, including the Fed, tightened policy, and economic conditions slowed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By contrast, Russia’s annexation of Crimea nearly a decade earlier had a limited market impact. Energy prices did not surge, allowing financial conditions to remain stable. There was no central bank intervention; the Fed remained in an extended period of zero interest rate policy, and the European Central Bank kept its accommodative stance. This backdrop of easy monetary conditions helped support economic activity, enabling the stock market to reach all-time highs despite geopolitical uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, markets typically stay anchored to fundamentals, which generally outweigh short-term uncertainty unless geopolitics disrupts them.</p> <p

Source: Bloomberg, Principal Asset Management. Data as of February 23, 2025.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The global AI race and its role in geopolitics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The global AI arms race is one channel through which geopolitics could influence economic and corporate fundamentals. The tech rivalry between the U.S. and China—and other major AI players—is likely to spark geopolitical flare-ups in the near future, as the importance of achieving AI dominance aligns with securing economic strength, military power, and global influence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this quest for dominance, reliable access to the resource-intensive AI supply chain (e.g., minerals, energy, semiconductors, infrastructure, talent, capital) is imperative. No country controls the entire AI supply chain. Instead, the supply chain functions as a global network, with various regions specializing in different key AI inputs. This interdependence leaves AI advancement in any given country largely reliant on cross-border collaboration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Against this backdrop, disrupting or constraining the export of a critical input to slow a region’s AI advancement has become a powerful geopolitical weapon, evident in recent policy actions from the U.S. and China.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The U.S. strategy to constrain China’s AI capabilities</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the U.S. has maintained its position as the leading global power, China has rapidly advanced its tech capabilities and demonstrated an ability to innovate, not just to replicate. Notably, China’s ability to deliver high-quality goods at lower cost across various industries, including tech, has prompted the U.S. to respond with policies aimed at slowing China’s AI advancement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Commanding about 50% of the global semiconductor market, the U.S. has leveraged this strength against China, whose reliance on Western rivals for advanced hardware remains a key vulnerability. Since the Biden administration, the U.S. has imposed—and continually revised—export restrictions on advanced semiconductors, a policy that evolves as geopolitical conditions shift and the “America first” drive to maintain tech dominance intensifies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond its own restrictions, U.S. policymakers have pressured allies to block China’s potential efforts to bypass U.S. export controls. For several years, the U.S. has pressured the Dutch government to bar ASML (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASML\" title=\"ASML Holding N.V.\">ASML</a>)—which dominates the global market for extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, critical for manufacturing the highest-performing chips that power modern technologies—from exporting advanced chipmaking tools to China. Ultimately, efforts to constrain China’s ability to produce advanced semiconductors ensure its ongoing reliance on Western technology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Global semiconductor market share</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>By company headquarters location</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733705795019_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1353\" data-height=\"535\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733705795019_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Global semiconductor market share\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"253\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733705795019_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733705795019_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733705795019_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733705795019_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">China’s geopolitical levers</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While U.S. policy measures have perhaps slowed China’s AI progress, they have not prevented Beijing from continuing to advance. This was evident in last year’s release of China’s DeepSeek AI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DEEPSEEK\" title=\"Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd.\">DEEPSEEK</a>) model, widely viewed as China’s “Sputnik” moment, which triggered a temporary sell-off in U.S. tech-sector darlings after Beijing demonstrated it could deliver a high-performance AI model at a lower cost.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China, after all, has been able to work around U.S. advanced semiconductor constraints by clustering large numbers of lower-grade chips and absorbing the higher energy costs required to run them. Simultaneously, Beijing has used its own geopolitical levers to ease U.S. export restrictions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China also maintains a dominant position in another critical tech input, rare earth elements, which are used heavily across industries, notably tech and defense, for their magnetic and luminescent properties once refined. While China commands almost 70% of the global market share in rare earth mining, its dominance is greater in rare earth refining and magnet production—over 90% and 98% of global market share, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over decades, China has built unmatched expertise and scale in rare earth refining—a complex, labor-intensive, and expensive process—while the rest of the world, including the U.S., has become increasingly reliant on it. This U.S. vulnerability became evident when China retaliated against U.S. tariffs last year, prompting renewed negotiations given both countries’ interdependence in the AI supply chain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notably, China recently imposed rare earth export restrictions on Japan in response to Japan’s stance on Taiwan, a sign that China will likely continue to use this policy lever as long as the U.S. and other countries remain dependent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>China vs. U.S. market share of rare earth production</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>Magnets and other rare earth elements</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733887814076_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1358\" data-height=\"589\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733887814076_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"China vs. U.S. market share of rare earth production\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"278\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733887814076_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733887814076_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733887814076_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721733887814076_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, recent geopolitical events may have a common theme around the race to AI dominance and restricting rivals’ access to critical resources.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>U.S. actions in Venezuela/Iran</strong>: Recent U.S. military intervention in Venezuela and heightened tensions in Iran have sparked debates about whether the U.S. seeks to restrict China’s oil access, thereby gaining another geopolitical lever against Beijing.</li> <li> <strong>U.S. actions in Greenland</strong>: Beyond its strategic location for monitoring missile activity, there is a debate around Greenland’s mineral wealth and its potential role in global tech supply chains, also emphasizing American efforts to access natural resources while limiting China.</li> <li> <strong>China military drills around Taiwan</strong>: China recently conducted military drills around Taiwan’s major ports, simulating a potential blockade that would isolate the island. The U.S.’s ongoing reliance on Taiwan, which manufactures roughly 90% of the world’s most powerful semiconductors, leaves U.S. tech vulnerable to potential supply chain disruptions, especially a Chinese-initiated halt to semiconductor exports.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As long as the U.S. and China remain reliant on one another for key AI inputs, tail risks are somewhat contained. However, reducing this mutual dependence (an effort underway on both sides) could increase tail risks, though the outcome or timing of such an event is essentially impossible to pinpoint.<sup> <a href=\"https://www.principalam.com/us/insights/macro-views/geopolitics-age-ai#footnote1_n5utc6k\" title=\"View footnote 1\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a> </sup>For now, markets may simply contend with ongoing headline risk, which they have grown accustomed to since Liberation Day.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Economic and investment implications</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far this year, the geopolitical landscape has had a limited market impact, as no single event has triggered a crisis in AI and its supply chain. However, as investors navigate an increasingly uncertain environment, slow-building policy actions aimed at advancing national ambitions and curbing rivals’ influence within the AI space should not be overlooked.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The concentration of the U.S. equity market within a few large tech companies—firms that would be substantially affected by restrictions on critical resources and supply chain disruptions—highlights the importance of geopolitical risk to the overall market. A negative event impacting the tech sector or individual firms could reverberate through the broader U.S. and global economies. This is particularly concerning given that tech capital expenditures have become crucial to economic growth, and households, especially those with higher incomes, have significant exposure to tech-concentrated equity markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In essence, the chokepoints within the tech sector and its expanding influence on both portfolios and the economy suggest that if U.S./China tech capabilities are undermined by policy actions, geopolitics could transition from a background concern to a catalyst for substantial economic consequences.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The unpredictability of such events underscores the importance of broader diversification as a strategy to mitigate potential shocks and help contain downside tail risk. To reduce reliance on U.S. tech, investors might explore opportunities across various regions, particularly Europe, emerging markets, and the broader U.S. equity market, such as the S&amp;P 493, all of which offer supportive domestic tailwinds beyond just AI. Additionally, commodities, especially precious metals, may gain a more prominent role in portfolios if resource hoarding leads to inflationary pressures or geopolitical behaviors spark bouts of market volatility. Furthermore, industries poised to benefit from heightened geopolitical tensions, such as defense and aerospace, offer additional opportunities for investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By adopting a diverse investment strategy, one can better navigate the intricate and evolving landscape of global markets.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Footnotes</h4> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li><p>The U.S. proposed Pax Silica, a strategic partnership among key countries—excluding China— designed to secure access to key inputs in the AI supply chains. U.S. government entities have also acquired stakes in U.S.-based rare earth refiners to accelerate independence, thereby reducing China dependence. China has expanded trade relationships across Asia and more recently with Canada, a long-time U.S. trading partner who has received over $70 million in funding through the U.S. Defense Production Act to support Canada’s critical mineral development. Additionally, reports claim that Beijing successfully reverse-engineered an ASML-style EUV machine, marking an important milestone toward semiconductor autonomy.</p></li></ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.principalam.com/us/insights/macro-views/geopolitics-age-ai\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

Investors are watching closely because the outcome could reshape the risk premium built into several markets, including precious metals and oil.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That creates a two-sided setup for gold. Ongoing uncertainty around the talks supports haven demand, but signs of progress can also reduce some of the urgency to own defensive assets. In other words, the negotiations are helping keep gold elevated while also making traders cautious about chasing the metal too aggressively at current levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The same pattern has shown up across other markets. Oil prices eased on Thursday as optimism around the talks reduced some supply risk concerns - a reminder that any clear diplomatic progress can quickly alter cross-market positioning. That matters for gold because it shows investors are actively repricing geopolitical risk rather than simply adding to it.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rates and dollar keep the rally measured</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The U.S. rate backdrop is still important. The 10-year Treasury yield was holding around 4.03% to 4.05%, a level that is high enough to limit enthusiasm for a non-yielding asset such as gold but not so high that it forces heavy selling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The dollar was also steady rather than disruptive. The dollar index remained near 97.7 to 97.8, which kept some pressure on bullion by making it more expensive for non-U.S. buyers, but the currency move was not strong enough to knock gold out of its current range.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What traders are watching next</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next obvious macro event is the U.S. Personal Income and Outlays report for January 2026, scheduled for March 13. Because that release includes the PCE price index, it is likely to shape expectations for Fed policy and, by extension, the next move in yields, the dollar and gold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Until then, the market appears to be balancing three forces at once: strong underlying demand for bullion, resistance near $5,200, and uncertainty around the Geneva talks. That mix can keep gold firm, but it can also make price action look choppy from one session to the next.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the near term, the metal still looks well supported, but the next push higher may require either a softer rates backdrop or a fresh rise in demand for safe assets. Without that, gold may continue to hover near current levels while traders wait for the next decisive headline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, an increased interest in gold is being observed against the global stagflation shock and instability, as the gold price has a negative correlation with traditional markets. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>This material may contain third-party opinions; none of the data and information on this webpage constitutes investment advice according to our <a href=\"https://tradersunion.com/terms-of-use/#p10\" rel=\"nofollow\">Disclaimer</a>.

Government energy subsidy measures<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> drove inflation lower quite meaningfully. Utility prices, such as electricity and gas, fell further by 6.6% in February compared to -2.2% in January. Cereal prices (mostly rice) grew notably less, from 11.3% in January to 7.5%. The high base for rice prices will continue to weigh on inflation throughout this year. Energy subsidies will end soon, so we expect temporary volatility in monthly changes. Yet, other government welfare programs, such as free tuition, are likely to lower inflation in the latter part of the year.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although core inflation eased, we believe underlying price pressure remained sticky, as most of the price decline was driven by goods rather than services. In a monthly seasonally-adjusted comparison, inflation fell 0.1% month-on-month, with goods prices down 0.6% and services up 0.2%.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Energy and food prices dropped while underlying inflation remain sticky</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716590338671_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"812\" data-height=\"370\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716590338671_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Energy and food prices dropped while underlying inflation remain sticky\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"292\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716590338671_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716590338671_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716590338671_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716590338671_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: CEIC</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The BoJ will need additional evidence to hike rates</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going forward, inflation is expected to stay below 2%. Yet, service prices, primarily driven by rising labour costs and strong demand, are likely to remain firm. This is expected to support the Bank of Japan’s policy normalisation of modest rate hikes. We believe it’s important to monitor April inflation data since that’s when many businesses set new prices based on their costs -- at the beginning of the fiscal year. As we mentioned in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874329-bank-of-japan-wont-alter-policy-normalization-path\" rel=\"noopener\">an earlier publication</a>, the recent BoJ board nominees who lean towards dovish policies will require stricter criteria to be met for rate hikes. Therefore, the BoJ is expected to act in June, once the results of the spring wage negotiations and the April CPI figures have been confirmed.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The dove-hawk balance may not change meaningfully with two new dovish-tilting nominees</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716786960583_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"803\" data-height=\"424\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716786960583_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The dove-hawk balance may not change meaningfully with two new dovish-tilting nominees\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"338\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716786960583_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716786960583_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716786960583_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716786960583_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Bank of Japan, ING estimates</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716988720968.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Industrial production\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"618\" height=\"159\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716988720968.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716988720968.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721716988720968.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Auto sector recovery helped drive monthly data improvement</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Industrial production and retail sales rebounded in January, suggesting GDP growth will accelerate in the first quarter. IP rebounded 2.2% MoM in January (vs -0.1% in December, 5.5% market consensus), and retail sales also were up 4.1% (vs -2.0% in December, 1.5% market consensus). Details of both data were quite encouraging, as gains were widely spread. But also, the improvement in auto sector activity was quite impressive. Motor vehicle output rose for the second month, by 9.1% in January, following a 1.4% gain in December. Shipments rebounded to 8.8% after dropping in the previous two months. Motor vehicle retail sales surged 12.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stronger-than-expected retail sales data indicate that private consumption will lead growth, supported by strong wage growth. We believe lower inflation, helped by subsidies, will partly enhance consumers' purchasing power. Also, the recent rally in the local equity market should contribute positively to consumption. Today’s data support our view that GDP is expected to accelerate in 1Q26, driven by solid exports and consumption.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Retail sales rebounded firmly in January</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721717153395338_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"794\" data-height=\"390\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721717153395338_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Retail sales rebounded firmly in January\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"314\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721717153395338_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721717153395338_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721717153395338_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721717153395338_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: CEIC</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"paywall-full-content\"></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Perhaps as a response to high prices and inflation, consumers are increasingly turning to<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> secondhand goods, including and especially in the luxury category, to fulfill their shopping.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TheRealReal (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/REAL\" title=\"The RealReal, Inc.\">REAL</a></span>), one of the leading \"re-commerce\" platforms, clearly demonstrates that shift in spending priorities. The company has showcased accelerating GMV across several quarters, allowing the company to generate meaningful economies of scale. In a market that has been incredibly punishing for growth stocks, TheRealReal has achieved nearly 2x share price appreciation over the past year, and a recent strong Q4 earnings print helped boost shares by a further ~10% (though the stock still remains down in January, along with most other small/mid-cap growth names).</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6023daaf44fbbdb584a38e61f8f645e9.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6023daaf44fbbdb584a38e61f8f645e9.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6023daaf44fbbdb584a38e61f8f645e9.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_6023daaf44fbbdb584a38e61f8f645e9.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4841873-the-realreal-accelerating-growth-in-a-tough-consumer-backdrop\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4841873-the-realreal-accelerating-growth-in-a-tough-consumer-backdrop\" target=\"_blank\">I last wrote a \"Buy\" article</a> on TheRealReal in November, when the stock was trading at $11 per share. The company has been a major bright spot in my small/mid-cap portfolio, and with strong results and rising GMV under its belt, I don't see TheRealReal's outperformance coming to a halt anytime soon. I'm reiterating my \"Buy\"<strong> </strong>rating on this stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, there are a number of tailwinds that the company enjoys that cement the bull case for TheRealReal:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Accelerating GMV at scale. It's abundantly evident from TheRealReal's results that used luxury commerce is having its moment in the spotlight, with several sequential quarters of GMV growth despite reaching a sizable &gt;$2 billion annual scale.</li> <li>Large TAM. The company believes its annual addressable market for luxury resale in the United States is $200 billion, indicating its current GMV is only about ~1% penetrated into the total opportunity.</li> <li>Consignment focus has improved gross margin profile. In the past, TheRealReal used to run a mix of consignment/third-party sales alongside taking on its own inventory. The company has since shifted to becoming a capital-light, consignment-first business, which has pushed gross margins up to the mid-70%s: allowing for incredible economies of scale.</li> <li>Potential tailwinds from the gold boom. Management notes that one of the most popular categories on TheRealReal's platform is luxury gold watches (think brands like Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet).</li> <li>Leveraging AI to drive down cost. Though TheRealReal is still trading at rich adjusted EBITDA multiples, its bottom line is growing rapidly thanks to the company's use of automation to keep its cost base at reasonable levels while revenue and GMV expand, allowing for substantial margin expansion.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stay long here and keep riding TheRealReal's post-earnings momentum higher.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 download</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's now run through TheRealReal's latest quarterly results in greater detail. The Q4 earnings summary is shown below:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721534942595015_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"924\" data-height=\"1146\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721534942595015_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TheRealReal Q4 results\" width=\"640\" height=\"794\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"794\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721534942595015_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721534942595015_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721534942595015_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721534942595015_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">TheRealReal Q4 results <span>(TheRealReal Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TheRealReal's revenue grew 18% y/y to $194.1 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $190.8 million (+16% y/y) by a two-point margin. Revenue growth accelerated slightly versus 17% y/y growth in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The acceleration was driven by a boost in GMV, up 22% y/y to $616 million (and also accelerating two points versus 20% y/y growth in Q3). The company notes that GMV growth was driven by both an increase in the number of sales on the platform as well as a higher average price per sale. We do note that take rates, which represent TheRealReal's revenue as a percentage of consignment GMV sales, dipped -120 bps to 36.5%. This isn't a major concern, however, as the company attributed the take rate erosion due to the higher mix of high-end luxury sales that typically carry lower commissions for TheRealReal (but nevertheless profit strong gross profit dollars).</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721535161028154_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2054\" data-height=\"1154\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721535161028154_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TheRealReal GMV trends\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721535161028154_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721535161028154_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721535161028154_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/33427965-17721535161028154_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">TheRealReal GMV trends <span>(TheRealReal Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the company's active buyer base increased by 32k net-new users in Q4. It's important to note that TheRealReal's core focus for 2026 is to sustain longer-term relationships with its users. It's moving from becoming a transactional platform to an \"advisor for the closest.\" The company is noticing that many of its buyers are eventually also becoming sellers on the platform, and buyers who purchase secondhand luxury often do so with resale value in mind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is realizing this vision through the release of MyCloset, which helps users to track the items they own and get price data for them. Per CEO Rati Levesque's remarks on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4876029-the-realreal-inc-real-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 earnings call</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>Our marketing engine drives our sales execution. Active buyer growth accelerated in Q4 to 9% on a trailing 12-month basis. We aren’t just finding shoppers – we are identifying future consignors. Our Q4 results highlight this flywheel in action – 40% of new consignors come from our existing buyer base. By turning buyers into sellers, we’re acquiring supply more cost effectively while deepening the loyalty of our community. We accelerated new buyer growth in Q4 and we believe it’s a positive catalyst for future supply [...]</p> <p>As you may recall, we introduced MyCloset last year. The first phase was “reconsign,” which provides a one-click consignment experience for items purchased on TRR’s platform. The next step in the evolution of MyCloset is customer tools to track and capitalize on the value of their closet.

We emphasize the fact that TheRealReal isn't a value stock, but at the same time, the company is still relatively early in its profit journey. We think there's a lot of conservatism baked into the company's FY26 outlook, especially given it's calling for only a 7.9% margin when it exited Q4 at an 11.3% margin. With adjusted EBITDA currently growing at a ~2x y/y pace, near-term valuation multiples are less meaningful for TheRealReal: so don't pass up on this stock just because it looks expensive on paper.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"Buy\" the post-earnings momentum and stay long.</p>",

Net returns are net of management fees only.</p> <h3>Five-Year Retrospective</h3> <p>Before getting into a bit more detail on 2025 returns, we wanted to look back at how the strategy has performed in the various environments of the last five years.</p> <p>Initially, it looked as if the Asset Allocation team's thesis that the valuation gap would narrow was going to play out quite smoothly. As the world slowly returned to a post-Covid normality, value stocks that had been beaten down recovered nicely, while the growth darlings like Zoom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZM\" title=\"Zoom Communications, Inc.\">ZM</a>) and Peloton (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PTON\" title=\"Peloton Interactive, Inc.\">PTON</a>) crashed back down to earth. From Equity Dislocation's October 2020 inception through December 2022, MSCI ACWI Value beat MSCI ACWI Growth fairly comfortably, and the strategy had a return profile within expectations, returning 40.3% cumulatively gross of fees (34.1% net).</p> <p>The emergence of Chat GPT into the mainstream at the start of 2023 reinvigorated investor enthusiasm for growth, however, putting a halt to value's winning streak. MSCI ACWI Value has underperformed MSCI ACWI Growth for each of the last three calendar years by an average of more than 10% per annum. Despite this headwind, the strategy has managed to generate a modest positive cumulative return over this 3-year period.</p> <p>We have noted previously that, even if the abnormally wide valuation spread does not narrow immediately, value can still outperform due to what we call the rebalancing effect: value benefits as some growth companies disappoint and become cheaper, entering the value index. Value also benefits as some value companies surprise on the upside and get repriced into the growth index. This effect is particularly pronounced when valuation spreads are wide because the valuation change associated with a move from value to growth, or from growth to value, is large. In the context of the Equity Dislocation Strategy, this rebalancing effect is demonstrated as strong security selection. It is this strong security selection, combined with effective risk controls, that has allowed us to generate a positive return over the last three years.</p> <p>We believe that this profile can be maintained, with the strategy managing remarkably well through periods of growth outperformance, while still delivering the excellent returns that we would expect in periods of value dominance. (For example, the last two months of 2025 saw value rotate back into the ascendancy—MSCI ACWI Value beat MSCI ACWI Growth by 5.0%, with the Equity Dislocation Strategy up 8.7% gross of fees and 8.3% net for the same period).</p> <p>From a diversification perspective, it is also worth noting that the strategy has exhibited a modest negative beta of -0.18 to MSCI ACWI over the period. We do not attempt to target negative beta. The strategy remains broadly dollar neutral (100% long/100% short) and so could be expected to be market and beta neutral. In reality, the overvaluations of growth stocks leave them much more susceptible to any kind of downturn, as we saw in 2022. That year was the only one of the last five years to deliver a negative return for equities, with MSCI ACWI down -18.4% and MSCI ACWI Growth trailing far behind at -28.6%. The Equity Dislocation Strategy returned 16.6% gross of fees (14.2% net) in 2022, and we believe that, similarly, it is likely to deliver meaningful, diversifying negative beta just when you need it in a growth-led sell-off.</p> <h3>Exciting Outlook</h3> <p>As we write in early January 2026, our 20% exposure 1 to the <a href=\"https://www.gmo.com/americas/product-index-page/alternatives/equity-dislocation-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Equity Dislocation Strategy</a> remains the biggest high-conviction position in the Asset Allocation team's flagship unconstrained <a href=\"https://www.gmo.com/americas/product-index-page/multi-asset-class/benchmark-free-allocation-strategy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Benchmark-Free Allocation Strategy</a> . Quite simply, we believe that there is still considerable money to be made as the spread between value and growth inevitably narrows.</p> <p>We have included Exhibit 2 in our previous annual letters. When we launched the strategy, the relative valuation of the cheapest 50% of U.S. stocks over the most expensive 50% was at the 2nd percentile. Following two strong years for value in 2021 and 2022, the spread had narrowed to the 14th percentile. However, growth's dominance in 2023 and 2024, along with a modest win in 2025, has reversed all of that. The spread now sits very close to where we started, at the incredibly attractive 4th percentile. For value to return to its median historic relative valuation in the U.S., it needs to outperform growth by 70%. Globally, value would have to outperform by roughly 50% to return to a fair relative valuation.</p> <h4>Exhibit 2: Value Is Extremely Cheap</h4> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-17721710618676891_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1134\" data-height=\"460\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/542689-17721710618676891_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Line chart showing the Relative Valuation of Cheapest 50% of U.S. Stock Market vs. Expensive Less Average from 1981 to 2023.

The long portfolio returned 33.0% gross, outpacing the MSCI ACWI Value return of 22.0% gross. The short portfolio also added meaningful alpha, having been up only 17.4% compared to the MSCI ACWI Growth return of 22.4%.</p> <p>In developed markets outside of the U.S., value beat growth fairly comfortably and the strategy performed as expected, with some 10.1% gross added to absolute performance. Some of the top performers were textbook deep value positions, as four of the top ten contributing long positions were Financials. Our meaningful yet well-diversified exposure to Automobiles and Auto Components was also significantly positive despite tariff-related volatility throughout the year.</p> <p>Growth modestly outperformed value in emerging markets, and the region detracted -1.0% from absolute performance. Although the long portfolio did very well, up 48.6% gross, the short book was up 63.6% gross. You probably would not have guessed that this result was in no small part due to three Korean Industrial stocks that enjoyed an average return of 165%. (For example, Doosan Enerbility (DOHFF), in the fast-moving game of nuclear power plant construction, was up a truly remarkable 270%.)</p> <p>The strategy successfully added 3.4% to absolute performance in the U.S., a real triumph given that MSCI USA Growth beat MSCI USA Value by 8.0%. Of course, our thoughtful risk control measures, coupled with our focus on quality in security selection, gave us a head start on this naïve measure as we did not overly suffer from the surge in some of the mega-cap tech. Although the long portfolio in the U.S. enjoyed strong performance, most of the alpha was added by the short portfolio.</p> <p>The most interesting sector was Information Technology, where we were short 28 U.S. securities. Despite it being a very strong year for equities, with the MSCI USA Growth Index up 20.9%, 18 of those stocks had negative performance while they were in the portfolio, and another two stocks had single-digit performance.</p> <p>One of the worst performers in the group for the year, which averaged an 80-bp short position and added 0.4% to absolute performance, was HubSpot (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUBS\" title=\"HubSpot, Inc.\">HUBS</a>). If you are anxious to know what severe economic challenges HubSpot faced to send its shares crashing more than 40%, we will have to disappoint you—HubSpot grew its customers and revenues by broadly 20% during the year without compromising margins. Quite simply, high expectations for huge earnings beats meant that even strong results were viewed as insufficient, leading to sharp sell-offs. This is a key reason why we are not obsessing over identifying the catalyst for future growth stock underperformance—the weight of expectation built into valuations will inevitably lead to investor disappointment at some point.</p> <p>The other eight U.S. Information Technology stocks that we held short delivered an average performance of more than 63%. Palantir (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLTR\" title=\"Palantir Technologies Inc.\">PLTR</a>), which was the single biggest detractor from absolute returns at the total portfolio level, was up a spectacular 135% for the year and is, somewhat bewilderingly, trading at a price/sales ratio well in excess of 100.

Correlations are breaking down, political and fiscal paths<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> are diverging, and yield curves are telling different stories across regions. At the same time, investors are grappling with a familiar constraint. Spreads are tight, so where can you still find attractive income, diversification, and flexibility without making a dramatic sell the US call?</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My name is Anu Rajakumar, and today I'm joined by Paul Grainger, Senior Portfolio Manager on the Global Fixed Income team. Paul, welcome to the show.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> Thank you for having me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Paul, let's start with some of the macro backdrop. For a while, especially during COVID and right after, it felt like everyone around the world was living through the same shocks, supply chains, the reopening surge. We saw policymakers around the world responding fairly similarly with big fiscal spending and then aggressive rate hikes, et cetera.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fast forward to today, and policy paths look less uniform, and markets are starting to diverge. Why should investors pay attention to these shifts and the correlations that are starting to break down? What's driving it, and how does that create opportunity for investors?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> I think the key point is what you've highlighted. There are opportunities for investors even in the current environment. I think the last three years generally rewarded a pretty straightforward approach to managing fixed income assets. You own duration to benefit from rates coming down. You own credit to benefit from the improved credit quality, but also the support to the economy from rates coming down. With hindsight, which is a wonderful thing, that was quite an easy trade to do. The question as we look forward is, where do we go from this when policy rates are closer to neutral?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They may not be there, but we're definitely closer. Credit spreads are tight. The macro and political risks are more varied across regions than they've been for some time. There is still income to be had from the market, but there's still the risk of volatility. The question really is, how do we deal with that? Part of it comes from what you said that the correlations are breaking down. Correlations breaking down is not necessarily a bad thing. It actually provides opportunities to allocate capital between different regions, between different sectors of the economy, between different parts of the yield curve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I do think that in the current environment, as part of a broader asset allocation, fixed income is really important as part of that diversification. The things that we'll be looking for as we go forward, for these correlations, but also the opportunities, are geopolitics. Just to be clear, this isn't just about the US and what's happening there. Obviously, we read a lot about US politics, but it's also what's happening in different parts of the world. We've clearly got different political dynamics happening in different countries in Europe. We've got an election coming up in Japan, although that will be done by the time many of the listeners listen to this podcast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We've also got a lot of tensions in the UK, where I sit, with risks around the government and challenges potentially to the leadership of the ruling Labor Party. All these things on geopolitics, coupled with different growth rates, different inflation paths, and these varying fiscal constraints, mean that the ability of bond markets and economies to move in sync is going to be challenged as we go forward. That is actually to us really interesting and also to our clients.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Excellent. Now, you've mentioned a few different areas and regions. Europe is not just one homogeneous block either. It's lots of individual countries. Tell us more about why that's important for folks to really consider.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> I think actually that's a really important factor for investors, particularly for those investors who haven't historically invested in Europe. It's been quite easy for people in the past to look at Europe as one place and to say, Europe's doing well; Europe's doing badly. Those relationships really broke down during the Eurozone crisis, and actually, they've flipped on their head since then. During the Eurozone crisis, I'm sure everyone remembers, it was all about the periphery: Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece struggling. They were really seen as the poor links, the poor relations in Europe, the bond markets you didn't want to own.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">France and Germany were seen as the core stable markets where you wanted to allocate capital. That's really been turned on its head in the past few years, and it's been turned on its head for a couple of reasons. One is those periphery countries took their medicine. They went through some of the pain of having to tighten their fiscal budgetary positions. They've been through political changes. Some of them have more political stability than they have had in the past. At the same time, places like France have struggled to get its budget through in the past year, and there is more political uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The political dynamics have shifted. To put it in context, in 2022, Italian bond yields were around 2% higher than French bond yields. That yield spread now is the same. Italian and French bond yields in the 10-Year maturity are trading at the same yield level. Now, part of that is due to this changing, shifting political dynamics. Part of it clearly is due to the fact that investors have chased yield and wanted to move down the credit spectrum. That's been underpinned by improving fundamentals. To give a bit of an insight into Italy and what's happening there in domestic politics, Giorgia Meloni has now been in power for more than three years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This may not sound like a long time for many investors on the call or many people listening. To put it in historical perspective, and I think these numbers are right, but I'm sure someone will fact-check and tell me if I'm wrong, I think there've been 31 prime ministers in Italy in the last 80 years, with only 6 of those serving more than 3 years. It's a big shift to actually have someone who's getting policy done, but also getting policy done when having been prudent and having gotten more credibility from the market. I think if people had said that five years ago, there would have been question marks around that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I guess where it leaves us is that, to your point that you raised, which is we have to look at Europe as a collection of countries, not a homogeneous block. As investors, that causes some challenges because the correlations are breaking down, but it also provide opportunity to allocate between those countries and not just think about allocating between the big blocks of US, Europe, and Asia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Yes, that's terrific. That role reversal of some of those countries in Europe is really quite astounding. Maybe just to continue on this theme, you mentioned this global phenomenon, and I just want to hear a little bit more. When you say global fixed income, how would you characterize the material differences between investing within the US bond market and investing globally? Also, just curious, what parts of the global market do you think people often overlook that actually can deliver that yield and diversification?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> I think if I had to sum it up in one word, it would be breadth. The breadth of the global bond market is far wider than the US bond market. It's not a negative on the US bond market. It's just the facts of where issuances come from governments around the world, from corporates around the world, and from the so-called supranational and sovereign and agency issues. Essentially, we have multiple currencies, more countries, and a wider set of issuer types. We have 76 countries in the global bond index. We've got 29 currencies. We're able to rotate capital around those.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More importantly, from a benchmark or a universe perspective for clients, what it means is you get some natural diversification. I guess it links to your earlier question about correlations. Post-COVID, correlations were really high. Markets, economies were moving in lockstep, particularly in the developed world. Even in developed markets now, we're starting to see divergence between those countries and those currencies. That gives a natural, almost hedge or natural cadence to these global portfolios, which means that you're not putting all your fixed income risk in one country and one currency related to one economy. That is really powerful.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It should be noted as well that the global bond index does have some exposure to the so-called emerging markets, even though in this index, it is only investment grade. It's the higher-quality emerging markets there. Why is that important? It's important because for some time, they've taken a different path in terms of their economy, their monetary policy. They were earlier in raising rates than we were in the developed world. That means that we're now seeing a lot of opportunity come out in emerging markets. That, again, gives this natural diversification from being in global fixed income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One thing that I will highlight that I think is a bit different when we look at the global bond market than just the US market is this so-called supranational sovereign and agency paper. These are bonds that are issued by entities that are linked to governments. They are very high-quality, typically AAA or AA. They can actually be higher quality than the individual governments because of the cross-governmental guarantees that come through. They're a big part of the benchmark. They're 20% of the benchmark. We're fortunate that we can access that market in a liquid way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Yes. No, that's very fair. The last question, you talked about the breadth of the opportunities, potentially rotating capital across dozens of countries and currencies to find that income and diversification. Paul, I want to touch on the US dollar as well. Of course, it depreciated quite significantly in 2025. General consensus is that it'll continue to depreciate in 2026, perhaps not to the same magnitude. I'd love to hear about your views on that and how that affects the opportunity set.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> Clearly, the dollar depreciated quite materially. There are a lot of forces at work, geopolitics, but also the fact that the Federal Reserve was cutting interest rates. We continue to think, as we said, the Fed will cut interest rates as the market's pricing. There are risks to the downside with a new Fed chair. However, the dollar can still come under pressure, but that is not necessarily the reason to be in global fixed income and to diversify and have a broader opportunity set.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason for a broader opportunity set is because of the potential for returns from that opportunity set, irrespective of what the dollar does, but also the ability to diversify and the ability to tap into other markets. Just to be clear, this isn't a dollar trade. This isn't the sell the US and buy everything else. This is part of a natural allocation that should be there in portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> I think that's a really important differentiation. This is not just a currency play, right?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> Absolutely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Now, if we go region by region, I'd love to hear about where your team is seeing the most interesting relative value opportunities and what are some of the risks you're watching most closely, and further to that, any areas that you are actually avoiding at the moment?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> I think in relative value opportunities, we always have to bring it back to what's being priced in by the market. We're constructive on European fixed income, and part of that is that we see European growth disappointing. We see ability for the European Central Bank to cut interest rates further. Right now, the market is pricing no further interest rate cuts from the ECB. That is an opportunity to allocate capital at relatively attractive European yields but also benefit from what we think will be interest rate cuts. That contrasts slightly with the US, where, again, we see the scope for interest rate cuts, but the market is already pricing that to some extent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We're much more driven there by the trading range environment that we're in. You put those two together, and it means that we are looking to be within global portfolios, overweight Europe relative to the US. Another area that I think until a few years ago people weren't really focusing on was Japan. Japan had been a market that no one had invested in, really, as an overseas investor or an international investor for many decades. That changed two or three years ago. We think there's a really interesting opportunity in Japan. There is volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We do think that that market, which is pricing in, I think, three interest rate hikes now, is obviously looking at a very different place to other global bond markets. We don't think that we'll get three interest rate hikes. We think on that basis, there is value in the market already. The yield curve is relatively steep because of concerns about fiscal issuance and the ongoing funding of the government. We actually think that that will provide an opportunity</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't think there are areas that we're particularly negative or concerned about within fixed income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I would say is that within credit, credit spreads are tight. That comes down now to really focusing on where are the good quality companies, where are we going to be able to harvest some incremental income, some incremental returns, but also accept the fact that we will get bouts of volatility coming through there. We are relatively defensive, but do think there will be opportunities coming up</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Terrific. You laid up the next question yourself. Turning to credit. As you said, lots of questions are about tight spreads at the moment. Where are the good opportunities within credit? How are you approaching the area? What are the concerns that you have around credit?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> I think the first thing I'll say is that we spend a lot of our time, like other fixed-income investors, focusing on spreads. Actually, we should be clear that across the fixed income universe, all-in yields still look relatively attractive. We should be clear that corporate bonds still give you income, so they still have a place in people's portfolios. When we look at the relative spreads and the relative pricing between corporates and governments, clearly, we're at a narrow end of the range that we've been in for some time. Spreads are tight for a reason.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They're tight because we've had improved credit quality, the positive growth environment we've been in, the support that we've had from central banks with interest rates being cut, and also, like every asset, they're driven by supply and demand. We've seen a lot of demand for fixed income and a lot of demand for corporate bonds. We think that will continue as we go through the year because there is this demand for income, because income gives you the cushion to the rest of your portfolio. To think about the question of where are the opportunities, the opportunities we think now are going to be in relative sector calls, looking at different issuers that come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, we know there is issuance coming to the market, and we can harvest some of that new issue premium. Clearly, one of the things we've seen recently is that the AI-related names, credit spreads have widened. Now, clearly, that's something that has been happening, but looking forward, we do think there's going to be opportunity in those names as well. Timing is not necessarily today, but these relative repricings will provide opportunities for us to allocate capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We're also going to have to think carefully about where we allocate on the yield curve. Do we allocate to shorter-dated bonds or to bonds that are further out the curve? We're going to continue to see that. I think the key thing I would say is that in this environment, we're not in an environment where the rising tide of demand lifts all boats and all assets. So we're going to have to be much more nuanced about where we're allocating capital. We're going to have to really focus on research, in-depth analysis of the company, staying engaged, and being cognizant of the risks around us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Yes, no, and to your point, in an environment where we think there's going to be above-trend growth for 2026, fundamentals still look solid, that credit is something that can continue to stay on the table for most investors, I think. Paul, on implementation, if an investor wants global exposure but also wants to stay nimble, how would you suggest that they go about building that into a portfolio?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> That's a great question because I think everything we've talked about is -- the fixed income's attractive, but it's going to be more nuanced. There's going to be more volatility around that. I think that's actually the benefit of a global fixed income approach is that you can allocate capital relatively quickly between the sectors, between countries, and to different parts of the yield curve should opportunities arise. I think for us, that says have a broad approach. It says allow flexibility, but flexibility within bands or within bounds, we obviously have ranges that we will look to allocate to duration to curve to different countries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the key here is that we need to think about every part of the market separately and look at how they trade relative to each other and look at those opportunities. As I said before, we need to really understand that even in places like Europe, it's a collection of different countries. When we think about Asia, it's a collection of different countries, and there will be opportunities coming across there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that the key part here is this is a liquid market. This is public bonds. They're liquid. We can reallocate capital really quickly, and we can redeploy as opportunities arise. Really, why do we see this global universe as being a natural part of investors' asset allocation?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Excellent. Maybe just one final follow-up there. Tell us where emerging markets fit into this discussion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> As I alluded to before, I think emerging markets have been in a slightly different cycle to developed markets. One could say that emerging markets reacted to the inflation threat a lot earlier than developed markets. Now granted, their inflation basket is very different to developed markets, but they reacted earlier, they tightened policy earlier, and that means that they're in a slightly different place in the cycle. Emerging markets were also an asset class that saw, up until recently, net outflows. So there's not a lot of crowded positions there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We're certainly starting to see a lot of opportunity in emerging markets from the fundamental side, from valuations, and from technicals. We're also starting to see clients reallocate capital to emerging markets as they search for added income. I would say that the valuation metrics for emerging markets relative to credit right now are still attractive</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Excellent. Thank you very much for those comments. Paul, I can't let you go without a quick bonus question. Of course, the market environment is very volatile. So I'd like to know what you tend to do to help you reset and think clearly outside the office.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> That's a good question. I actually play quite a random, esoteric sport that many people on this podcast won't have heard of, called real tennis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Tell us more about real tennis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> Real tennis is essentially Henry VIII's version of tennis. One of the few similarities is it has a ball, it has a net, and it has a racket. The differences are it's an enclosed court. You can play off any wall. There are certain hazards there, or nets that you can hit, that you get bonus points that automatically win the point. You also play with a wooden racket that is not symmetrical.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would encourage anyone who's interested look it up online. It's completely random. The scoring is also relatively complicated as well. It is quite good to disconnect from work because you have to concentrate on trying to hit a ball that is hand-sewn, so it doesn't bounce the same way. The scoring is slightly random. I would say that it's -- you can either try and play the point or remember the score. It is something that...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar: </strong>You can't do both.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> You can't do both. It is something that requires a lot of concentration. It does mean that you switch off quite meaningfully from work.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar</strong>: I love that. Thank you so much for sharing that. It's a fun fact about yourself. Paul, this is a great discussion today. Maybe just to quickly summarize a few of the comments that you said. You mentioned that investors shouldn't abandon US assets and follow that sell the US trade. Our conversation was really about the marginal allocation decisions that really are starting to matter more as markets and policy paths diverge.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We talked about correlations that have come down, and the global fixed income opportunity set really looks more differentiated than it has in recent years. We talked about rotating capital and accessing dozens of countries and currencies to find income and diversification. You've talked about some of the views that the fixed income team has at the moment, at Neuberger, overweight Europe versus the US, where there could be potential mispricing from the ECB. You also highlighted Japan as an area that's attractive due to the valuation opportunity and the steep yield curve there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then, finally, hopefully, I'm summarizing this fairly, that in an environment of tight spreads, the combination of income diversification flexibility plus the ability to be nimble when those dislocations appear can be especially valuable for investors. Hopefully, I summarized that okay for you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger:</strong> That's absolutely perfect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anu Rajakumar:</strong> Excellent. Paul, once again, thank you so much for being on the show, and good luck in your next real tennis match.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Paul Grainger: </strong>Thank you very much. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This communication is provided for informational and educational purposes only and nothing herein constitutes investment, legal, accounting or tax advice, or a recommendation to buy, sell or hold a security.

The performance<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> in the past year and a bit more has not been great in terms of total returns compared to competition. However, a deeper look at its structure reveals a long term structural edge many of the more popular income alternatives miss - that is a strong drawdown protection layer.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The total returns suffer a bit because of the protective put layer, but it shifts the risk reward asymmetry favorably. KHPI may appear weak in strong rallies like we saw in 2025. But whenever markets consolidate, its aggressive covered call writing strategy ensures potential income even when positive trends are missing. Overall, I find KHPI as a strong income contender for long term investors (due to the protective put layer), and especially for a flatter 2026 market (due to a more aggressive covered call layer).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What the Protective Put Does</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A <a href=\"https://www.kensingtonassetmanagement.com/solutions/etfs-khpi/#performance\" rel=\"nofollow\">look at the KHPI portfolio</a> reveals how it is set up and also reveals a key differentiator that tilts the long term risk reward balance. As of February 25, 2026, the portfolio holds ~502k VOO shares. This is ~$315m at current VOO prices and close to KHPI's AUM. That is, the portfolio is fully deployed on the S&amp;P 500 with little surplus remaining to invest in treasuries or money market funds - something several peer S&amp;P 500 covered calls ETFs do, using synthetic option based exposure routes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The portfolio shows around 457 SPX put contracts. Since the S&amp;P 500 is at ~6900 now, each contract is worth ~$$690k (100 multiplier per contract). The notional coverage of this option spread layer is therefore ~$315m - almost exactly the size of the underlying holdings. This option layer is ~6% away from current spot levels and ensures that drawdowns beyond ~6% are capped, and since coverage is for the entire portfolio, this protection completely limits big drawdowns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This means if there is a crash by say 20%, KHPI limits its drawdown to only ~6%. However, if the S&amp;P 500 is down by only 4%, KHPI does not visibly show any material protective benefit. The hedge is for extreme events and often does not show its true value in most market scenarios, especially when the going is smooth like now (and in 2025). But from a risk reward balance perspective, it alters the profile of the income plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Most income focused covered call strategies generally prioritize income generation and upside capture, which means the protective put is missing and drawdown mitigation due to an option layer and premiums thereof are limited. That is if the S&amp;P 500 is down by 20%, you may very well see SPYI down by 17-18% - a lesser impact, but a fixed 2-3% protection. The open downside structure works out well in a long term bullish scenario, but the ride is often more volatile during rare crashes. By limiting crash possibilities, KHPI actually converts the total return charts into a lower return lower risk vehicle - not a bad outcome for income investors. The upside is limited because there is a cost of protection. While SPYI and GPIX often track the S&amp;P 500 with minimal drag, KHPI may be far slower in total return terms, but saves a lot more in 2020 or 2022 like crashes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Glimpses of this downside protection were visible in the sharp but limited-time drawdowns of April 2025. You may see that gap even magnify further if the crash is deeper. This risk reward characteristic difference versus peers is a long term structural advantage, and remains always applicable, although invisible for large stretches of play.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_6e29bc681e441e329dd9dc6fb63d2274.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_6e29bc681e441e329dd9dc6fb63d2274.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_6e29bc681e441e329dd9dc6fb63d2274.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_6e29bc681e441e329dd9dc6fb63d2274.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Aggressive Option Writing Layer</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The option layer consists of a call spread layer with the short call almost at the money now and a buy call layer ~3% away. This layer holds around 457 SPX contracts. Like the put layer, this layer also translates to ~$315m, which means full coverage of the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The balance of this covered call layer is important because there is a protective put layer to fund, while keeping the strategy net positive in income terms. KHPI achieves this balance by moving the protective put away (~6% away from spot as discussed before in today's setup. KHPI also aims to capture some sharp rallies too, which is why there is a buy call position ~3% away from the written call. The net effect of this setup is to ensure there is sufficient protection for more extreme drawdowns, while upsides are generally capped, but sharp upsides are somewhat captured.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, if markets stay flat it will earn some premiums from an aggressive portfolio coverage (100% coverage unlike a lot of peer covered call ETFs) closer to spot, despite funding bought puts and calls further away from the strike. So, overall KHPI earns smaller but surer income when markets are consolidating such as now, and as expected for most of 2026. Income is maximized if there are sharp rallies, remain in play when markets consolidate. And for long term holders, any tail risk event is when KHPI resets and starts much higher in any ensuing rebound phase. The net effect of this setup is that KHPI's total returns are not as exciting as say a SPYI or a GPIX, but its aggressive option writing layer enables a protective element that should work out over full cycles. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_4e535edd7fc2d7bb7135275405ffb5d1.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_4e535edd7fc2d7bb7135275405ffb5d1.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_4e535edd7fc2d7bb7135275405ffb5d1.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_4e535edd7fc2d7bb7135275405ffb5d1.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This setup works very well for a 2026-like market where the sharp upside probability appears lower. We have a hedge against potential corrections and an income source for consolidation regimes. The loss in momentum in the S&amp;P 500 is already evident in the past 3-4 months and more of that slow grind up (or a flat regime) is likely to persist for a few more quarters. I have <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872479-schgs-upgrade-engine-is-losing-steam-time-to-temper-expectations\">recently written</a> about how the markets are now re-evaluating the way they underwrite long duration risks. The AI-led rally that dominated 2024-25, will therefore likely see a phase where earnings grow into valuations and markets remain flat till another strong round of earnings revisions led by AI monetization emerges, and the capex drag dilutes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>A Strong Income Strategy</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">KHPI's yield is currently high single digits - not too aggressive like in the case of some peer ETFs who may see higher NAV erosion over time as a lot of distributions are funded through a return of capital mechanism. The expense ratio is slightly high at ~0.96% compared to 0.68% in the case of SPYI and 0.29% for a more active strategy like GPIX. I checked the distribution characteristics across a few months (sample December breakdown <a href=\"https://www.kensingtonassetmanagement.com/wp-content/uploads/KHPI-Fund-19a1-Notice-11.30.25-Confidential.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>) and saw that distributions are predominantly labeled as return of capital. That is distributions are typically not taxed immediately, but their cost basis is reduced, which can defer taxes yet increase future capital gains if shares are sold - this is neutral to slightly positive for tax deferral, but not inherently free income.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">KHPI's suitability for a long term income portfolio is high. Its setup is well poised for a more immediate term of consolidation as well. I rate KHPI as a Strong Buy for income focused investors - this on risk reward balance rather than total returns.</p>",
