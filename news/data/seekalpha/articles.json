The company operates within the Electric Utilities Industry and presently offers investors a dividend yield [FWD] of 4.80%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Iberdrola not only provides potential for dividend income, but also for dividend growth, which is reflected in its EPS FWD Long-Term Growth Rate [3-5Y CAGR] of 7.33% and its 3-Year dividend growth rate [CAGR] of 15.22%, making it also a candidate for potential inclusion in our dividend portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's P/E GAAP [FWD] Ratio is at 16.67, which is significantly below the sector median of 20.12, demonstrating that Iberdrola is currently undervalued. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">5.

The company's potential for dividend growth is further underlined by its 14 consecutive years of dividend growth and its 5-Year dividend growth rate [CAGR] of 6.85%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to that, it is worth highlighting the company's attractive valuation, which is reflected in its P/E GAAP [FWD] ratio of 11.38, which stands 54.30% below the sector median and 58.87% below the company's 5-Year Average. This indicates that Merck &amp; Co is presently undervalued.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">7.

Altria</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Altria presently offers investors a free cash flow yield [TTM] of 8.09%.

When I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4453654-airbnb-stock-outlook-post-pandemic-era\">first turned bullish</a> on Airbnb, Inc. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB\" title=\"Airbnb, Inc.\">ABNB</a></span>) in September 2021, I was banking on the post-pandemic travel boom to drive revenue and earnings<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> growth higher. Although this expectation has indeed materialized, in hindsight, it is evident that Mr. Market had already priced this into the company's valuation. Since my first buy call, ABNB stock is down ~21%, which is not a pleasant sight given how the S&amp;P 500 has delivered stellar returns during the same period. I, of course, invested in ABNB as the stock retreated so my cost is around $125 per share today, and I am hardly at the breakeven point today.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With Airbnb expected to release Q3 earnings on November 6, exactly from a week from this writing, I wanted to take a step back to evaluate why the stock has gone nowhere for several years despite robust earnings growth (from a loss of $352 million in 2021, Airbnb has come a long way to report a profit of $2.63 billion in the past 12 months). What I found was that I had been too early to bet on the company's diversification efforts. In many of my follow-up articles since the initial buy call, which you can find <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4633861-airbnb-maintaining-my-bullish-stance-in-the-face-of-new-challenges\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4647093-airbnb-short-term-peak-in-demand-in\">here</a>, I discussed why I thought Airbnb's growth would accelerate as the company expands into ancillary services similar to how Booking Holdings Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BKNG\" title=\"Booking Holdings Inc.\">BKNG</a>) did. This is what I got wrong in the past 4+ years. Airbnb could never execute this strategy to perfection, and what we saw was a deceleration in revenue growth, which spooked Mr. Market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Exhibit 1: Airbnb annual revenue growth</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1986\" data-height=\"790\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Airbnb annual revenue growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"255\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While growth decelerated, Airbnb shifted its focus to improving profitability. This is not a bad outcome, of course, but the market was not willing to reward Airbnb with premium valuation multiples while growth moderated, rightly so. Sooner rather than later, you want high-growth companies to turn profitable but not at the cost of growth. Airbnb has turned into a cash flow machine (TTM FCF of $4.28 billion). Some of these cash flows have been used to return capital to shareholders as well (TTM stock repurchases worth $3.7 billion).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are all signs of a business that is growing profitably, but without an acceleration in revenue growth, I believe ABNB stock will trade sideways for the foreseeable future. This is why, in my opinion, the upcoming Q3 report will be a pivotal moment for ABNB as the management is expected to reveal the progress of the Airbnb Services business that was launched last May along with the redesign of the Experiences platform, provide new numbers to evaluate the growth in expansion markets, and also give color on the progress of integrating hotel booking into the Airbnb app.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Look Beyond Just Headline Numbers To Assess Airbnb's Growth Potential</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Airbnb is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly\">expected to report</a> $2.32 in EPS for Q3 on revenue of $4.08 billion. The company has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB/earnings/eps-surprise-summary?period=quarterly\">topped analyst expectations</a> for EPS on each of the past 3 quarters, but as illustrated below, the magnitude of these surprises has been well below the average seen in 2022 and 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Exhibit 2: Airbnb earnings surprise history</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1956\" data-height=\"878\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Airbnb earnings surprise history\" width=\"640\" height=\"287\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although an earnings surprise (or the lack of it) could indeed move ABNB stock in post-earnings trading, as a long-term-oriented investor, I am more interested in deciphering whether Airbnb's growth is likely to accelerate in the foreseeable future or remain under pressure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, a reacceleration in growth hinges on three important factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the short to medium term, whether we see an acceleration of revenue growth will be largely determined by the success of Airbnb's international expansion plans. In Q2, the management revealed that Airbnb's expansion markets (the likes of Japan and Brazil) are seeing much faster growth in nights booked compared to its core markets (U.S., UK, Canada, etc.). Commenting on the <a href=\"https://s26.q4cdn.com/656283129/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Airbnb_Q2-2025-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">fast growth observed in expansion markets</a>, CEO Brian Chesky wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>For six consecutive quarters, nights booked on an origin basis in our expansion markets have grown at about twice the rate of our core markets. This sustained growth is a result of our focus on achieving product-market fit, increasing brand awareness, and driving traffic in key countries.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Later in the shareholder letter, CEO Chesky revealed that both demand and supply in expansion markets grew at more than double the pace at which they grew in core markets in Q2. When Airbnb reports Q3 earnings next week, I will be paying close attention to these metrics to see if this trend continues in the third quarter as well. Given that Airbnb's core markets are seeing a moderation in growth, expansion markets hold the key to driving overall profitability and revenue growth higher in the next 4-6 quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Airbnb's focus on expansion markets seems timely given that industry experts project these markets to grow at a faster clip than well-established core markets. Boston Consulting Group <a href=\"https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/the-15-trillion-opportunity-in-leisure-travel\" rel=\"nofollow\">expects to see the biggest gains</a> in countries such as China, India, and Vietnam in the next 12 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Exhibit 3: Leisure trip destinations booked in the past 12 months and expectations for growth</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://web-assets.bcg.com/dims4/default/9befc52/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2998+0+0/resize/768x640!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fboston-consulting-group-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2F78%2F637a79584b15af2e00cd5fbb8c6a%2Ftraveler-of-the-future-ex02.png\" alt=\"Leisure trip destinations booked in the past 12 months and expectations for growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Boston Consulting Group</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As long as we are seeing continued growth in nights booked in expansion markets, I would be comfortable with my ABNB investment as I believe this would buy the company sufficient time to invest in two other growth engines—hotels and services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When we expand our timeline from the next 4 quarters to the next 2 years, I believe the most important growth driver will be Airbnb's hotel push. Back in 2019, <a href=\"https://news.airbnb.com/hoteltonight-and-airbnb-finalize-acquisition/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Airbnb acquired HotelTonight</a> to expand into the hotel booking sector. However, until recently, we did not see an aggressive push by the company to take market share from industry leaders in this space. That is changing now. Airbnb is now planning to add a new hotel interface into its app, finally delivering on its 2019 promise to directly compete with industry leaders in this space such as Booking.com. Speaking at the Skift Global Forum last month, <a href=\"https://www.phocuswire.com/brian-chesky-hotel-interface-airbnb\" rel=\"nofollow\">CEO Chesky said</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The concrete thing is we are now getting serious about hotels. We bought HotelTonight. We always had intended to integrate it into Airbnb. Then the pandemic hit, and similar to Experiences, we put everything on hold.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Commenting further on this upcoming hotel integration, CEO Chesky confirmed that the company is planning to give travelers the option to book a wide variety of hotel options within the Airbnb app, including boutique hotels, star-class hotel chains, and independent hotels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The hotel booking market adds a massive new opportunity for Airbnb. According to Bernstein analysts, the hotel booking market is <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/deep-dive-on-the-hotel-opportunity-for-airbnb-4229398\" rel=\"nofollow\">approximately 9 times bigger</a> than the short-term rentals market. CEO Chesky has already discussed how travelers use different apps to book hotels when they can't find something suitable on Airbnb, so the company is setting up the stage to keep these travelers within their ecosystem by integrating hotel booking into the app. I believe this will be one of the biggest revenue growth drivers in the next 2 years. For this reason, when Airbnb reports Q3 earnings, I will be paying close attention to management commentary about how these integration plans are moving forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the long term (think of 3+years), the services segment could turn out to be a massive growth driver for Airbnb if the expansion strategy is executed to perfection. Airbnb's goal is to set up the services business as a standalone unit where a traveler does not necessarily have to book an Airbnb stay to avail these services. Last May, the company <a href=\"https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-2025-summer-release/\" rel=\"nofollow\">launched 10 different categories</a> of services including chefs, photography, and spa treatments. In Q3 commentary, the management is likely to discuss the initial market response to these services. During the Q2 earnings call, the management revealed some promising numbers such as a 4.9-star rating for new offerings but the services business had just launched back then. Maintaining a similar level of positive ratings during Q3 should be considered a massive green flag for the future of this segment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am looking forward to Airbnb's Q3 earnings release as I believe management commentary (both in the shareholder letter and during the earnings call) will be full of interesting data points that paint a good picture of the company's growth potential. Without a reacceleration in revenue growth, I believe ABNB stock will continue to deliver lackluster returns as an expansion in valuation multiples cannot be expected just because the company is turning into a cash-flow machine. Given the valuation risks faced by the company, I am maintaining my neutral stance on ABNB ahead of the Q3 earnings print, but I may turn bullish even at these prices if the company gives me reason to be optimistic about the probability of an acceleration in growth in the next few quarters.</p>",

Things like this tend to please the market, which ends up being rewarded with re-ratings. This increase in recurring sales should soften the company's total sales because, as we will see below, the ratings segment can be somewhat cyclical.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are two main reasons for this, which we will look at in more detail later.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. The zero capacity for capital reinvestment on the Ratings side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. The acquisitions made in Analytics in recent years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2022, there was a significant increase in the Analytics segment, from 39% to 51% of sales. This is due to a major acquisition in this segment. On the capital allocation side we will see how they have done several of these in recent years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In any case, the 70% EBIT margin of MIS vs. 31% of MA (although also expanding) means that ratings represent 54% of sales but 70% of EBIT.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"886\" data-height=\"647\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Moody's Revenues\" width=\"640\" height=\"467\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author's representation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Moody's Investors Services (MIS)</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moody's ratings are divided into several types depending on the type of issuer, although corporate (company) bonds clearly predominate.

From 2021 to the end of 2022, you can see how each quarter they were getting less sales than in the previous quarter, the result of declines in issuance volumes due to the abrupt and massive rise in interest rates that was experienced in 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In general, debt tends to be issued in what are called \"issuance waves\", but every wave generates a subsequent undertow, which we will see in the \"refinancing wall\" part.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The good thing about credit ratings is that companies tend to use more than one rating provider for the same issue, so we can say that the services of Moody's and S&amp;P Global Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPGI\" title=\"S&amp;P Global Inc.\">SPGI</a>) are not mutually exclusive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The summary of this segment is that it is an oligopoly with 70% margins in a non-exclusive market.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Moody's Analytics (MA)</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moody's Analytics offers a wide range of risk-related data and analytical content, including credit research, quantitative credit ratings, economic research, business intelligence, know-your-customer tools, commercial real estate data, training services, ESG and risk management software for financial institutions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Debt investors are looking for analytics to understand risks such as credit and counterparty risk. Moody's offers tools that predict the probability of default and provide real-time ratings, as well as early warnings and historical data going back to the 1970s. All of this allows for accurate debt pricing and valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And in some cases, this credit data can have a history of up to 100 years, something irreplicable for any new competitor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In any case, this is a much more highly competitive segment, which we see tending to grow by acquisitions.

They have been doing this for 3 years and when they return to more normal figures (3% of sales), it could be a good leap for FCF.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"886\" data-height=\"600\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ROIC and Reinvestment Rate\" width=\"640\" height=\"433\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617501890332859_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author's Representation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These were Moody's results.

However, impeccable management of operating expenses has played a key role in this margin increase. They are up 1% vs. +11% in sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recurring revenues, which represent 96% of Moody's Analytics (MA) total revenues, grew by 11% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic and constant exchange rate basis. Transaction revenues declined 19%, reflecting MA's continued strategic shift to subscription-based solutions. The good news is that recurrence on the Ratings side is already 69% as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this data is very good overall, but I feel like talking about the Q3 results to link directly to the next section on risks, as I think they did a brilliant exposition of them in the call.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the stock now seems to be suffering from a possible AI risk on the Analytics side, we will see how that risk is quite unlikely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, large US banks are incorporating their models and data into internal AI-based workflows. In fact, they signed a $3 million-plus contract with a Tier 1 bank in the U.S., which will use their tools to automate credit reports and deploy early warning systems in real estate portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its AI strategy has several layers. The first is an internal platform that allows all employees to build AI agents to redesign processes and gain productivity. Added to this is their \"AI Studio Factory,\" focused on developing agentic products (basically, intelligent agents that use their own data and APIs).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I also don't see the risk of regulation as very likely. I mean, sure at some point it will be tried, but if they are doing better than in the 2008 crisis, it is not difficult and hopefully they have learned the lesson, their Ratings system is something that works well globally; I don't see the incentives or the way to change that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other major risk is, directly, already something almost impossible and would put an end to the thesis of gold and Bitcoin, a deleveraging and good economic and budgeting, globally. A utopia. Although a period like this was lived from WWII to 1970.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Half related to this, however, is the risk of the growth of private markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When a company uses the private credit market, it accesses financing through private loans, does not issue public bonds and, therefore, does not need a credit rating. In these cases, institutional investors conduct their own risk analysis without resorting to agencies such as Moody's. This means that, as the company's credit rating increases, it will be able to make its own risk analysis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This means that, as private credit gains ground, the volume of government debt requiring a rating decreases, potentially reducing Moody's core business. CEO Robert Fauber himself explained that the alliance with MSCI stems precisely from the need to offer an independent assessment of private credit risk. It seeks to add value from another angle: helping investors to understand and compare risk with a \"trusted third party\" view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although on the call they commented that they are starting to see some flow back from private credit into the public markets, mainly because coupons in the public market are significantly cheaper than private financing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While not an immediate threat, it is a gradual and sustained pressure on their traditional revenue model.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This valuation method effectively combines a sort of multiples-based valuation, the minimum required rates of return for the stock, and the total return shareholders can achieve in the form of dividends and share buybacks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using 2024 FCF as a starting point, I believe that both of Moody's segments can grow at high single-digit rates. The MIS segment is driven by refinancing wall volumes and annual price increases in the order of 4% and the MA segment, I believe, can have organic growths of 5% plus a few extra points inorganically. With the use of AI these companies are becoming much more efficient businesses with the ability to increase margins. So, I think FCF will be able to grow at rates of 12% in a base case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we assume an exit multiple of 30x and discount the future value at a minimum required internal rate of return of 12%, factoring in projected dividends and the estimated stock price in 2029, we calculate a fair value of $460 per share. This price would ensure achieving the minimum 12% return over the next 5 years if these assumptions hold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For all these reasons, I rate the stock as a hold, as it is currently trading at 490$.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"948\" data-height=\"193\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"130\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author's Representation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moody's strikes me as a fantastic business, which the market may be unfairly penalizing because of ill-founded fears around AI in its Moody's Analytics segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This could create buying opportunities in the company that could benefit long-term investors who understand the business well.

Joining me now to discuss the latest decision is Francis Fong, Senior Economist with TD Bank Group.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And Francis, what's your reaction to the decision? Any surprises here?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Francis Fong:</strong> Yeah, first of all, thanks for having me back, Anthony. Always great to be here. So no surprises in this decision. I think this was a widely expected rate cut. If we look at where the growth picture has come in, where the inflation data has come in, where the unemployment rate or the employment data has come in, a lot of it has pointed to additional space for the bank to lower rates and support that overall economy. We've seen quite a lot of weakness in areas like exports, investment, whereas we've seen maybe a bit of resilience on the consumer spending side, but enough so that the Bank could provide that additional cut. So yeah, no surprises there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Now, the big question is, does this latest cut mark the end of the Bank of Canada's easing cycle?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Francis Fong:</strong> Yeah, and I think this sort of follows where the economic profile is going to be in the next few quarters. We do anticipate that second-quarter growth, which was quite weak in a lot of key areas. We do expect that to be the bottom in growth. We're already seeing the kind of Q3 growth picture's come back a little bit, though perhaps not as strong as some would like. And so that should provide some basis for the Bank of Canada to remain on hold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I mean, at 2.25%, we're already talking about where the Bank of Canada sort of finds the neutral rate. And so I believe the bank is quite comfortable where they are. And they actually did communicate that, so long as the economy progresses how they envision it-- and so far, the data is of lining up with that-- this is likely where they're going to keep the floor. So they've already choreographed that well. So absent any kind of surprise on the downside or, in fact, the upside, this is likely where we're going to see rates for the medium term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> I think one area that there's a lot of uncertainty right now remains tariffs and the lack of a deal between the US and Canada. Now, big question-- what happens if we don't reach a deal, and what are the implications for monetary policy?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Francis Fong:</strong> That's a great question, Anthony. And I think this is obviously where there is quite a lot of uncertainty because if you read the headlines, and you read the headlines alone, it will give you the impression that things are in a very dire state. Obviously, we just sort of had a potential trade deal fall through, according to Prime Minister Carney. And so that kind of leaves a lot of folks with a lot of uncertainty. I think if you dig into the Bank of Canada's Monetary Policy Report and even in our own forecast, we do embed an actual tariff assumption in those forecasts. Bank of Canada, for example, has an average tariff rate of about 6%, as of their October Monetary Policy Report. That is a far cry from the big double-digit numbers that, for example, Trump is talking about and things of that nature. That's the actual one that we see.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But on the same token, that is not felt evenly across the country. That 6% is really a reflection of the much higher tariff rate we're seeing on steel and aluminum, on non-CUSMA compliant autos, softwood lumber, things of that nature. So we do see some higher sectoral impacts, whereas the actual average tariff rate is quite modest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So what that means is there's still going to be uncertainty going forward because that 6% tariff rate is being felt in some parts of the economy. So we're still hoping for that deal to sort of remove that sort of uncertainty. But if no trade deal takes place, we're sort of where we are today, which is sort of a major headwind. But we're still seeing some resilience behind the scenes in areas that are not so hard hit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Alright, now, we also have the upcoming federal budget soon. What are your thoughts on that? And what implications, if any, will that have on Bank of Canada policy going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Francis Fong:</strong> So I mentioned the neutral rate a little bit earlier. I think that's really where we're going to see the impact of where the Bank of Canada thinks the Canadian economy is going to be long term because all the conversations around the federal budget, everything that Mark Carney is talking about right now, is around, how do we reorient the Canadian economy away from a trading partner, a primary trading partner, that is perhaps less reliable than it has been in the past.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> So how do we create those new trade routes in between the country or within the country and, of course, across the Pacific and across the Atlantic? That requires huge investments in everything from trade infrastructure, transportation infrastructure, making our firms more competitive in those markets that previously we haven't really had to compete in up until now. So what does that picture look like?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Francis Fong:</strong> So where we're looking for more clarity and more guidance is what are those investments that we're going to make. Obviously, we're already hearing things about major projects and things of that nature. But beyond that, how are we establishing ourselves in those markets, and will it work? And of course, that has implications for what the trend rate of the overnight rate will look like. And so there's implications there. But in the short term, it's likely not going to have too, too much of an impact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Alright, so given this latest decision, how do you expect the loonie to perform going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Francis Fong:</strong> So I think the narrative around loonie has been difficult to parse. Up to or sort of over the last year, we've really seen the Canadian dollar be part of this broader narrative around US dollar weakness across many of its trading partners. And that's driven a lot of the dynamics over the last year or so. Lately, I think we've seen more divergence among advanced economies relative to the US dollar, where it's short-rate differentials. So given that the Canadian economy has performed, I think, relatively weaker than a lot of our advanced counterparts, and that's obviously, especially true given our reliance on the US, there's been some more pronounced weakness relative to some others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But we do anticipate that, as the economic profile improves over time, and we start to see that growth picture get a little better, we're already seeing some upside surprises on the employment side, on the inflation side. All of that, I think, will contribute to some US-- sorry, some Canadian dollar strengthening. And we do anticipate it to strengthen from here to about $0.75, sort of towards late next year and through our medium-term forecast horizon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Now, you talked about inflation. You talked about jobs. Are there any things, key reports that you'll be watching closely to get a sense of how the Canadian economy will perform over the longer term?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Francis Fong:</strong> I mean, there's-- that's a complicated question. There's a lot of data we're looking at. Obviously, growth, inflation, and employment, the obvious ones that we'll be keeping an eye on because there's been quite a bit of volatility, driven, no doubt, by the uncertainty that firms and individuals are facing. But on top of that, we're really going to be looking at the political side, what's coming out of this budget, how does that set us up long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And we're going to be looking at a lot of individual components of GDP. For example, how does the trade picture improve? We saw a massive decline in real exports, particular, 32% annualized reduction in real goods exports. How does that trade picture improve? All of that, I think, contributes to how is the Canadian economy staying resilient in the face of this new threat, and how do we evolve going forward, so lots of data that we're keeping an eye on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Francis, thanks for your time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Francis Fong:</strong> Always a pleasure, Anthony. </p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.moneytalkgo.com/video/bank-of-canada-cuts-rate-to-2-25-in-second-straight-drop/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p>",

With a market capitalization of $6.19 billion as of this writing, and a good track record for growth under<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> its belt, it is certainly an intriguing prospect. On top of this, shares of the business trade on the cheap, and leverage is lower than what we see with most other similar enterprises. Currently, the housing market is undergoing significant stress. And that is something that investors should continue to monitor closely. This is especially true when you consider that firms such as this are finally starting to see some pain from that weakness. But given how cheap shares are, because of its overall financial position, and because my expectation that the long-term picture for the housing industry will eventually improve, I believe that now is actually a great time to upgrade the company from a \"Buy\" to a \"Strong Buy.\"</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Great Play In Housing</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fundamentally speaking, things are not going exactly great for shareholders of Taylor Morrison Home Corporation.

In the image above, you can see how the median price of a new home sold has been on the decline for a few years now. This is because of inflationary pressures and high-interest rates aimed at combating them. Unfortunately, because of the government shutdown, we don't have the most up-to-date data here. But <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/current/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/current/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">we do know</a> that, as of August, of this year, the number of housing completions was 8.4% lower than it was a year earlier. The number of housing starts was down 6%, while building permits were down 11.1%. As I have written about in other articles, such as here and here, I firmly believe that the U.S. economy is barreling toward a recession. So in the short term, I fully expect these conditions to worsen.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2170\" data-height=\"900\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"265\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"265\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079461164024_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because of the time lag between when market conditions change and when homebuilders ultimately deliver their homes, we are just now seeing some of the weakness that Taylor Morrison Home Corporation was destined to see.

That's down from the $2.12 billion that the company reported a year earlier. This was driven by a decline in the number of homes closed from 3,394 to 3,324, which more than offset a rise in the average price of a home from $598,000 last year to $602,000 this year. However, for the first nine months of this year in its entirety, the number of homes closed was up, while the average price was down slightly. The chart above illustrates this. And that, clearly, helped to push revenue for the first nine months of this year up compared to the same time last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This recent decrease in sales had a deleterious impact on the company's bottom line. Net income contracted from $251.1 million to $201.4 million. But that's not all. While operating cash flow did skyrocket from $135.9 million to $219.6 million, we saw this metric, adjusted for changes in working capital, fall from $264.7 million to $257 million. Meanwhile, EBITDA for the company contracted from $379.2 million to $333.1 million. Although net profits are down for this year in its entirety, all other cash flow metrics for the company have improved, which means that the problems seen in the most recent quarter are new. In fact, management, while acknowledging broader economic conditions that have delayed the purchase of homes, mentioned that the company has been offering even greater incentives and discounts to drive buying activity.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2014\" data-height=\"872\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"277\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"277\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616079950058246_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1894\" data-height=\"900\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"304\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"304\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-1761608014013421_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These discounts have been reflected in net new orders for the institution. In the most recent quarter, the company saw net new orders amounting to 2,468 homes. That's down 12.8% from the 2,830 homes ordered a year earlier. At the same time as this occurred, the average price of a home ordered contracted from $587,000 to $567,000. Unlike what we saw in revenue, this is not a new trend. In fact, as the chart above illustrates, net new orders and average prices for new homes ordered have both contracted year over year for the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same time of 2024. The company is also seeing a rise in its cancellation rate, with an increase from 9.3% in the third quarter of last year to 15.4% this year. This is evidence that the buyers of its homes are becoming increasingly pressured by difficult market conditions.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2058\" data-height=\"886\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"276\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"276\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616080259884999_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the chart above, you can see the impact that prior large home deliveries, and weaker net new orders, have had on the company's backlog.

With these estimates, we can see in the chart above how shares of the company are currently valued. Obviously, this does not capture the prospect of additional weakening in the market. But considering how cheap the stock is, even with the picture worsening, shares could still be quite appealing. This is true not only on an absolute basis, but relative to other similar firms as well. In the table below, I stacked Taylor Morrison Home Corporation up against five other similar enterprises. On a price-to-earnings basis, two of the firms are cheaper than it is, while another is tied with it. But when it comes to the other two valuation approaches, our prospect is the cheapest of the group.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><strong>Company</strong></td> <td><strong>Price / Earnings</strong></td> <td><strong>Price / Operating Cash Flow</strong></td> <td><strong>EV / EBITDA</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Taylor Morrison Home Corporation</strong></td> <td><strong>7.4</strong></td> <td><strong>5.7</strong></td> <td><strong>5.7</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Hovnanian Enterprises (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HOV\" title=\"Hovnanian Enterprises, Inc.\">HOV</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>6.3</strong></td> <td><strong>6.4</strong></td> <td><strong>8.1</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Meritage Homes (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTH\" title=\"Meritage Homes Corporation\">MTH</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>6.2</strong></td> <td><strong>19.1</strong></td> <td><strong>7.5</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Century Communities (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCS\" title=\"Century Communities, Inc.\">CCS</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>7.4</strong></td> <td><strong>13.1</strong></td> <td><strong>11.9</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Beazer Homes USA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BZH\" title=\"Beazer Homes USA, Inc.\">BZH</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>10.7</strong></td> <td><strong>25.9</strong></td> <td><strong>20.1</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>KB Home (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KBH\" title=\"KB Home\">KBH</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>8.8</strong></td> <td><strong>11.4</strong></td> <td><strong>8.5</strong></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another advantage that Taylor Morrison Home Corporation has over most of its competitors is leverage. The firm has net debt of only $1.82 billion right now. In the chart below, you can see that this translates to a net leverage ratio of 1.30. That's below four of the five institutions that I stacked it up against. In fact, I would argue that it is substantially lower than these other four players. That provides the company additional flexibility and optionality, especially in a down market. So I don't have any concern about the long-term viability of the business.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1910\" data-height=\"904\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Net Debt / EBITDA\" width=\"640\" height=\"303\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"303\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/9866571-17616081728501883_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the short run, I do remain concerned about market conditions. According to one <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500367-ubs-u-s-lumber-tariffs-could-add-8900-to-cost-of-building-a-home\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500367-ubs-u-s-lumber-tariffs-could-add-8900-to-cost-of-building-a-home\" target=\"_blank\">source</a>, the newest tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration will raise the cost of the average home by $8,900. And that does not even factor in any potential ramifications from the newest 10% tariff imposed on Canada by the U<span>nited States</span>. Considering that Canada <a href=\"https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/2025/01/us-lumber-market-trump-administration/#:~:text=Compared%20to%20the%2028.1%20million,growing%20and%20conserving%20our%20forests.%E2%80%9D\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://cnr.ncsu.edu/news/2025/01/us-lumber-market-trump-administration/#:~:text=Compared%20to%20the%2028.1%20million,growing%20and%20conserving%20our%20forests.%E2%80%9D\" target=\"_blank\">supplies</a> about 24% of US softwood lumber consumption for the United States, and that this works out to as much as 85% of all U.S. softwood lumber imports, we could have additional costs stemming from this decision. But the good news is that, earlier this year, <strong>Zillow</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/Z\" title=\"Zillow Group, Inc.\">Z</a>) <a href=\"https://nationalmortgageprofessional.com/news/us-housing-shortage-hits-record-high-analysis\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://nationalmortgageprofessional.com/news/us-housing-shortage-hits-record-high-analysis\" target=\"_blank\">estimated</a> that there exists a housing deficit of 4.7 million homes nationwide. This is actually a record high despite a five-year construction boom.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For several years now, the U<span>nited States</span> has been underbuilding. So even with a surge of construction activity, the preexisting shortage and a continued growth of the U.S. population caused this shortage to balloon. At some point, the combination of additional population growth and some of the 8.1 million families that are now sharing homes with non-relatives, will eventually hit a breaking point and push buying activity up, but perhaps only after a recession and a big decline in interest rates. When that does happen, Taylor Morrison Home Corporation will be in a prime position to benefit.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on all the data currently available, I still believe that while market conditions could worsen in the near term, Taylor Morrison Home Corporation is in a good spot. The firm is cheap, and the overall risk profile of it is low. When you consider long-term trends, this bodes well for shareholders. So at the end of the day, I firmly believe that increasing my rating from a \"Buy\" to a \"Strong Buy\" makes sense.</p>",

This followed the divestment of non-core business activities in the years before. Ever since, shares have lost about 30% in the time<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> frame of a quarter, while the market at large has been trading fairly stable.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This has certainly improved appeal, as the company announced an interesting acquisition as well. Right now, valuations have been compressed quite a bit, but still mark a substantial premium to the overall market, although that I am inclined to buy the dip below the $200 mark.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data Analytics Play</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Verisk is a provider of key data analytics functions in the global insurance industry, which in itself includes various segments like life &amp; annuity, auto, property, casualty, weather events, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its role is that of strategic data analytics and technology partner in order to provide insights to its client base, which use such data for underwriting and claims. These insights allow them to make more informed decisions, which is key given the amounts involved with such underwriting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Verisk generates about $3 billion in sales from providing such services with EBITDA margins exceeding 50% of sales, an impressive result for a completely focused business with retention rates close to 100%. Some 70% of its sales are generated by underwriting solutions, with the remainder of revenues coming from claim solutions. In all, some 80% of sales are generated in North America, with the remainder of revenues generated abroad.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Becoming A Focused Business</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Up to a couple of years ago, the company has a smaller energy segment and financial service industry activity as well, yet it has divested these assets in recent years. The completely focused business posted a 7% increase in sales, both in 2023 and 2024, with revenues last year reported up to nearly $2.9 billion. The company reported EBITDA near $1.6 billion, translating into truly remarkable margins, with adjusted earnings reported at $6.64 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the year 2025, the company initially saw sales up to a midpoint of $3.05 billion, with adjusted earnings seen a couple pennies short of the $7 per share mark. Trading at $303 in July, as the company was awarded a $45 billion enterprise valuation, equal to 15 times sales, valuing equity at a mid-forty times earnings multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That was not about to change following a $162 million bolt-on deal announced for SuranceBay over the summer, and while the performance of the business was impressive, an earnings yield in the low 2s was simply too low to see appeal.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Coming Down</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the summer, share of Verisk have seen quite a setback, now trading down 20% to $208 per share, levels first seen in the summer of 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fall started by the end of July, when the company announced both second quarter <a href=\"https://investor.verisk.com/News--Events-/Press-Releases--Market-Info/news-details/2025/Verisk-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">results</a>, and announced a substantial acquisition. Second quarter sales were up 8% in a steady fashion to $773 million. The company hiked the midpoint of the sales guidance to $3.11 billion, aided by a weaker dollar, but at the same time trimmed the full year earnings guidance by five cents to a midpoint of $6.90 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net debt stood at $2.6 billion as 140 million shares outstanding make for a $34.0 billion equity valuation and $36.6 billion enterprise valuation. This reduces sales multiples to about 12 times, with earnings trading at a 35 times multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, Verisk announced a substantial $2.35 billion <a href=\"https://s29.q4cdn.com/767340216/files/doc_presentations/2025/Sep/Verisk-Announces-the-Acquisitions-of-AccuLynx-and-SuranceBay.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">purchase</a> of AccuLynx, with the company being a leading SAAS platform which provides end-to-end management workflows for residential property contractors. The company really focuses on all information in such projects, while providing key links between insurers, contractors, suppliers and third party administrators.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The purchase does not come cheap. The company, which has been founded in 2018, generates about $150 million in annual sales. This suggests that a premium 15 times sales multiple has been paid, although that its sales are seen up mid-to double-digits. The 55% EBITDA margins are in line with margins reported by Verisk itself. This will double net debt essentially to $5 billion, still manageable, for a net leverage ratio in the mid to-higher 2s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors gotten a bit spooked as shares fell by another 10% towards the end of October, when Verisk <a href=\"https://investor.verisk.com/News--Events-/Press-Releases--Market-Info/news-details/2025/Verisk-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> a ¨mere¨ 5.5% increase in organic constant currency sales for the third quarter. Worse, slower growth came amidst margin pressure as well, with adjusted earnings up just 3% to $1.72 per share. While the company maintains its full year $6.80-$7.00 adjusted earnings per share outlook, the full year sales outlook has been trimmed by $40-$50 million here, trending closer to the original outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This continued fall in the share price made that earnings multiples compressed further to 30 times, which is a lot more compelling than this summer, but still rather demanding.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">And Now?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the deal for AccuLynx taking place at a substantial premium, it is easy to become a bit more cautious, also as organic growth is slowing down. High valuations and a subsequent 30% pullback have reduced earnings multiples from the mid-forties to thirty times. This has pushed up the earnings yield from a low 2% to the low 3s%, which is compelling, but still demanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Verisk is a very strong business, one which I have great admiration for, as the move has certainly improved appeal a great deal. The question is if current multiples in the low-thirties are compelling enough, now also given the leveraged up balance sheet, as frankly I need a bigger margin of safety here.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, I am watching this development unfold with great interest, looking to get involved at levels towards below $200 mark. I fully recognize the risk that I might not see such levels as the market rightfully awards premium multiple to a premium business for a long time already, with the risk-reward gradually becoming more balanced here.</p>",

Beyond injectables, Metsera boasts ultra-long-acting oral GLP-1 peptides that aim for injectable-like efficacy at lower doses to curtail manufacturing and scaling hurdles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to its investigational assets, Metsera is grounded on its <a href=\"https://metsera.com/science/\" rel=\"nofollow\">platform</a>: HALO (lipidation), MOMENTUM (oral delivery), and MINT (a library of 20,000 NuSH analogs from two decades of work).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, it’s easy to see why big pharmaceutical companies are, figuratively speaking, fighting over it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It all started when Metsera signed a <a href=\"https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-acquire-metsera-and-its-next-generation-obesity\" rel=\"nofollow\">deal</a> with Pfizer on September 22, 2025, for $47.50 cash plus $22.50 CVR (up to ~$7.3 billion). Earlier today, Novo Nordisk launched an <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/novo-nordisk-makes-unsolicited-offer-metsera-2025-10-30/\" rel=\"nofollow\">unsolicited bid</a> valuing Metsera up to ~$9 billion. Immediately following, Pfizer <a href=\"https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-addresses-proposal-metsera\" rel=\"nofollow\">fired back</a>, calling Novo Nordisk’s bid “unprecedented,” “reckless,” and “in violation of law.” Metsera then <a href=\"https://investors.metsera.com/news-releases/news-release-details/metsera-receives-unsolicited-proposal-novo-nordisk\" rel=\"nofollow\">declared</a> Novo Nordisk’s proposal as “superior.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following the hoopla, Metsera’s stock climbed ~20% to ~$63.50 (intraday).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_48acaa743d5f95a2be3e43749b0d227f.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_48acaa743d5f95a2be3e43749b0d227f.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_48acaa743d5f95a2be3e43749b0d227f.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_48acaa743d5f95a2be3e43749b0d227f.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_48acaa743d5f95a2be3e43749b0d227f.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_48acaa743d5f95a2be3e43749b0d227f.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_48acaa743d5f95a2be3e43749b0d227f.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_48acaa743d5f95a2be3e43749b0d227f.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_48acaa743d5f95a2be3e43749b0d227f.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The article that follows takes a closer look at the developments and uncovers what’s ahead for Metsera investors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's In It For Metsera</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, let’s begin by laying out the two deals side-by-side.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table class=\"table-striped\"> <thead><tr class=\"bg-gn\"> <td><p>Item</p></td> <td><p>Pfizer (signed merger)</p></td> <td><p>Novo Nordisk (unsolicited; deemed “Superior”)</p></td> </tr></thead> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p>Headline value (max)</p></td> <td><p>Up to $70.00/share</p></td> <td><p>Up to $77.75/share</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Up-front cash to holders</p></td> <td><p>$47.50/share at closing</p></td> <td><p>Two-step: NVO pays $56.50/share to MTSR; MTSR issues NVO 50% non-voting preferred; same day, MTSR declares a $56.50/share cash dividend, paid ~10 days later</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Contingent value right (CVR)</p></td> <td><p>Up to $22.50/share tied to specified dev./approval milestones</p></td> <td><p>Up to $21.25/share CVR with milestones “substantially similar” to Pfizer CVR</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Board stance</p></td> <td><p>The board still recommends approving the Pfizer merger</p></td> <td><p>The board has delivered a “Superior Proposal” notice to Pfizer</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Match/negotiation window</p></td> <td> </td> <td><p>4 business days for Pfizer to negotiate terms so Novo no longer “Superior,” although Pfizer believes Metsera had no right to deliver “Superior” notice</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this context, Metsera’s current price of ~$63.50 is a risk-adjusted, time-discounted price across scenarios. The three most likely scenarios are as follows:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Pfizer ups/matches and wins (60-70% likely).</p></li> <li><p>Novo signs and ultimately pays up to $77.75 (25-35%).</p></li> <li><p>Break (≤5%).</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why is Metsera’s stock 20% higher today? For starters, the max consideration rose ~11%. Moreover, a real rival bid and “Superior” designation increase the probability that some deal closes. Lastly, there’s now credible overbid/match potential from Pfizer. Essentially, the market is pricing in a modestly sweetened deal by Pfizer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While existing Metsera investors are “sitting pretty,” I don’t see much opportunity for “arbitrage” for prospective investors, especially as the process may drag (Pfizer disputes “Superior” notice; Novo Nordisk faces higher antitrust scrutiny).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Metsera appears structurally incentivized to close with Pfizer. The signed Pfizer agreement is still the governing deal; there may be a credible litigation threat if Metsera pivots to Novo Nordisk, and there is antitrust asymmetry (Novo Nordisk’s obesity dominance with Wegovy). Also, don’t underestimate the weight Boards give to speed and certainty of closure. So, this may not be the case of “highest bidder wins.”</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's In It For Pfizer</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The acquisition would reignite Pfizer’s obesity pipeline, which is noticeably barren following the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4791178-pfizers-oral-obesity-drug-flop-a-symptom-of-a-deeper-pipeline-problem\">danuglipron failure</a>. Given the massive size of the obesity treatment market (near-term estimates are as high as $100 billion), Pfizer is almost obligated to pay up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Novo Nordisk’s bid follows <a href=\"https://investors.metsera.com/news-releases/news-release-details/metsera-reports-positive-phase-2b-results-first-and-best-class\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phase 2b data</a> for Metsera’s MET-097i (monthly), released just days after the Pfizer deal.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>As a fully biased mono-agonist, MET-097i achieved dual-agonist-like weight loss of 14.1% at 28 weeks in VESPER-1, with only 2.9% study discontinuation. In VESPER-3, with two titration steps to the highest dose evaluated, we saw potentially class-leading tolerability with a placebo-like frequency of diarrhea, and a risk difference from placebo of 13% for nausea, and 11% for vomiting. Based on these data, MET-097i is advancing into Phase 3 clinical trials, accelerating its development as the foundational peptide for Metsera’s combination, oral, and prodrug programs.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For context, Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy (weekly) inspired ~14.9% mean weight loss at 68 weeks (<a href=\"https://www.novomedlink.com/content/dam/wegovy/pdf/patient-clinical-support.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">STEP-1</a>) with discontinuation for AEs at 6.8%. Eli Lilly’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY\" title=\"Eli Lilly and Company\">LLY</a>) Zepbound caused ~20-21% mean weight loss at 72 weeks (<a href=\"https://zepbound.lilly.com/hcp/clinical-data-weight\" rel=\"nofollow\">SURMOUNT-1</a>; H2H vs. Wegovy also <a href=\"https://www.lilly.com/en-CA/news/press-releases/2024.12.4-tirzepatide-surmount-5-h2h\" rel=\"nofollow\">superior</a>) with discontinuation AEs ~6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, both Wegovy and Zepbound require once-weekly dosing with multistep titration to mitigate GI AEs. MET-097i is dosed monthly with an encouraging GI AE profile. Should MET-097i confer Wegovy-like efficacy (possibly greater) and low discontinuation in Phase 3, it could have a clear path towards becoming an obesity blockbuster.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's In It For Novo Nordisk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Novo Nordisk’s interest signals that it is bracing for margin/price pressure in the GLP-1 world. Wegovy will not be a blockbuster forever. The onus in biopharma is the need for continuous innovation. Acquiring Metsera delivers a clean, vertically integrated “next-gen” pipeline (amylin/GLP-1 combos) to renew its leadership.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That being said, Novo Nordisk’s <a href=\"https://www.novonordisk.com/science-and-technology/r-d-pipeline.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">obesity pipeline</a> is already dense. However, Metsera now has a late-stage, titration-light, GLP-1 backbone. Moreover, Novo’s combo approach is weekly (CagriSema; amycretin weekly and oral). Whereas, Metsera’s co-formulated GLP-1 + amylin is dosed monthly. Lastly, Metsera’s MOMENTUM platform addresses the API/COGS bottleneck that Novo Nordisk’s oral semaglutide (approval pending in obesity) will certainly suffer from.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To wrap up, Novo Nordisk’s unsolicited bid for Metsera adds both uncertainty and further upside potential for the latter’s shareholders. However, this is already priced in, so any arbitrage potential appears muted. As such, Metsera investors will benefit from staying put until this works itself out (“Hold” rating).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For Pfizer, its press release today, in my view, reeks of desperation. It should remain focused on closing the deal, rather than publicly antagonizing its target. Obviously, both sides (Metsera &amp; Pfizer) are saying different things about what is and isn’t allowed (in terms of other deals). Without the details on my desk, I can only speculate. What I do know is that Pfizer needs Metsera more than anyone else.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Clearly, Novo Nordisk also needs Metsera. Although Wegovy remains a monster in its own right, it is slowly losing ground to Zepbound, and the obesity treatment market in just 3–4 years from now will be very different. To put it simply, Novo Nordisk is at risk of losing its stronghold in obesity, which is why its stock trades the way it does (-55% in the past year).</p>",

Corp. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VFC\" title=\"V.F. Corporation\">VFC</a></span>) is now two years into a turnaround under CEO Bracken Darrell. I've been long the stock for much of this time, and have written bullish articles on SA in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4680202-vf-corp-is-hitting-peak-pessimism\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">March 2024</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4770467-vf-corp-oversold-after-sector-sell-off\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">March 2025</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">, arguing that the market has been too impatient with management's strategy. After another several quarters of operating results in 2025, I'm writing with an update in which I will put this week's results in a slightly longer perspective, and to explain why I have decided to throw in the towel and sell my shares.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think bulls and bears are both only capturing part of the story here. VF's turnaround is working, especially on the operational side (turning around the trajectory of Vans is proving harder than expected), but a combination of inherent difficulties and tariffs is going to mean that the turnaround will take longer than initially expected. Hence, my question: how long are you willing to wait? </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><strong>Recent Financials</strong></span></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the last four quarters, VF management has made measurable progress on improving the company's financial profile. They quickly achieved the first $300 million in cost savings and announced another $500-$600 million more over the next three years. Gross margins have stabilized and operating margins have improved significantly. Meanwhile, the sales of Supreme and now, more recently, Dickie's have brought down debt by almost 50% from $5.7 billion when Darrell began to probably around $2.9 billion after the Dickie's sale is completed. This has not yet led to any sustained drop in interest expenses, but it is definitely a move in the right direction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4b33ce4b70760f2421d213077dfeea89/vfc/db/409/134231/transcript/CORRECTED+TRANSCRIPT_+VF+Corp.%28VFC-US%29%2C+Q2+2026+Earnings+Call%2C+28-October-2025+8_00+AM+ET.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">latest quarter's call</a>, management explained that if they exclude Dickie's, about 70% of the company's brands by revenue are now growing. That is great news, and speaks to the real strength of North Face and Timberland especially. But Vans, the largest brand, continues to suffer. Over the last four quarters, Vans revenue has post YOY drops of -8%, -20%, -15%, and -11%, respectively. Especially in the middle two quarters, management attributed a big part of the drop to store closures in North America. They have basically said that, excluding their own deliberate rebalancing, the drops have been stable in the high single digits. I don't take this as necessarily a negative sign, but it offers us no real evidence of progress on the turnaround.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business Developments</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the earnings calls, Darrell remains exceptionally optimistic and positive about the behind-the-scenes changes going on within the management of VF's brands, especially Vans. The company has been trying to \"premiumize\" the brand more, and has gotten positive feedback on their Warped Tour and Instagram marketing campaigns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But compared with the report in 2024 that SEO results were really improving in Europe, these comments are much less quantitatively solid and rigorous. I remain generally confident that Darrell's turnaround plan makes sense and will work over time, but the tough reality is that Vans is still losing customers. Management has shifted from providing some hard - if small - evidence of improvement in 2024 to saying that \"turnarounds take time\" in 2025. In other words, they are no longer providing a clear timeline for the Vans turnaround. Instead, we hear that the CEO is \"super confident\" that Vans will return to growth (on the Q2 call this week) but also that \"I'm going to keep the expectations low for Vans as long as possible, because I want to give her plenty of room to operate\" (<a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4b33ce4b70760f2421d213077dfeea89/vfc/db/409/127906/transcript/CORRECTED+TRANSCRIPT_+VF+Corp.%28VFC-US%29%2C+Q3+2025+Earnings+Call%2C+29-January-2025+8_00+AM+ET.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">FY25 Q3 call in January</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I appreciate the optimism and think Darrell's team is being reasonable in moderating expectations and working on the actual business, but investors need to plan accordingly. At this point, there is little reason to expect strong revenue growth in 2026. Consensus estimates are for 1% YOY growth for FY26 (ending in March 2027). That seems conservative to me, but I also see little evidence to support more bullishness. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management has put on a good face about tariffs, emphasizing their mitigation strategies and diverse sourcing across Southeast Asia and Latin America, but the reality is that they project the tariffs to cost them about $250-$270 million, mostly in 2026, a figure which they have revised upwards from an initial estimate of $150 million. This is made worse by the fact that the brands have (it seems) very little pricing power. As management explained on the <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_4b33ce4b70760f2421d213077dfeea89/vfc/db/409/132965/transcript/CORRECTED+TRANSCRIPT_+VF+Corp.%28VFC-US%29%2C+Q1+2026+Earnings+Call%2C+30-July-2025+8_00+AM+ET.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q1 call in July</a>, VF's products have an overall price elasticity of about one, meaning that any increase in prices that they pass on to consumers will be met with a proportional drop in sales volume.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, with the business only generating about $400 million in OCF per year over the last two years, this net increase in costs is going to make it much harder to pay down debt, etc. Remember that VF Corp is still paying out about $140 million per year in dividends. So, the tariff costs are going to eat up most of the other cash that the business might have generated to pay down debt and fuel growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock nosedived this spring when the tariffs were announced, from a recent high of $28 all the way down to below $10. Since then, they have of course recovered along with the broader market. But make no mistake, the tariffs are bad news, made worse by VF's limited cash generation ability and high debt burden. I don't see the tariffs going away anytime soon, and so investors need to accordingly moderate their expectations about the speed of the turnaround.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Outlook for Shares</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the wake of this week's earnings report, as shares slide over 10%, analysts updated their forecasts and price targets. The three most highly-rated analysts according to TipRanks are in perfect disagreement:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Sam Poser (Williams Trading): SELL, price target $10</li> <li>Adrienne Yih (Barclays): BUY, price target $18</li> <li><p>John Kernan (TD Cowen): HOLD, price target $15</p></li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the monthly chart below, We can see how those targets match up with recent price action. Shares have seen very strong support (and insider buying) between $9 and $12, but they've failed to reliably break out about $20 or so.

But over the last nine months, there have been two major new headwinds: tariffs and stalling progress at Vans. Over the medium term (say 3-5 years) I remain optimistic about management's ability to revitalize Timberlands, North Face, and Vans, and to stabilize revenue and profitability.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But with shares already trading at over 20x 2026 earnings - a valuation about 20% <em>above </em>the industry average - I think a significant portion of that medium-term improvement is already priced in. In the shorter-term, tariffs, dividends, and revenue declines are going to limit FCF and leave the company's debt levels stubbornly high. It turns out that, as many writers have noted, turnarounds are longer and slower than people usually hope.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CZR\" title=\"Caesars Entertainment, Inc.\">CZR</a></span>) in late July, I thought Caesars' stock looked intriguing. Beneath the headlines, Q2 numbers looked better than the market — which sent CZR on an eleven-session losing streak into<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and out of the report — seemed to believe. And while leverage and the general underperformance of these \"value play or value trap\" consumer names suggested there was little need to rush in, it did seem like shares were worth at least a long look.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third quarter results this week have met with another negative reaction: CZR dropped more than 15% on Wednesday. As with Q2, the headlines seem to support a sell-off. Margins <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509737-caesars-entertainment-gaap-eps-of-0_27-misses-by-0_18-revenue-of-2_87b-misses-by-20m\">clearly disappointed</a> relative to sell-side expectations; headline numbers are notably soft, including an 11% decline in same-store Adjusted EBITDA. This time around, however, a closer look doesn't suggest a report that quietly helps the bull case, but rather one that loudly supports the bear case.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Case For CZR Stock After Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's worth noting up front that this is not a stock where valuation moves change the thesis <em>that</em> much. Capitalizing leases at 8x rent expense, Caesars's market cap is about one-sixth of its enterprise value. The 15% decline in the stock price equates to a roughly 3% fall in EV. Similarly, the multiple assigned here hasn't changed all that much; at least on paper, the shortfall in Q3 EBITDA (probably $40-$50 million relative to consensus as well as my own broad expectations for a low-single-digit/mid-single-digit decline) accounts for close to half today's movement. CZR's EV/EBITDA multiple on Wednesday is about one-tenth of a turn lower than it was at Tuesday's close.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And so it's difficult — I would argue dangerous — to make the case that CZR is simply \"too cheap\". The lease-adjusted enterprise value here still is over $25 billion; a ~7x EV/EBITDA multiple is not <em>that</em> great for a leveraged cyclical facing very real risks. Instead, the bull case here needs to at least some degree be based on the underlying business, and at the moment likely on the argument that the market is overreacting to Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's an argument that can be reasonably made. The external environment was not kind to Caesars in the quarter. Visitation to Las Vegas is down amid macroeconomic uncertainty and fewer international arrivals. (As chief executive officer Tom Reeg has noted in recent quarters, the flow of guests from Canada in particular has dried up). Hold both in Las Vegas table games and in the Caesars Digital business was well below expectations: accounting for better-than-usual hold in Q3 2024, luck alone hit year-over-year EBITDA by $61 million, more than half the reported decline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet there were some bright spots. Regional revenue rose more than 6% year-over-year. That's both good news for the segment and adds some support to the idea that problems in Vegas are due to the market rather than execution. Caesars Digital profits look awful — EBITDA of $28 million against $52 million the year before — but normalized for hold and the year-prior sale of the World Series of Poker earnings actually rose modestly. Sports betting handle rose 6.4% year-over-year, after a first-half decline management attributed to lower marketing spend; hold there is not a Caesars-specific problem, as favorites <a href=\"https://www.covers.com/sport/football/nfl/league-trends/seasontodate\" rel=\"nofollow\">have notably outperformed</a> early in the National Football League season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And so it is fair to ask what, exactly, changes with the bull case coming out of the quarter. This is still a strong land-based business, albeit one facing short-term turbulence in Vegas. On the Q3 call, Reeg said of the digital business that \"all of our goals remain in front of us in terms of what we've laid out for digital and [we] fully<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834363-caesars-entertainment-inc-czr-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\"> expect that we'll get there</a>\". In August, I noted that at least on paper, an investor could argue that if those targets (including $500 million in annual Adjusted EBITDA) were hit, Caesars Digital would be <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4815059-caesars-entertainment-stock-getting-closer-to-a-buy\">worth about $10 billion</a>. Right now, Caesars' market cap sits at roughly $4 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even setting aside the potential for a spin and/or assuming Caesars disappoints, consolidated valuation looks at worst reasonable. 7x-plus is a discount to other brick-and-mortar players. Capital expenditures should come down in the next couple of years; Reeg has cited a $1 billion free cash flow target, but even assuming the company falls short the stock is still trading at maybe 5x-6x FCF. That's after the stock has been more than halved in twelve months to reach a five-year low, a decline that, from one perspective seems driven more by noise around tariffs, geopolitics, inflation, and even <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500235-draftkings-and-flutter-slide-after-kalshi-stuns-the-sports-betting-sector-with-huge-trading-volume\">prediction markets</a> than anything clearly, structurally, wrong with the underlying business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Indeed, Reeg himself made a version of this case on the Q3 call, focusing on results on the Vegas Strip in particular:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>[Q3] was undeniably soft versus last year, and we're glad to see it coming back in the fourth quarter. It doesn't take a lot to turn that back the other way. You're talking about 5 percentage points of occupancy got us to a 10% decline in adjusted EBITDA.</p> <p>You don't need much to swing back the other way to where you're right back to where you were before. So -- and one more point, we're talking about a quarter where we did about $400 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, so the summer in Vegas. That quarter typically pre-merger was $300 million to $320 million of EBITDA.</p> </blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Normalization Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, the bull case here is essentially that Caesars' stock is priced as if the underlying business is going to decline. But Q3 is worrisome precisely because it adds support to that prediction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reeg's quote above highlights one of the key risks around CZR at the moment (and indeed for a couple of years now): that the business recently has been overearning. It is easy for the CEO to say, \"well, we'll just get the five points back\". But Strip occupancy in Q3 was still 91.6%. For legacy Caesars (it was Eldorado Resorts, where Reeg was named CEO at the beginning of 2019, that acquired Caesars and took the target's name), Strip occupancy was <a href=\"https://investor.caesars.com/news-releases/news-release-details/caesars-entertainment-reports-financial-results-third-quarter-4#:~:text=Third%20Quarter%20Highlights&amp;text=Net%20loss%20attributable%20to%20Caesars,increased%205.8%25%20to%20%24635%20million%20.\" rel=\"nofollow\">95.6% in 2019</a> and 92.6% the year before.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In that context, it's not as if the external environment is horrible; in fact, the Q3 2025 print above 91% seems much closer to mid-cycle levels (at least based on 2010s performance) than does the 97% posted in the year-prior quarter. In other words, Q3 2025 looks much more like a mid-cycle print than one buffeted by external, temporary headwinds. That's particularly true because margins remain elevated, at 39.8% this quarter against mid-30s prints before the pandemic (and over 44% in Q3 2024).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The same worry holds in the regional business. Top-line performance was solid: as noted, revenue was up more than 6%, while table drop was +16% and slot handle +9%. But here, too, margins are a concern: margins dropped 150 basis points, and Adjusted EBITDA increased just 1.6%. That's with contributions from the new property in Virginia and a massive renovation and rebranding in New Orleans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Caesars also has ramped promotional spend, and while Reeg insisted the company wouldn't get into a \"promotional war\", here, too, there's a worry that margins and profits are likely to return toward pre-pandemic levels as acquisition spending normalizes. That trend would still imply significant compression from 2025 levels (though it's harder to parse exact margins, on a blended basis the merged companies seem to have been in the high 20s, 300-400 bps below the current print).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Terrible Quarter For Digital</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The margin compression is concerning but not terribly surprising. The results from digital, however, do look like a surprise — and hardly a pleasant one. Even accounting for hold, a ~2.5% increase in EBITDA in the quarter is nowhere near good enough. Reeg has been talking for a few quarters about the benefit from sponsorships that are rolling off; that was largely a 2026 boost but there should have been some boost in the quarter. Here, too, marketing spend is up, and yet at least in state-level figures there's no sign that Caesars has <a href=\"https://www.casinoreports.com/us-sports-betting-market-stats-database/\" rel=\"nofollow\">gained any share</a> in sports betting. iGaming handle did jump 24%, but even growth there decelerated from first-half levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the end of the day, $42 million in hold-normalized EBITDA simply isn't good enough, or close. Reeg is reiterating past targets — including a $500 million annual bogey for the business—but it's hard to see how Caesars gets there without significant state-level expansion of iGaming. Sports betting share is simply too low, and organic growth in iGaming no doubt will continue to slow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And the catch here is that Digital ostensibly should have a much higher valuation than the legacy brick-and-mortar business. So lower expectations have a material impact on overall valuation. That's doubly true given the still-running debate over whether online revenues 'cannibalize' legacy options, a debate that has received some extra juice amid the furor over prediction market growth. (For what it's worth, from here the argument that the likes of Kalshi will take material share seems overwrought for now, but it clearly has some purchase in the market at the moment).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Change At The Top?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market's reaction to the quarter simply doesn't seem like an overreaction. The blue-sky bull case for CZR was that the legacy business would stabilize at margins still above pre-pandemic levels, while the digital business grew into a multi-billion-dollar valuation. Both sides of that case took a hit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet there doesn't seem to be much urgency from Reeg and management, even with the stock at a five-year low. Instead, there is a lot of discussion about what is going on outside the business. Indeed, toward the beginning of Reeg's prepared remarks, the CEO noted that the quarter took a hit of \"a little over $10 million of one-time items that benefited us last year and didn't repeat\". That seems to add some context to the profit decline in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problem is that if you go back a year, Reeg opened his prepared remarks by noting that in Q3 2024 there were <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4730691-caesars-entertainment-inc-czr-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript\">$10 million</a> in one-time <em>expenses</em> that weren't added back to Adjusted EBITDA. This is becoming a constant pattern: earnings are going in the wrong direction, the stock has been halved in twelve months, and yet per Reeg, everything is fine. That in turn raises serious doubts about Reeg's insistence that digital targets are on track. So does the fact that three quarters ago, Reeg was musing about <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4761956-caesars-entertainment-inc-czr-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript\">reaching $1 billion</a> in free cash flow this year; the figure through three quarters is $350 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that Q3 suggests a business facing serious challenges both in brick-and-mortar and digital, confidence in management is paramount. And at this point, it's difficult to have that confidence. As I've written before, Reeg was instrumental in the hugely impressive roll-up that Eldorado executed over the last decade. But more recently, it's been a very different story: Caesars' stock is now down 48% since the beginning of 2019. (The S&amp;P 500, including dividends, has tripled).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As with Q3, there are explanations for that underperformance and reasons to believe that the trend will eventually turn. But that's been the case for some time now, and the trend hasn't turned. It does seem like big changes may well be needed — but it's hard to bet on those changes happening when Caesars' management continues to act as if nothing is really wrong.</p>",
