But for long-term investors considering new positions, the real question is<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> this: how many years of returns am I willing to give up for the promise of compounding beyond that point? And this isn’t theoretical. When a company trades at 293 times its forward earnings, you automatically accept that a portion of your future gains has already been pulled forward.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a logical sequence to my previous <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4813076-the-maximum-valuation-for-palantir\">thesis</a>, wherein I had systematically worked through Palantir's TAM to arrive at a maximum valuation of $213 by 2029. The stock is slowly creeping up to that price. And I checked the calendar. It is still 2025. I thought, okay, maybe the aggregate market is looking beyond the 2029 price and maybe the CAGR over a decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The results from my analysis show this is a bet that gets harder as the law of large numbers kicks in. It is hard to predict when, but Palantir remains a favorite candidate of mine for a painful repricing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Breaking down the P/E ratio</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One way to quantify this trade-off is to decompose the P/E ratio in its two distinct states: 1) the “low-growth”, terminal value state and 2) the hypergrowth state. The first part is easier, but we need to iterate the calculation to assume a reasonable discount rate. If you look at a no-growth multiple, it is essentially the inverse of the discount rate. For readers interested in deriving this, you take the discounted cash flow equation with earnings representing cash flows. You then take earnings to the left-hand side and apply g=0 which results in P/E = 1/r.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Price = Earnings x (1 + growth rate (g)) / (discount rate (r) – g).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, if your discount rate is 10%, the multiple is 10x (1/0.10). The 10x multiple is fair, maybe even generous if you look at companies with 0% growth, which often trade at a huge discount. Now I assume a 5% low-growth rate, and this is to account for the idea that lower growth in an AI company could look different. It may be slightly higher than GDP if you account for where the industry could be relative to other industries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">P/E (21) = 1.05 / (10% - 5%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now to calculate the high-growth side of the equation, we need to look at the company’s TTM multiple, as the earnings in the next 12 months are also a part of future growth. Palantir’s TTM multiple is 358 times earnings.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth factor and the number of years</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To translate valuation into time, I calculate what I’d call a growth factor to find how much earnings need to expand to squeeze into a low-growth multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth factor = Starting P/E (358x) / Terminal P/E (21x) = 17.05</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This just tells that Palantir’s earnings must grow by a factor of 17.05 times, or 1,605% from TTM levels, for the 358x multiple to become a 21x multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With growth rates, valuation is a game of being in the ballpark and is not about being precise. What we are looking for is the average CAGR, so the variability isn’t as big of a concern if the average is in the ballpark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The final step is to solve for the number of years (N) to achieve a growth factor of 17.05x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(1 + g<sub>high</sub>)<sup>N</sup> = 17.05</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can solve for N using a range of aggressive growth rates. The table below shows how many years of returns an investor would forgo based on different assumptions for the growth rate. If you want to assume a custom “g” different from the one I assumed, all you have to do is take the log on both sides. So, for a 200% growth, it would be log (17.05) / log (1+ 200%), or 2.5 years.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><strong>Assumed earnings growth</strong></td> <td><strong>Years to payback (N)</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>100.0%</td> <td>4.09</td> </tr> <tr> <td>90.0%</td> <td>4.42</td> </tr> <tr> <td>80.0%</td> <td>4.83</td> </tr> <tr> <td>70.0%</td> <td>5.34</td> </tr> <tr> <td>60.0%</td> <td>6.03</td> </tr> <tr> <td>50.0%</td> <td>6.99</td> </tr> <tr> <td>40.0%</td> <td>8.43</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I assume some of the bullish investors might say that the 100% or 4 years doesn’t sound that bad and the company could maintain a strong momentum beyond that period. The catch is, as the base gets larger each year, it gets harder to achieve the same rate of expansion in the next period. For instance, at a 100% CAGR, the company’s $772.6 million in net income would have to reach $12.3 billion in the next 4 years. This is nearly 3.5 times the TTM revenue and 16 times the TTM net income.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>But What If Palantir Is Truly Different?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bullish investors will correctly argue that this payback model is flawed if Palantir isn't a normal company. The bull case rests on three powerful ideas:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Transformative Tech:</strong> Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is a unique, \"operating system for the enterprise\" that no competitor can match.</li> <li> <strong>Sticky Moat:</strong> The platform creates incredibly high switching costs, locking in customers (both government and commercial) for decades.</li> <li> <strong>Margin Expansion:</strong> As the business scales, the software-based model will lead to massive operating leverage and margin expansion.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These points are not a secret; they are the reason the stock trades at 358x. The question is not if these bull cases are true, but what they are worth. My analysis, which results in a 4-8 year payback period, already assumes a phenomenal, best-in-class CAGR of 40% to 100% for many years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bull case doesn't just need to be right. It needs to be so right that it can deliver growth even beyond these extreme expectations, or it must justify a terminal multiple far higher than 21x. In my view, the \"law of large numbers\" outlined in the 100% CAGR scenario makes this a near-mathematical impossibility.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tying it back to Q3 Expectations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The consensus estimate for revenue is $1.09 billion, which is a sequential growth of 8.7% and a 50% expansion year-over-year. This is in-line with what management guided in Q2, which is why I think they will easily beat the consensus. Tech company guidance tends to be quite conservative, which is also known as “a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sandbag.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">sandbagged</a> number” they can easily beat. More importantly, the diluted EPS growth is expected to be around 78%, which fits in at around 5 years of waiting time for long-term investors looking to accumulate at current levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ll also be closely watching the stock compensation figures, as they are a significant drag on GAAP profitability and shareholder dilution. The market is willing to look past it because the topline growth is so explosive. But the total unrecognized expense is substantial and is <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001321655/e672795c-bf28-4956-9251-6da233852c18.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">close</a> to $1.3 billion as of 2Q 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1179\" data-height=\"423\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SBC (Stock option &amp; SARS)\" width=\"640\" height=\"230\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-1761792075870812_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">SBC (Stock option &amp; SARS) <span>(Palantir 2Q25 10-Q)</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1167\" data-height=\"349\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"RSU &amp; Total SBC\" width=\"640\" height=\"191\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/48014573-17617921542719047_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">RSU &amp; Total SBC <span>(Palantir 2Q25 10-Q)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond headline numbers, I think the market will be laser-focused on the quality of revenue. The real engine of growth is the US Commercial segment which is the primary vehicle for the AI platform, or AIP. Investors will be looking for this segment to post numbers that far exceed the blended 50% growth to prove that the AIP adoption thesis is on track. A leading indicator is the commercial customer count. A massive jump would indicate that the “AIP bootcamp” sales funnel is working and give a lot more credibility to the shorter payback period. However, the shorter payback period is still at least 4 years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the earnings, the stock won’t trade on Q3 results but on the Q4 and 2026 guidance. This is where the payback analysis comes full circle. For an investor believing in the shorter payback period, I think management must signal that the 50+% growth trajectory is the new baseline. If management hints at a range of 30% - 40% due to the higher base, I think the stock will experience an immediate and painful repricing. Just based on how difficult it gets to grow at higher bases, I am maintaining a Sell going into Q3 earnings.</p>",

This was a relatively good price for Amplify that was above what I had previously estimated<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> those assets would fetch. This should allow Amplify to pay off most of its $130 million credit facility debt.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amplify is still in the process of selling its Oklahoma assets. If it can get $110 million to $120 million for those assets, that would give it plenty of cash to help fund future Beta development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I've now increased <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4826075-amplify-energy-aiming-for-large-divestitures-to-eliminate-debt-and-focus-on-beta-development\">my upside valuation estimate</a> for Amplify to $8.75 per share (from $8.15 per share). This is based on long-term (after 2026) $70 WTI oil and assumes that Amplify can sell its Oklahoma assets for the above amount, as well as make further progress with cost reductions.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sale Of East Texas Assets</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amplify is selling its East Texas assets for combined consideration of $127.5 million. This includes $5.5 million in net proceeds for its remaining interest in some units with Haynesville rights <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001533924/dd93818d-a0a9-4b27-bc26-f7063287928a.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">and $122 million</a> (subject to customary post-closing adjustments) for its main East Texas assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These East Texas assets had approximately 6,400 BOEPD in Q2 2025 production, and is roughly 5% oil, 27% NGLs, and 68% natural gas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was a relatively strong price of 0.82x Proved PV-10 at $65 WTI oil and $4.00 NYMEX natural gas or 1.06x Proved PV-10 at $70 WTI oil and $3.50 NYMEX natural gas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My rough estimate is that those East Texas assets would have generated around $20 million to $25 million in 2026 EBITDA at current strip prices.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Oklahoma Assets</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amplify is still looking to sell its Oklahoma assets. Those assets produced approximately 4,400 BOEPD in Q2 2025, and the production is roughly 19% oil, 28% NGLs, and 53% natural gas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 2026 EBITDA from the Oklahoma assets would be fairly similar (around $25 million) to the East Texas assets at current strip prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Amplify can get $110 million to $120 million for the Oklahoma assets, that would be a solid amount. The Oklahoma assets have a higher PD PV-10 (at both $65 WTI oil and $4 NYMEX natural gas and $70 WTI oil and $3.50 NYMEX natural gas) than the divested East Texas assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am being more conservative with the multiple (to PD PV-10) for the Oklahoma assets since Amplify had identified somewhat more development potential for its East Texas assets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Effect On Debt</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amplify had $130 million in credit facility debt at the end of Q2 2025, so pro forma for the East Texas divestitures, Amplify will have minimal credit facility debt remaining. The interest rate on Amplify credit facility debt was around 8.4% at the end of 2025, so Amplify will save around $10 million per year in interest costs due to the East Texas sale proceeds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Selling the Oklahoma assets would give Amplify a nice amount of net cash to allow for future Beta development. Otherwise, without a sale of the Oklahoma assets, Amplify may need to take on a bit of credit facility debt again to fund that Beta development.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Upcoming Q3 2025 Earnings Call</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amplify is expected to report Q3 2025 results in a couple of days. Amplify's East Texas divestiture won't affect operational results for that quarter, and I'd assume that Amplify won't update its full year guidance until the deal closes. Since the deal is likely closing in late Q4 2025, there may be relatively minimal impact on 2025 guidance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key items I am looking for in Amplify's upcoming earnings report are its ability to deliver on its expected lease operating expense reductions and whether there is continued outperformance from its recent Beta wells.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am expecting Amplify to deliver around $20 million to $25 million in adjusted EBITDA in Q3 2025. This would be higher than the $19 million in adjusted EBITDA that it reported in Q2 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My expectations for a modest quarter-over-quarter increase in adjusted EBITDA are driven mainly by Amplify's cost reduction efforts at Bairoil. These savings are expected to more than offset the impact of Amplify's Eagle Ford divestiture (which was around 6% of Amplify's total production and 10% of its oil production) at the beginning of Q3 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amplify reported $38.6 million in lease operating expenses in Q2 2025 (which would have been close to $37 million excluding the Eagle Ford). It has provided guidance for $61 million (or $30 million to $31 million per quarter) in 2H 2025 lease operating expenses, with the reduction driven by Bairoil cost reduction efforts and fewer workovers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm currently expecting Amplify's Q3 2025's lease operating expenses to be a few million higher than its Q4 2025 lease operating expenses due to the Bairoil cost reduction projects being completed partway through Q3 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amplify's Beta development will be the main catalyst for the company after its Oklahoma assets are sold. So far, Amplify's recent Beta D-Sand wells are trending well above type curve, with an estimated combined (for three wells) PV-10 of $49.7 million at $65 WTI oil. I am interested in seeing how these recent wells have performed with another three months worth of data.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"931\" data-height=\"716\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Recent Beta Results\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"492\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/4579591-17619361545639687_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Recent Beta Results <span>(amplifyenergy.com (Q2 2025 Presentation))</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These three wells have performed close to 80% above expectations (based on projected PV-10 per well at $65 WTI oil).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Estimated Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I had previously estimated $210 million in net proceeds from the sale of Amplify's East Texas and Oklahoma assets. I am increasing that estimate to $235 million after it received a relatively strong price for its East Texas assets. This adds around $0.60 per share to Amplify's value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus the upside scenario for Amplify increases to around $8.75 per share (from $8.15 per share).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This upside scenario does have several assumptions, though. One assumption is that WTI oil prices will rebound to $70 by 2027. Amplify will be a 100% oil company after it sells its Oklahoma assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A second assumption is that further Beta development and Amplify's cost reduction efforts at Bairoil can reduce its lease operating expenses to around $33 per BOE. This was nearly $42 per BOE for Bairoil and Beta combined in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My final main assumption (for that upside scenario) is that Amplify's cash G&amp;A can go from around $26 million currently to $18 million per year after the East Texas and Oklahoma divestitures.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amplify is selling its East Texas assets for $127.5 million, which should pay off most of its credit facility debt ($130 million at the end of Q2 2025). Amplify is still attempting to sell its Oklahoma assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If it can get $110 million to $120 million for those assets, it would give Amplify a healthy amount of cash for future Beta development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the East Texas asset sale fetched more than I had estimated, I am increasing Amplify's upside value to $8.75 per share. This upside scenario involves $70 WTI oil by 2027 along with continued progress with cost reductions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It will be important for Amplify to continue reducing its operational costs as well as reduce G&amp;A costs, given that its size will be significantly smaller after the divestitures. As well, efficient Beta development (increasing production in the longer-term) will also be very important.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The upcoming Q3 2025 earnings call will give three more months of production data from Amplify's recent Beta wells as well as a partial idea of how much impact its Bairoil cost reduction projects have made on its lease operating expenses.</p>",

SBET shares have given back over 50% since that July 18th article.

One where rather than trading at several multiples over its ETH assets, shares of SBET are currently trading at a fairly large discount to the ETH that the company holds. As of intraday October 31st, SBET shares are trading at significant discount to mNAV. The company holds roughly 860k ETH which gives SharpLink an ETH net asset valuation of $3.6 billion. This is well ahead of the $2.9 billion market capitalization of the company's shares. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1270\" data-height=\"297\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SharpLink ETH Holdings &amp; NAV\" width=\"640\" height=\"150\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"150\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50832021-17619207851356633_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ETH Holdings &amp; NAV <span>(SharpLink)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At an average paid price of $3,609 per ETH, the company has about a $240 million unrealized ETH gain and has generated over 6.1k ETH in staking rewards. The key difference between Ethereum or even Solana (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SOL-USD\" title=\"Solana USD\">SOL-USD</a>) based DATs compared to the presumably more familiar Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD\" title=\"Bitcoin USD\">BTC-USD</a>) DATs is that ETH and SOL can be productive assets beyond transaction payment tokens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For instance, ETH can be staked natively on chain or through a staking service to generate passive yields and help boost security of the networks where they reside. This is a perfectly fine way to utilize PoS digital assets but it doesn't necessarily make a DAT a better investment than a simple <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835216-grayscale-vs-bitwise-which-solana-etf-is-better\">spot ETF that allows for staking</a>. The latter of which is theoretically much safer and eliminates operational or dilution risk. But because of things like re-staking and DeFi lending, there are more complex ways to generate greater returns than basic staking yields and SharpLink appears poised to do exactly that. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capital Allocation Strategy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4493383-sharplink-begins-utilizing-its-share-buyback-program\">early September</a>, SharpLink began buying back shares and cited undervaluation as the primary reason for doing so. At that time, the company had bought back 939k shares at a price just under $16 per. At an intraday price on October 31st under $14 as of writing, these purchases don't look that great in hindsight. Yet, the ability to buy back its own stock when shares are at depressed levels on an mNAV basis are what separate ETH DATs from BTC DATs. If/<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4827775-strategy-common-stock-dilution-continues\">when MSTR begins to trade under an mNAV of 1 again</a>, Strategy will have to either simply allow it, raise capital through debt or preferreds to buy back common, or sell Bitcoin to protect its equity valuation. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the ETH that SharpLink has purchased is generating yield with very little overhead, management arguably has far better optionality in defending its share price than most BTC-based DATs do. SharpLink can realistically put a floor on its mNAV should it choose to do so. Since the company has reiterated that it won't tap the ATM to buy more ETH when SBET trades at an mNAV discount, dilution concerns should be fairly mitigated at current levels. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More recently, SharpLink has expressed a willingness to go further out on the DeFi risk curve through <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509295-sharplink-to-deploy-200m-of-eth-on-consensys-linea\">ether.fi and EigenCloud</a>. Through either.fi, SharpLink is essentially staking ETH for the passive network yield while also taking a more liquid derivative token of that ETH that can be utilized for lending or re-staking. Doing so adds a small amount of additional risk to the ETH holdings but it does allow the company to generate a small premium on the yield that it would generate from simply staking the ETH passively and leaving it locked. Rather than 3%, SharpLink could be looking at closer to 5% in a conservative re-staking strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At $200 million deployed capital, this is not a large amount of SharpLink's ETH hoard as it's actually less than the company's unrealized gain from its ETH position. But it does allow management to show a competency in DeFi prowess and prove out the concept for shareholders before engaging with these types of networks to a larger degree.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Closing Takeaways</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I actually kind of like SBET at this price. Even though I think Ethereum is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833377-growth-and-a-catalyst-make-binance-coin-more-interesting\">arguably overpriced at 1,100x fees</a>, the degree to which SharpLink can monetize that ETH beyond basic staking strategies is interesting. To be sure, more complex yield strategies introduce an additional element of risk to the company's operations. But I think those risks are necessary to make the company something worth investing in. Truthfully, it may no longer be fair of me to refer to SharpLink simply as an \"Ethereum Wrapper.\" The fact of the matter is the company is starting to put its assets to work in a way that should benefit shareholder returns even in the event Ethereum somehow trades sideways for a considerable amount of time. I don't think sideways action is the most likely scenario for a variety of reasons.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But if we're speculating on the prospects of new financial rails gaining wider adoption in global settlement, I believe Ethereum is a good network to wager on. And the companies that already hold substantial ETH and put that ETH to work could find themselves well positioned for the future. That we can now buy productive ETH at a discount to liquidation value is compelling. I'm upgrading SBET from 'sell' straight to 'buy.'</p>",

I plan to use this overview as a launching pad to determine what's going on behind COWZ's strategy that has attracted over $18B in assets, and provide you with my opinion about whether COWZ is a \"buy\" in today's market. I hope you enjoy the read, and as always, I look forward to answering any questions you might have in the comments section afterward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">COWZ: Overview and Peer Group Comparison</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to <a href=\"https://www.paceretfs.com/products/cowz/\" rel=\"noopener\">Pacer</a>, COWZ's selection process starts with the Russell 1000 and narrows it down to 400 based on free float market cap. The Index then filters out companies operating in the Financials industry, and the top 100 securities with the highest free cash flow yield form the Index, as summarized below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618250022113717.png?io=w640\" alt=\"COWZ Security Selection Process\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"637\" height=\"468\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618250022113717.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618250022113717.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618250022113717.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618250022113717.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618250022113717.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618250022113717.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618250022113717.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618250022113717.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Pacer ETFs</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pacer defines free cash flow yield as free cash flow (operating cash flow less capex) divided by enterprise value (market cap less cash plus debt), and you can see how this single statistic promotes high-quality companies trading at a discount. Interestingly, the Index weights by free cash flow (not free cash flow yield), capped at 2% at each quarterly reconstitution, which further supports quality, and the metrics you see above are precisely what COWZ consistently achieve - the Index's free cash flow percentage is more than twice that of the Russell 1000 Index (6.03% vs. 2.43%), and its 16.55x trailing P/E represents a 39% discount over its benchmark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An additional feature worth noting is COWZ's 0.49% expense ratio, which reduces fund distributions and has led to a meager 1.63% trailing dividend yield as of October 30, 2025. COWZ's median bid/ask spread is nearly 0.00%, implying excellent liquidity, although that's common to most ETFs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>COWZ's $18B in assets under management makes it Pacer's most successful cash-flow-based offering, and as noted in my thesis, many copycats have emerged, </span><span>though</span><span> many have minimal assets and are </span><span>possible</span><span> going concerns.</span><span> However, the one that gets the most attention is the VictoryShares Free Cash Flow ETF (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VFLO\" title=\"Victoryshares Free Cash Flow ETF\">VFLO</a><span>), which incorporates forward-looking estimates into its selection process. I'll also look at the Pacer US Cash Cows Growth ETF (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BUL\" title=\"Pacer US Cash Cows Growth ETF\">BUL</a><span>), the Amplify Cash Flow Dividend Leaders ETF (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COWS\" title=\"Amplify Cash Flow Dividend Leaders ETF\">COWS</a><span>), and the Global X U.S. Cash Flow Kings 100 ETF (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FLOW\" title=\"Global X U.S. Cash Flow Kings 100 ETF\">FLOW</a><span>). </span><span>These ETFs aren't huge, but despite </span><span>the</span><span> increased competition, few funds target the same larg</span><span>e/m</span><span>id-cap size segment and trade at reasonably low </span><span>P/E's</span><span>.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">COWZ Composition</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sector Allocations and Top Ten Holdings</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The following table highlights the sector allocation differences between COWZ, VFLO, BUL, COWS, and FLOW. Notice how COWZ has no exposure to Financials and Real Estate under the GICS classification system, but otherwise, it's pretty well diversified at the sector level. Based on its 6.70/10 sector diversification score, it's about as well-diversified as COWS and FLOW and substantially better than VFLO and BUL, which have heavy allocations to Technology and Industrials, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618591489126637_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"687\" data-height=\"284\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618591489126637_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"COWZ Sector Allocations vs. VFLO, BUL, COWS, FLOW - By The Sunday Investor (Geoffrey Learmonth, ETF Analyst)\" width=\"640\" height=\"265\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618591489126637_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618591489126637_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618591489126637_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618591489126637_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618591489126637_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618591489126637_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618591489126637_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618591489126637_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">COWZ's top ten holdings are next, which total 22.68% of the portfolio.

However, it's hard to do so when you're sacrificing on virtually every other factor except quality, and I think that's where VFLO has possibly built a better mousetrap. In addition to superior one-year returns, even BUL, COWS, and FLOW have outperformed COWZ since COWS launched on September 13, 2023, the earliest common date for all tickers, as shown below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618648726295457_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"786\" data-height=\"241\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618648726295457_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"COWZ vs. VFLO vs. BUL vs. COWS vs. FLOW Growth With Dividends\" width=\"640\" height=\"196\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618648726295457_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618648726295457_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618648726295457_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618648726295457_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618648726295457_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618648726295457_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618648726295457_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618648726295457_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">COWZ Fundamentals: Top 25 Holdings</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next table highlights selected fundamental metrics for COWZ's top 25 holdings as of October 29, 2025. Not much has changed in the week since, but in COWZ's defense, I think it has the edge over its competitors on quality. Its free cash flow margins are excellent at 16.82%, and its 20.15% weighted average EBIT margins demonstrate terrific operational efficiency. Have a quick scan of the additional summary metrics at the bottom, and I'll offer some takeaways afterward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618675141964934_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"689\" data-height=\"519\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618675141964934_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"COWZ Fundamental Analysis vs. VFLO, BUL, COWS, FLOW - By The Sunday Investor (Geoffrey Learmonth), ETF Analyst at etf-rankings.com\" width=\"640\" height=\"482\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618675141964934_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618675141964934_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618675141964934_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618675141964934_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618675141964934_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618675141964934_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618675141964934_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51194860-17618675141964934_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">COWZ: Not The Best GARP Play</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">COWZ isn't a growth play, but it's still unfortunate that it has 1-2% lower historical and estimated earnings growth rates than VFLO and trades at a more expensive valuation based on forward earnings (14.51x vs. 13.29x). COWZ's growth rates are better than COWS and FLOW, but those two feature heavily discounted valuations, so the intent is clear. You might consider those ETFs for the value sleeve of your portfolio, but COWZ just doesn't stand out as either the best growth or value play.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can derive an implied PEG ratio for each ETF by dividing its estimated earnings growth rate into its forward P/E ratio, with lower values indicating more growth-at-a-reasonable-price. On this ratio, COWZ ranks #4/5, and it's actually BUL that stands out, as follows:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>COWZ: 14.51x / 7.74% = 1.87x</li> <li>VFLO: 13.29x / 9.48% = 1.40x</li> <li>BUL: 17.45x / 14.43% = 1.21x</li> <li>COWS: 11.26x / 6.77% = 1.66x</li> <li>FLOW: 11.20x / 2.68% = 4.19x</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I had never considered BUL an alternative to COWZ, but its 17.45x forward P/E is nothing to scoff at, especially when accompanied by an earnings growth rate nearly double that of COWZ. BUL still selects stocks based on free cash flow yield, but it screens the S&amp;P 900 Pure Growth Index and weights its 50 stocks by market cap instead of free cash flow. In my view, there's a good chance its better balance between value and growth will lead to more consistent and higher long-term returns.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">COWZ: Quality Is Excellent, Debt/FCF High But Explicable</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I mentioned, COWZ's quality, as measured by free cash flow and EBIT margins, is excellent, but it also has above-average return on assets, equity, and total capital, as summarized below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51194860-17619076234415846_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"688\" data-height=\"207\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51194860-17619076234415846_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"COWZ vs. VFLO vs. BUL vs. COWS vs. FLOW Quality Comparison - Best High Quality ETFs (etf-rankings.com, The Sunday Investor - Geoffrey Learmonth, ETF Analyst)\" width=\"640\" height=\"193\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51194860-17619076234415846_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51194860-17619076234415846_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51194860-17619076234415846_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51194860-17619076234415846_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51194860-17619076234415846_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51194860-17619076234415846_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51194860-17619076234415846_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/51194860-17619076234415846_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One potential concern for COWZ is a relatively high 6.60x debt-to-free cash flow ratio. However, compared to VFLO, COWZ has more allocated to sectors where more debt is normal (e.g., Consumer Staples, +9.5%) and less to sectors where free cash flow is often better (e.g., Technology, -10.1%). Therefore, this higher ratio is composition-related, and that's when relying on Seeking Alpha Factor Grades, which are sector-adjusted, can help. The table reveals that on a weighted average basis, COWZ's holdings score 9.45/10 on profitability, so I have little doubt COWZ is a high-quality ETF.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Recommendation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">COWZ has struggled recently and has lagged behind most ETFs with a cash flow focus, and one explanation is that it does not offer a compelling growth and value combination compared to its peers. By incorporating forward-looking estimates into its strategy, VFLO seems to have built a better mousetrap, but if you prefer to stick with Pacer Cash Cows ETFs, BUL features great margins, 14% estimated earnings per share growth, and a 17.45x forward P/E, which represents a 28% compared to Russell 1000 Index ETFs like <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWB\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 ETF\">IWB</a>.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, a balanced factor mix leads to better and more consistent long-term returns, but unfortunately, I don't have much confidence that COWZ can deliver that each quarter, so I recommend investors look elsewhere.

To be clear, even though investors' reaction to tech juggernauts' earnings has been mixed for now, it is still complicated to construct a thesis for the immediate shift in the market's narrative, as the case for the interest rates going down is in place, and the AI narrative remains supportive of elevated valuations (even though they are looking increasingly worrisome to me, but as a value investor, I do have a certain bias).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this regard, I see no justification for switching from the growth &amp; quality factor combination (or just pure growth, for investors with higher tolerance to risk) to value &amp; quality.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, while AVLV does deserve investor attention, chiefly because of the high quality of its portfolio (I will be giving a lot of details on that below in the note), I see no potential in it to outperform the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVV\" title=\"iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF\">IVV</a>) in the short to medium term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Basics of The Avantis US Large Cap Value ETF</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Inception: September 21, 2021</li> <li>AUM: $8.397 billion, as of October 30</li> <li>Investment Advisor: American Century Investment Management, Inc.</li> <li>Expense Ratio: 0.15%</li> <li>3-Year Annualized Total Return (October 2022–September 2025): 19.7% vs. 16.71% of the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWD\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF\">IWD</a>) and 24.9% of IVV</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV Strategy: Active, Quality-, Value-Centered</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we know from the Avantis <a href=\"https://www.avantisinvestors.com/avantis-investments/avantis-us-large-cap-value-etf/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>, AVLV \"seeks long-term capital appreciation,\" is managed actively, and is benchmarked against the Russell 1000 Value Index. The latter fact is the reason why I will be comparing AVLV's factor mix to that of IWD (a mild spoiler as usual: AVLV is considerably stronger in nearly all aspects).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What companies does AVLV favor? As explained in the summary prospectus:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The fund seeks to achieve higher expected returns by selecting securities of companies with higher profitability and value characteristics, as well as smaller market capitalizations relative to others within the fund's large cap investment universe.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are two key metrics (but there are others) that are considered when deciding whether a company is cheap enough and has appealing profitability:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The portfolio managers define “value characteristics” mainly as adjusted book/price ratio (though other price to fundamental ratios may be considered). The portfolio managers define “profitability” mainly as adjusted cash from operations to book value ratio (though other ratios may be considered).</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the stock selection process, other parameters are taken into account as well, including free float, liquidity, past performance, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Does AVLV's turnover match its active approach? I would say that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVLV/risk\">at 5%</a>, it clearly does not, indicating that the portfolio sees nearly no changes, at least during \"the most recent fiscal year\" as of the most recent summary prospectus (as of January 1, 2025).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just for context, IWD's turnover is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWD/risk\">3x higher</a> at 15%, and this is the fund tracking an index, not actively managed.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since its inception in September 2021, AVLV has delivered quite a robust performance, as it has beaten IWD and the Invesco S&amp;P 500® Pure Value ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RPV\" title=\"Invesco S&amp;P 500® Pure Value ETF\">RPV</a>), which I believe was secured by the quality ingredient of its strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_28be882b551aeea1c1c7a5605912ef9e.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_28be882b551aeea1c1c7a5605912ef9e.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_28be882b551aeea1c1c7a5605912ef9e.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_28be882b551aeea1c1c7a5605912ef9e.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_28be882b551aeea1c1c7a5605912ef9e.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_28be882b551aeea1c1c7a5605912ef9e.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_28be882b551aeea1c1c7a5605912ef9e.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_28be882b551aeea1c1c7a5605912ef9e.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_28be882b551aeea1c1c7a5605912ef9e.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

Its capital efficiency indicators (for instance, Return on Assets) are meaningfully stronger than IWD's as well.</li> <li>Surprisingly, it even has advantages on the growth front, including a 16.32% WA forward EPS growth rate.</li> <li>Its allocations to stocks exhibiting strong momentum characteristics (a B- Quant Momentum grade or higher) and sporting an appealing EPS Revisions grade are both higher than those of IWD.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To conclude, AVLV offers a potent active value &amp; quality strategy, robust enough to beat a few actively and passively managed peers like JAVA and RPV. Regarding factors, it is stronger than IWD in every single aspect I assessed above (some investors might dislike it for higher weighted average beta coefficients though). However, it does have a few disadvantages, chief among them being its inability to beat IVV and CGDV, as well as a quite uncomfortable downside capture ratio. So I believe a Hold rating is the one I should maintain today.</p>",

in your reading, you may recall that I mentioned a potential shift in the status quo for crude, with the latest news from OPEC+ being what I was referring to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a meeting due this coming Sunday, the group leans towards a modest increase in output throughout December of 137,000 barrels, meeting the same target as September and October.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, an increase in supply with demand unchanged is inherently oil price negative, but considering OPEC has opted for a modest increase in production three months consecutively, markets are beginning to read between the lines:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>OPEC+ is becoming increasingly comfortable with the global oil supply</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If nothing else, this begins to limit the downside potential of crude, with current supply levels unlikely to be hiked significantly going

This reading came in above the projected 42.3. Despite the improvement, the index still came in below 50, which marks the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> 23rd consecutive month of contraction for regional business activity.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Background on Chicago PMI</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Chicago PMI assesses the business conditions and the economic health of the manufacturing sector in the Chicago region. A value above 50.0 indicates expanding manufacturing activity, while a value below 50.0 indicates contracting manufacturing activity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at its historical performance, the current level of 43.8 is lower than where the index stood at the start of 6 of the 7 recessions since its inception. This suggests that such weak readings have often preceded broader economic downturns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"3131\" data-height=\"2275\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chicago PMI\" width=\"1280\" height=\"930\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>A Closer Look Since 2000</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Examining data since 2000, the index has undergone fluctuations, often aligning with broader economic cycles.

But based on historical metrics, it suggests that a correction is coming - even if we don't know the exact timing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This potential for a correction has me essentially \"not investing\" at this time, except where I can see very clear upsides based on low valuations, in safe companies that will withstand \"any\" downturn, and where I have a long-term conviction. Such companies obviously come in many different shapes. Some are REITs, some are companies such as utilities, and some might be pharma companies. In this article, a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790770-veolia-your-2025-pick-for-waste-water-recycling\">follow-up to this particular piece</a> from about six months back, I am going to update my thesis on <span class=\"cf0\">Veolia </span><span class=\"cf0\">Environnement</span><span class=\"cf0\"> SA</span> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VEOEY\" title=\"Veolia Environnement SA\">OTCPK:VEOEY</a>, Euronext Paris: VIE). Veolia is what I would consider an \"environment\" company. That doesn't mean renewables, but instead things like recycling, wastewater, water, and the like. If you follow my work, you know that I love these sorts of companies for the combination of regulatory safety, growth potential, and the fundamental characteristics they offer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this article, I will update my thesis on the company, which, I believe, is far more attractive than last time I covered it, using the Q2 '25/Half-year results, and a forecast for Q3 '25, which are set to be released in less than 4 weeks (currently <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VEOEY/earnings\">estimated</a> for November 6th).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's see what we have here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Veolia: Upside Is Here, Fundamentals Are Solid, Growth Is likely - I See Few Downsides</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Veolia is one of those companies where I honestly see very few long-term, short-term, or medium-term downsides.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why is that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A combination of factors. Let's go through them, with examples for each.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First off, fundamentals. The company is simply very appealing. BBB credit means the company is IG-rated, and despite this, it has a close to 5% yield, which, for a French multi-utility with these sorts of basics, is very solid. The company has been able to grow EPS in double digits since COVID-19, and current forecasts consider it likely for this growth to continue. While at times volatile, as history suggests, the past few years have seen the company really consolidate around its core strengths, providing potential growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This potential growth and potential can be seen in things <a href=\"https://www.veolia.com/en/our-media/newsroom/press-releases/veolia-and-suez-announce-they-have-reached-agreement-allowing#:~:text=the%20implementation%20of%20Veolia's%20plan,identified%20by%20Veolia%20will%20remain.\" rel=\"nofollow\">like the Suez M&amp;A</a>, expected by me and other analysts to be very value-accretive to the companies in the near term. This is despite the price paid, which, according to some, was too high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm also not the only one to consider 2025-2027E results to be very conservative - this is one of those companies where I expect significantly better results than even the market does.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even if the company's target markets were to slow down, the company has ample room for operational efficiencies, as evidenced by both the financial and management. But perhaps most importantly, Veolia has removed much of its cyclical exposure over the past two decades - another advantage. Furthermore, due to the relatively high inflation rate we've been having, cost savings rates have been seeing a higher retention rate - and the economic slowdown in Europe is turning around a bit, resulting in some upside for the company here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1375\" data-height=\"711\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Veolia Investor Presentation 1H25 IR\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Veolia Investor Presentation 1H25 IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2Q25/1H25 results were solid and do not, to my mind, reflect the current valuation of the company.

Three of the basic building blocks of our modern society. If they also had electricity generation to any significant degree and managed to make it work within the business model, it would be almost ridiculously solid. But the company, instead, is focusing on \"boosters,\" which are specialized forms of its current operations, like Bioenergy, Hazardous waste, and Water tech. Veolia is one of the most significant players in hazardous waste in certain geographies, and the company's significant push into the Middle East is one of the core reasons I remain so positive about the company here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1393\" data-height=\"725\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Veolia Investor Presentation 1H25 IR\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"333\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Veolia Investor Presentation 1H25 IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's synergy improvements over time have delivered over €150M worth of gains, with €482M post-Suez synergy gains, which is entirely in line with the year-end 2025E target of €530M.

Well, aside from political risks in France, where much of the legacy operations are located, there is very little operational risk at the very least. And the more the company actually moves outside of its legacy geography and becomes international, the more resilient it's likely to be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Veolia has not been assigned a premium by the market since late 2021. Since then, and the crash back in mid-2021/2022, it's been discounted at various rates. Today it trades below 13.2x, which, given what the company does, is fairly interesting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am much more positive about the company than I was even just a year ago. I consider it to have a moat, which it did not have in 2023-2024 (stabilization of municipal legacy water operations, following the fallout of municipal water cancellations and annulments in -15). The renewal rates for Veolia's contracts in France are also above 90%, highlighting just how entrenched this company is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that any valuation that puts this company below 13-14x P/E severely underestimates this company's potential - and that's with no growth, as opposed to the growth that's being forecasted here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For Q3 '25, I expect the company to continue alongside the performance to deliver an EPS growth of about 5% this year, with a growing EPS growth into 2026 and 2027E. I expect an EPS moving from €2.13/share this year to well over €2.6/share in 2 years. Even on the basis of just a conservative valuation, this would imply a significant upside here. The reason the company is likely to outperform in both Q3 '25 and 2025 is continued cost synergies, savings, and new contracts. I believe a combination of new business coupled with significant growth in key segments, like Hazardous waste, will deliver the 6-8% growth in earnings in 2026 and 2027, alongside better savings.

As I said in previous articles, my estimate for the fair value of Veolia is above 18-19x P/E, which implies a fair value level of €50/share. And even that is not very exuberant - because the company's 20-year average suggests a P/E of over 22x, implying a fair value of over €65/share. I'm not going that high - I'm \"happy\" at 18-19x. My €50/share fair value suggests that you can buy this company in 2027 below €42/share, and this year at about €37/share or below. That was part of the rationale for my €36.5 PT, which I at this time also retain from my previous article.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over time, I fully expect my investment here to generate well over a 70-80% RoR, even though this will likely take time. I expect the company's CapEx to \"peak out\" at about €3.8B per year until 2029 or so, and this excludes the buyout of minorities in one of the company's operations back in June of this year, in line with guidance. Taking this into consideration also doesn't change my thesis in a significant way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The only reason that's holding me back from going even higher with my expectations here is the fact that the company's regulated municipal operations, as the name suggests, regulators will prevent Veolia from earning returns in excess of expectations. Much of the company's earnings still come from regulated businesses. This is not a bad thing. But in my view, it puts a cap on what's possible for Veolia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I view Veolia as a \"BUY\" with a €36.5/share PT here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alternatives I would consider in the same sector would be only one - American Water Works (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AWK\" title=\"American Water Works Company, Inc.\">AWK</a>) (and that one isn't even that close in operations to this one, beyond water). However, AWK is tricky here because at a conservative valuation, the company doesn't offer my hurdle in the same way that Veolia does.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For that reason, I consider Veolia to be the \"choice cut\" in this sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks are as follows.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks &amp; Considerations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks to the company are primarily related to French municipal trends and regulations. The events in -09 highlight the political risks in France, when annulment of contracts until 2015 in the water space was announced - and it's not impossible that such an event may happen again (though given current trends, I do consider it on the unlikely side).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aside from this, it's all about the impact of savings, how much savings and efficiency can bring to the table, next to the company's other improvements. There's an open question here, but I would point to what the company has been able to do previously.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aside from that, I do not see any noteworthy risks to the company, and therefore consider the company a Buy with the following thesis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Veolia is a great business in several great fields, and this upside has materialized since the full results for 2025 H1. They have some excellent moats, a solid history, and good future prospects. The Suez M&amp;A only strengthened the company's next few years, and whatever downsides exist and uncertainties are there, I believe they're outweighed by the upside potential in this stock, further enhanced by more savings and efficiencies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are downsides and risks, but these, at this valuation of below 14x, are relatively small. A company such as this, with these sorts of operations, at this sort of price, is precisely the sort of investment you may want to make - at least it's the sort of investment that I, personally, want to go \"deeper\" in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This upside can even go up to 15-35% if we allow for a premium valuation or even higher, historically accurate EPS growth (which I am open to), valuing the company at 18-19x P/E. My official PT is €36.5/share for October/November 2025, and I'm at a Buy at this time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (<em>italicized</em>).</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em>This company is overall qualitative.</em></li> <li><em>This company is fundamentally safe/conservative &amp; well-run.</em></li> <li><em>This company pays a well-covered dividend.</em></li> <li>This company is currently cheap.</li> <li><em>This company has a realistic upside based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion.</em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company fulfills 3 out of 3 quality indicators, and 1 out of 2 valuation indicators. That means 4/5 \"stars\" here, which is enough for an attractive thesis for the company. Based on this, and a valuation target of €36.5/share where I see a risk/reward-adjusted upside that's attractive enough for me. I give the company a Buy rating as of October/November 2025.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a></span>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4809136-i-bought-amazon-as-im-ultra-bullish-on-its-margin-heavy-era-underway\">analysis</a>, the stock has gained 16% in price, a price return that has been particularly bolstered by strong <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511707-amazon-gaap-eps-of-1_95-beats-by-0_39-revenue-of-180_2b-beats-by-2_44b\">Q3 earnings</a>. In my prior analysis I analyzed<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the company's margin optimization, including operational efficiencies and Q2 earnings. My analysis was focused more on macro financials and sentiment considerations amid broad-based operational analysis. In this assessment, I'm delving into the company's autonomous strategy, a topic widely circulating in the press right now.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Preface: Q3</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before we begin on exploring the macro autonomy case for Amazon, the company just posted Q3 earnings, so I'll get you up to speed on that quickly here. If you're not interested in short-term earnings, feel free to skip to the next section below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/AMZN-Q3-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">In Q3</a>, net sales were up by +13% year-over-year, and service revenue significantly outpaced product revenue in growth (+16% versus +9.6%), with services offering a structurally more profitable mix. While the company's operating income was flat year-over-year, two charges hit which were non-recurring ($2.5B related to an FTC legal settlement, and ~$1.8B of severance). Without those charges, operating margin would have been ~12% versus ~11% a year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/AMZN-Q3-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">AI/data-center build-out</a> is still consuming cash at a remarkable rate. As of Q3, Amazon's TTM operating cash flow was $130.7B (up 16% year-over-year), but free cash flow fell to $14.8B because TTM purchases of PP&amp;E were $115.9B.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The headline <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/AMZN-Q3-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q4 guide</a> was for net sales of between +10% and +13% year-over-year, with modestly higher margins into peak season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, it was a strong quarter, marked by real structural investment trends that are outweighed by profitability-focused growth and long-term moat effects being established. All of this is well understood by the market, which is why shares rallied 14% post-release.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon Is Structurally Aligned With America's Growth Imperative</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We've already established in my last analysis that Amazon's next alpha phase is operating-leverage led. Any fears about Amazon's automation horizon appear misguided to me, given that there is no logical reality whereby the U.S. does not compete for macroeconomic leadership through bolstered capital market growth. This can only be achieved through the reduction in federal debt-to-GDP by boosting GDP growth. Though it may be decades before work becomes \"optional,\" the workforce will likely trend away from human labor toward oversight of autonomous systems in the next 10 years (this is common sense, if you see the current trends in AI adoption, growth, and automated workflows already permeating).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That means that at first, Amazon's workforce will probably slow in growth, but eventually, yes, I see no reason why the workforce will not be \"cut.\" This might see pushback from regulatory agencies, but those agencies would illogically be working against the macroeconomic health of free world nations by stunting GDP growth by reducing the capital efficiencies of low-cost-to-serve autonomous behemoths, like Amazon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, autonomy reduces hires per unit of volume, which reduces exposure to wage inflation and peak-season hiring spikes. Amazon's filings actually still show increasing <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000086/amzn-20250630.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">logistics costs</a>, but they are being partially offset by <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000004/amzn-20241231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">network efficiencies</a>, so labor minutes per unit are falling without excessive job cuts. This reflects a staggered approach to efficiency optimization as AI capabilities ramp up and before any speculative government-backed UBI supports demand even amid lower employment rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even in the short term, the notion of UBI may not be as critical as we assume if pricing reduces and demand increases as forms of \"optional\" labor dominate the macro free market; i.e., the notion of \"socialism amid autonomy\" could be defunct. Right now, as automation makes the same-/<a href=\"https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2024-amazon-sustainability-report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">next-day network</a> more efficient and reduces the cost to serve <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-2023-letter-to-shareholders\" rel=\"noopener\">per unit</a>, small but persistent price cuts will transfer to the shopper (including time). That smooths volatility in discretionary spending and raises baseline demand, particularly in repeatable, low-ASP categories where shipping fees previously made financial returns look weak.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margins Rise As Prices Fall And Shares Keep Compounding</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We're really looking at two effects here on the company's financial positioning; the first is expanded gross margin, and the second is reduced prices for consumers. The second-order effect should be gradually increasing demand, allowing for the company to be considered a \"growth stock\" for decades to come if executed properly. This is rare—usually companies at maturity, like Amazon, transform into stalwarts and focus on operational efficiencies moderately to maintain average capital appreciation amid a saturated market. Amazon is in a unique position where it can incrementally improve margins and slash product and shipping prices to create an EPS-revenue growth flywheel; it looks like this:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Gross margin expansion raises EPS <strong>–&gt;</strong> lower prices and delivery friction lift revenue volume <strong>–&gt;</strong> volume growth compounds operating leverage <strong>–&gt;</strong> EPS growth over revenue growth while revenue growth stays resilient <strong>–&gt;</strong> reinvestment sustains the flywheel for decades. </em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is the primary reason why investing in Amazon right now is wise. You're investing in a growth flywheel that is optimized for durability amid the disruption from autonomous technology. Sentiment for the stock is elevated, but deservedly so. The monthly-intervals price chart shows the stock heavily above the 50-month MA, but this is typical for Amazon across the past 15 years. You get what you pay for, and Amazon, by all means of fundamental assessment, offers a fair valuation with resilient market-leading growth strengthened by a resilient moat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1633\" data-height=\"1316\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMZN One-Month-Intervals Price Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"516\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AMZN One-Month-Intervals Price Chart <span>(Author's Chart)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's forward PEG non-GAAP ratio is only about 10% higher than the sector, which reflects a moderate premium but indicates that the market is probably correctly bullish on the fact that consensus growth estimates are a little too low.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1206\" data-height=\"425\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon Consensus EPS Revisions\" width=\"640\" height=\"226\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Amazon Consensus EPS Revisions <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I consider it important at this juncture to consider an allocation in Amazon based on future growth optionality that is implicit in the current macro trends. That is, as automated machinery and intelligent software scale, Amazon is a key beneficiary across both its physical and digital infrastructure stack. This vertically integrated model bolsters the likelihood that Amazon will outperform the analyst consensus. However, we also should recognize that Amazon has never significantly outperformed the consensus price targets in the past five years, meaning that achieving a 20%+ stock price CAGR over the long term is less likely than if Amazon stock was undervalued by Wall Street (it's not).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1300\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMZN Price Targets Historical\" width=\"640\" height=\"222\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Labor Optics, Deflation, And Macro Elasticity</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, even slower hiring per unit of volume can be portrayed politically as job destruction; the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/amazon-takes-challenge-nlrbs-structure-us-appeals-court-2024-09-27/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NLRB</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/amazon-sues-wash-labor-agency-over-warehouse-safety-fines-2022-10-04/\" rel=\"noopener\">state labor boards</a> have already scrutinized Amazon's warehouse practices, and a rapid pivot to robotics could reignite union and legislative pressure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking further out, Amazon can't indefinitely offset macro softness through price cuts without eroding unit economics, so if discretionary income compresses in phases, Amazon's earnings power could also face volatility. This is why I believe management will be much more focused on macroeconomic analysis in the decade ahead to time price decreases (and increases) amid changing socioeconomics due to smaller big enterprise workforces softening demand in cycles unless prices correspondingly collapse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My above thesis also assumes rising affordability and optional labor sustain demand, but if political systems fail to backfill displaced income or if consumer psychology shifts toward savings, volume expansion could undershoot expectations. Also, in the bear case, systematic price deflation from automation could suppress nominal revenue growth even as EPS rises—to put it another way, staging or tempering the fundamental implications of autonomy may equate to a beast too difficult to tame.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Buy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm bullish on Amazon, but I think expectations need to be tempered. This is not a 3x the market stock; it's 2x the market at a push, and more like 50% greater returns than the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>) in the base case. That's still a decent return, but it isn't the 30–50% annual return one would seek if scrutinizing the market for the highest growth compounders.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, Amazon has a place in portfolios as ballast, aka defensive growth, which sounds contradictory given management's aggressive autonomy stance. However, the company is simply too saturated in its market for technological mechanics to make this an elite pick in terms of absolute returns. Amazon stock is elite in resiliency, and was once elite for its stock price returns, but now, the company has morphed into a mechanism for growth-portfolio security.</p>",
