Margin improvements were primarily driven by Seagate’s focus on its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4823388-seagate-growth-runway-extends-with-large-data-center-investments\">build-to-order strategy</a>, which locks in production for known customer sales. Rather than forecasting demand and risking overcapacity that may end up as an inventory impairment, Seagate switched over to this model in 2023 to develop a more disciplined approach to engaging with the end market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As part of its strategy, Seagate incrementally increases the selling process of its hard disk drives (HDDs) with new orders, which is what led to the significant margin improvement in Q1 ’26. In addition to these improvements, the build-to-order model provides Seagate visibility into future quarters; management indicated in Q1 ’26 that demand conditions are favorable through calendar year 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth in Q1 ’26 was largely driven by the cloud services providers (CSPs), enterprise, and VIA customers, leading to a 33.63% increase in Data Center market sales. Seagate shipped 182 exabytes in Q1’26, a 32% increase when compared to the previous year’s quarter. Seagate is making good progress with its HAMR-based Mozaic platform, having qualified 5 global CSPs on the new Mozaic 3+ terabyte per disk products that can scale upwards of 36TB per drive. Seagate is in the process of qualifying 3 additional CSPs that should be concluded in calendar year 1h26. In addition to this, Seagate is qualifying CSPs for its Mozaic 4+ terabyte per disk platform, which is expected to ramp production in 1h26.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the biggest growth drivers for Seagate in terms of storage demand will likely be AI inferencing, specifically for video content generation. Accordingly, a 1-minute AI video requires 20,000x more storage capacity when compared to a 1,000-word text file. The <a href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/ai-video-generator-market-report\" rel=\"nofollow\">global market</a> for AI video generation is expected to grow at a 19.9% CAGR from 2024-2030, largely driven by social media platforms and the growing demand for video content over text. This could be largely driven by AI-generated advertising content, which is a feature now offered by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4825975-meta-platforms-connected-glasses-may-be-the-next-big-form-factor\">Meta Platforms</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4826710-alphabet-ups-the-capital-spend-for-ai-infrastructure-upside-is-priced-in\">Alphabet</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>). <a href=\"https://www.iab.com/news/nearly-90-of-advertisers-will-use-gen-ai-to-build-video-ads/\" rel=\"nofollow\">It is estimated</a> that GenAI-generated advertisements could make up 40% of all advertising content by 2026, largely driven by high-quality digital video ads. Another large growth driver could be the further adoption of edge AI applications like Meta AI Smart Glasses, which may require significant cloud storage to support the applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another large growth driver could be enterprise adoption of agentic AI, which remains in the early stages of mass deployment.

Accordingly, Seagate is not planning to add additional production, resulting in relatively lower capacity per HDD given the relative density of the next generation of HAMR drives. Essentially, the more capacity of the HAMR drive, the fewer total drives Seagate will have the capacity to produce. This tactic ensures that the firm maintains a certain level of scarcity to support pricing per terabyte.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, I’m forecasting Seagate to generate $2.7b in net revenue, with an adjusted EPS of $2.75/share. My forecast assumes continued improvements to gross and operating margins as Seagate capitalizes on its build-to-order model and the respective pricing mechanisms. Long-term, I’m expecting the strategy to continue to scale in the coming year as new AI data center capacity comes online and as more enterprises transition to utilizing GenAI and agentic AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seagate closed Q1 ’26 with $1.1b in cash &amp; equivalent and $5.7b in debt on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STX/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a> for a leverage ratio of 1.70x net debt/aEBITDA, a significant improvement from the previous quarter’s 2.04x leverage ratio. Seagate had $2.4b in available liquidity, providing the firm with significant financial flexibility to continue to lower its debt position.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seagate experienced some inventory build in Q1 ’26, reaching 106 days of inventory on hand, up from 102 days. This is likely the result of Seagate preparing to ramp up production of Moziac 3+ to meet market demand in calendar year 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"268\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Corporate Filings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"176\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-176184126343317_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Corporate Filings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks Related to Seagate</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bull Case</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seagate is positioned to execute its margin-accretive growth strategy by implementing incremental price increases through its long-term, build-to-order contracts.

One of the factors that may continue to drive new shareholder interest is that STX shares are among the <a href=\"https://www.slickcharts.com/sp500/performance\" rel=\"nofollow\">top performing stocks</a> in the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>) year-to-date 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the strong secular growth opportunity at hand, STX shares may continue to realize growth as the firm executes its margin-accretive growth strategy. Rationalizing the share price growth trajectory, I’m expecting the valuation multiple to normalize lower as the firm grows its adjusted EBITDA over the next two years. Given this factor, I am reiterating my Strong Buy rating for STX shares with a price target of $305/share at 15.17x eFY28 EV/aEBITDA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"200\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Corporate Filings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"131\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/16009792-17618412774483497_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Corporate Filings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Using the model: the valuation table above references my financial forecast in the firm’s “financial position” section and ties it to the stock’s historical trading premiums.

Moreover, Nvidia's rally accelerated after the company held its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509618-nvidia-creates-brave-new-world-as-its-chips-power-breakthroughs-across-industry-lines-gtc-dc\">GTC conference</a> this<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> week, bringing more visibility into the demand for Rubin, which seemingly positively surprised investors.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amid this massive CapEx boom, fueled by hyperscalers, however, we must ask ourselves some critical questions about whether Nvidia is still attractively valued, as it recently became the first company in the world to exceed a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510295-nvidia-makes-history-as-it-shatters-5t-market-cap-ceiling\">$5T valuation</a>. Therefore, in this article, we will explore why the current AI narrative may face some obstacles from a long-term perspective but also explain that despite these challenges, we see a good chance of the current melt-up continuing for quite some more time, given the underlying factors supporting this rally.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Previous Ratings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In general, in our previous assessments, we always carefully considered whether Nvidia's valuation was reasonable, considering future demand and relative valuation based on future earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2022 and throughout 2024, we had a clear picture that demand would significantly exceed supply and decided to remain optimistic. However, at the end of 2024/beginning of 2025, we believed that the future demand curve was becoming less visible and that the fundamental factors had peaked in their historical range. Therefore, at the end of last year, we decided to assign sell ratings in the range of $129.57 to $134.25. In hindsight, we must admit that we may have judged too early that the peak had been reached.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1793\" data-height=\"989\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nvidia Price 2021 to 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"353\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-176182160537717_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>TradingView</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4744133-nvidia-stock-would-you-believe-trees-dont-grow-to-the-sky\">latest article</a>, titled “Nvidia Stock: Would You Believe Trees Don't Grow To The Sky,” we based our cautious stance on data from some of the other largest historical CapEx cycles, such as the mainframe era in the late 1960s with International Business Machines Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\" title=\"International Business Machines Corporation\">IBM</a>) and the dot-com bubble with Cisco Systems, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSCO\" title=\"Cisco Systems, Inc.\">CSCO</a>), Lucent, and Nortel. In these cases, the capital expenditures of these companies exceeded 13% of total market spending, and Nvidia is now also starting to reach the same order of magnitude.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And although we saw a pullback earlier this year in April due to geopolitical risks, Nvidia has rebounded strongly. At the time of writing, we should perhaps have placed more emphasis on the echo among hyperscaler CEOs that the risk of underinvesting is much greater than that of overinvesting and that this rally indeed has even more room to run.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">No Signs Of A Slowdown (Yet)</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, we believe the results continue to be positively surprising. In terms of revenue, for example, data center revenue rose 56% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year and now stands at $41.10BN.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This also means that of Nvidia's total revenue, which was $46.74BN last quarter, data center revenue accounts for nearly 88% of Nvidia's total revenue. However, one area that surprised many investors was the resurgence of Nvidia's gaming segment, which rose from $2.88BN in the second quarter of last year to a new record of $4.29BN, partly due to the success of the launch of the Nintendo Co., Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTDOY\" title=\"Nintendo Co., Ltd.\">OTCPK:NTDOY</a>) Switch 2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2400\" data-height=\"1700\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nvidia Revenue Breakdown\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"453\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761821811038802_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>S&amp;P Market Intelligence, Author's Visuals</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a profitability perspective, Nvidia also appears to be running at full speed in the second quarter, with GAAP gross margins of 72.4% and operating margins of 60.8%, following a temporary dip in the previous quarter due to restrictions on H20 sales to China at that time. This means that operating income in the second quarter came in at $28.44BN, a 52.56% increase from the $18.64BN reported in the same quarter last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at core profitability, Nvidia is now generating $72.02BN in free cash flow on a TTM (trailing 12-months) basis according to the latest reports, or a multiple of nearly 70x, considering the market capitalization of $5.03T, which we believe is quite expensive but does not consider the future growth we will discuss later. A large portion of this free cash flow is used to buy back shares. The company has repurchased a whopping $42.05BN worth of shares over the past 12 months. In addition, the company approved a $60BN buyback plan in August, while at the time of reporting it still had $14.7BN in capacity left to repurchase shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2400\" data-height=\"1700\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nvidia Gross Margins and Operating Margins\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"453\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-1761823222122527_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>S&amp;P Market Intelligence, Author's Visuals</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margins are expected to improve in the second half of this year as the Blackwell ramp begins to level off. According to management, GAAP gross margins will be around 75% at the end of fiscal year 2026. As for Blackwell, we were surprised by the smooth ramp from Hopper, given the increased product launch frequency.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Melt-Up Has Arrived</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One thing is certain, and that is that we did not foresee the extent to which hyperscalers would defend their position in the lucrative data center industry when the shift from serial to parallel computing took place.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also did not expect Nvidia to use its own free cash flow to provide venture capital or investments to AI companies that depend on Nvidia's chips, such as Mistral, OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>), CoreWeave, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWV\" title=\"CoreWeave, Inc.\">CRWV</a>), and others, which we believe are capable of prolonging this capital cycle and even making it more extreme.

The key difference, however, is that current spending is largely financed with equity, cash flow, or venture capital rather than debt. This, in our view, leaves much more room for a potential bubble than in 2000, when companies faced credit risks as spreads widened until 2002.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We would also be wary of any bottlenecks that could arise in the coming months as Blackwell's rollout reaches critical mass, as both the scale and speed of the computer rollout are unprecedented.

More aggressive global estimates, as reported by <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-energy-use\" rel=\"nofollow\">the IEEE</a>, put demand at 347 TWh in 2030, which is equivalent to 44 nuclear reactors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After all, Nvidia and hyperscalers also run the risk that energy costs, which are part of input costs, could make AI implementation even less profitable at a time when LLM providers such as OpenAI are already burning through cash on a large scale. By way of comparison, Nvidia, with a valuation of $5T, is currently worth much more than the entire <a href=\"https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/sector/energy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">energy sector</a>, which consists of 256 companies and has a valuation of $3.57T.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We believe that the market is also anticipating announced future developments in data centers, as companies have announced plans to deploy up to 120 GW of capacity. Essentially, we believe that the market may be underestimating the execution risk, as companies have already incorporated these massive CapEx cycles into their forecasts through 2030 and beyond, while active growth in data center capacity is only just beginning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"746\" data-height=\"465\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AI Data Center Deployment versus Announced Developments\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"399\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618292454413018_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Goldman Sachs, Aterio</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some Thoughts On Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the early stages of this AI boom, we were reasonably satisfied with Nvidia's valuation, as demand was extremely inelastic despite high trailing multiples and revenue growth forecasts were in the triple digits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Towards the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4640631-nvidia-stanley-druckenmiller-is-right-about-ai-rating-upgrade\">end of 2023</a>, for example, we gave a Strong Buy rating based on future multiples.

These estimates imply growth in estimated EBITDA from $127.58BN at the end of this year to $176.87BN, which prices in a lot of certainty for the realization of Rubin orders but seems quite reasonable to us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, at the DTC developer conference, Jensen Huang announced that Blackwell and Rubin together had <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/nvidias-huang-speak-washington-investors-look-hints-china-2025-10-28/\" rel=\"nofollow\">$500BN in orders</a> through the end of 2026 so far, which likely translates to $300BN in data revenue in calendar year 2026 alone. This also seems to be in line with Wall Street estimates, which may actually be conservative, with expected revenues of $206.13BN for fiscal year 2026 and $270.28BN for fiscal year 2027. To our understanding, these orders through 2026, while not guaranteed, are supported by the construction costs outside the Nvidia chips that hyperscalers have already committed to, including energy contracts, land transactions, network equipment, construction costs, and others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although many who speak of a bubble expect a downturn to occur soon, we believe it is more likely to be a story for 2027.

In this case, it may therefore be better to look at price action to determine when the cycle is about to turn, rather than waiting for news about hyperscalers starting to cut costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of valuation, we are uncomfortable paying 30x forward EV/EBITDA based on 2026 estimates, as we expect revenue normalization to continue after 2027, when hyperscalers and venture capitalists begin to evaluate the limitations and cost-effectiveness currently associated with AI. Furthermore, there remains considerable uncertainty about the cyclical nature of these CapEx cycles, which are driven by demand from hyperscalers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We serve as a reminder that not so long ago, in 2022, Nvidia faced a downturn of more than 66%, which in our view was also attributable to cyclical factors related to retail GPUs being used to mine cryptocurrencies at the time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2f1be3a957eeb723a0ccd917e7dfedf7.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2f1be3a957eeb723a0ccd917e7dfedf7.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2f1be3a957eeb723a0ccd917e7dfedf7.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2f1be3a957eeb723a0ccd917e7dfedf7.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2f1be3a957eeb723a0ccd917e7dfedf7.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2f1be3a957eeb723a0ccd917e7dfedf7.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2f1be3a957eeb723a0ccd917e7dfedf7.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2f1be3a957eeb723a0ccd917e7dfedf7.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2f1be3a957eeb723a0ccd917e7dfedf7.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the outlook remains stable, we would therefore be more prudent with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 21x 2027 for Nvidia. This would imply an enterprise value of $3.71T, which, after adjusting for $46.19BN worth of net debt, consisting largely of cash and cash equivalents, equates to a valuation of $3.76T or approximately $154 per share. This would still give investors some margin of safety in the event of a decline in spending or a stabilization of hardware spending in 2027 and 2028.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In our view, investors are paying a premium for uncertainty today, expecting this cycle to last much longer with higher growth rates than earlier in late 2023/early 2024, when you could buy the company at a discount for 16x forward EV/EBITDA as investors were factoring in the possibility of a downturn in hyperscaler CapEx spend. Even more recently, in April 2025 during the trade war, Nvidia's multiple compressed all the way down to 18x EV/EBITDA on a forward basis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Is This Time Different?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our skepticism about this broader AI rally is mainly based on the idea that right now, as most venture-backed AI companies like OpenAI scale up, losses are also growing at an alarming rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OpenAI, for example, with ChatGPT as one of the most widely used AI tools available, is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/openais-first-half-revenue-rises-16-about-43-billion-information-reports-2025-09-30/\" rel=\"nofollow\">expected to burn</a> through $8BN in cash this year alone and will double this cash consumption to $17BN next year. Furthermore, according to certain sources, they expect to burn <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/06/openai-business-to-burn-115-billion-through-2029-the-information.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">through $115BN</a> in cash through 2029 and are not expected to have positive free cash flow until 2029. In contrast, the company generated an estimated $4.3BN in revenue in the first half of 2025, or $8.6BN on an annualized basis, although it is targeting $13BN in revenue for 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This reminds us of the Metaverse project, in which Meta had invested <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/chart/29236/operating-loss-of-metas-reality-labs-division/?srsltid=AfmBOoocNguh2NuVvTCRR_h-REvGYAewMtP06CjDxHT8JpTKEP18-vKw\" rel=\"nofollow\">approximately $70BN</a> in its \"Reality Labs\" at one point, while revenue at the end of 2024 was still only about $2.35BN on an annualized basis. While, on the one hand, we consider the marginal utility of OpenAI's products to be much greater than that of the Metaverse project, it remains to be seen how much revenue these services will actually generate, whether it will even be profitable to do so in terms of unit economics, and how fast and difficult the adoption phase will actually be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"575\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Goldman Sachs OpenAI Unit Economics\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"288\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52756760-17618304070137444_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Goldman Sachs</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To return once again to the parallel with the dot-com bubble: unlike in the late 1990s, when there was a veritable rush to float cash-guzzling technology companies such as Pets.com, much of the current waste and losses remain opaque, as a large proportion of it is financed by venture capital in private entities.

Although Jensen Huang recently emphasized <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">at GTC</a> that part of Blackwell will be built in the US, for example at the new TSMC factories in Arizona, SK hynix Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HXSCF\" title=\"SK hynix Inc.\">OTCPK:HXSCF</a>) in <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/03/05/news-tsmcs-100-billion-u-s-investment-puts-pressure-on-samsung-and-sk-hynixs-next-move/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Indiana</a>, or Foxconn Technology Co., Ltd. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FXCOF\" title=\"Foxconn Technology Co., Ltd.\">OTCPK:FXCOF</a>) in Texas, we believe that dependence on the Asian supply chain remains crucial, as high bandwidth memory (HBM) is mainly produced in Asia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, Nvidia remains dependent on Taiwan for advanced packaging (CoWoS) and currently still has to send chips produced in the United States <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/nvidia-and-tsmc-produce-the-first-blackwell-wafer-made-in-the-u-s-chips-still-need-to-be-shipped-back-to-taiwan-to-complete-the-final-product\" rel=\"nofollow\">back to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>) in Taiwan.

The latest SEC report states that 35% of total revenue can be attributed to two customers.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>For the first half of fiscal year 2026, sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 20% of total revenue; and sales to a second direct customer, Customer B, represented 15% of total revenue, respectively, both of which were attributable to the Compute &amp; Networking segment. (SEC, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001045810/000104581025000209/nvda-20250727.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q2 Earnings Filing</a>).</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, we also cannot rule out competitive risks for Nvidia, as hyperscalers, given the current <a href=\"https://iot-analytics.com/leading-generative-ai-companies/\" rel=\"noopener\">market share of 94%</a> for discrete GPUs, are also keen to avoid dependence on Nvidia alone, which is seriously eating away at their bottom line. As for Nvidia's lead <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA\" rel=\"nofollow\">with CUDA</a> in the field of training models, this still appears to be very stable, given the lack of acceptance and momentum of other alternatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, in terms of inference, there are still AWS with <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-says-anthropic-will-use-1-million-of-its-custom-ai-chips-141829311.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trainium2 chips</a>, Google's TPUs, which they also use internally for training, and AMD's Instinct chips, which could eventually erode some of Nvidia's 92% market share in AI data center GPUs to <a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/2025/09/29/data-infrastructure/metas-infrastructure-evolution-and-the-advent-of-ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">counter vendor lock-in</a>. Although AMD is stepping up its efforts, it will remain difficult in the short to medium term to overcome some of Nvidia's physical advantages, such as InfiniBand and NVLink. On the other hand, there has been more interest in using AMD lately. For example, OpenAI <a href=\"https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1260/amd-and-openai-announce-strategic-partnership-to-deploy-6-gigawatts-of-amd-gpus\" rel=\"nofollow\">recently announced</a> that it plans to use 6 gigawatts of AMD computing power.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, demand for Blackwell appears to be surprisingly high, and we are also pleasantly surprised by the visibility of demand for Rubin. Interest among hyperscalers remains high but is likely to be quite volatile in the future, as the AI narrative may encounter some obstacles along the way in terms of questions about economic aspects, energy supply, and the overall pace of adoption and implementation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We are convinced that AI will eventually transform industries in terms of automation, but the pace of adoption and implementation remains highly uncertain, as LLM providers continue to <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/03/anthropic_funding/\" rel=\"nofollow\">spend exponentially</a> more money as they expand their capacity. Nevertheless, we are not so sure that we can expect a downturn in Nvidia's underlying fundamentals before 2026, given the current commitments already made by hyperscalers.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, this melt-up could continue for a while, as the factors driving the rally remain favorable. In our opinion, an entry point with a reasonable margin of safety around $154 per share would be interesting until there is more clarity about the acceptance of AI and the improvement of unit economics at the implementation level. We therefore assign Nvidia at Hold.</p>",

Joining us now to discuss, Andrew Kelvin, Managing Director and Head of Canadian and Global Rates Strategy at TD Securities.</p> <p>Great to have you back on the program.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> Thank you for having me.</p> <p><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> Strong indication here. I know this was the call from TD Securities heading into this. We get a 25 basis point cut, and that's it. That's the end. They've hit their terminal rate, he's indicating pretty strongly there. What would it take to move them off that sideline?</p> <p><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> Yeah, I will say I was a little bit surprised they were as explicit as they were about expecting that they were done with this easing cycle at this level. I would have thought they would have been a little bit more cagey about it, maybe preserve a little bit more optionality for future meetings. But I think the fact that they were so transparent about how they're viewing the future policy path tells you that there's a very, very high bar for them to cut rates again in December. Presumably, this has some sort of relationship to the upcoming federal budget, which is expected broadly to be stimulative. And it would make sense if you're the central bank to not be easing immediately after a rather stimulative budget.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, in order to get them off of this hold that they've sort of communicated they're in, the answer is really simple. The governor was saying that if conditions change, they will reevaluate their path, which is what you would both hope and expect. December, I feel pretty comfortable with the idea that December is a hold. They would not have been as explicit in their communication if they thought there was a reasonable chance of a December cut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And again, it has that sort of proximity to the budget. Even January, it's not clear to me that we're going to have a good indication as to what the stimulative impacts of that budget will be. If the economy is flagging a little bit in January, we will still have the potential boost coming from announced stimulus into 2026 to comfort policymakers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But if we get into the spring-- so I'm really looking at March, April, June meetings-- and growth is not above its trend rate, if we're still seeing excess capacity in the economy grow, at that point the Bank of Canada, I think, will have to reconsider if this is, in fact, the floor for interest rates in this cycle. And if it turns out that the drag on the economy from the trade dispute with the United States is a little bit worse, if trading conditions with the United States become worse than they are today, that would be something that would cause them to reconsider.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And when I say worse than they are today, I'm not talking about just that sort of presumptive 10% additional reciprocal tariff. I'm talking about something that's more broadly punitive for a wider swath of the Canadian economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> Seem to be in a bit of a tough place because they are recognizing, of course, that they can't solve a trade war just through monetary policy. But sometimes a trade war can send prices higher, but a weaker economy, they think all of that weighs out, keeps prices in check. Are they being a little too optimistic on inflation being contained, considering everything we're facing?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> The reason-- I think it's actually a very reasonable set of forecasts they have. And I would say that on both the growth and inflation side. We can't solve a change in our trading relationship with monetary policy. What monetary policy can do is smooth that adjustment. It can make that adjustment less painful, which is why these sorts of moves are appropriate in my mind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of how inflation is going forward, I think the reason why I'm pretty comfortable with the idea inflation will be contained around 2%-- I never want to put a firm 2.0, so somebody can point their finger at me and say I'm wrong if it's 2.1.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To me, a perhaps overlooked thing in the structural change the Canadian economy is going under right now is the change in population growth. We had obviously very strong population growth in recent years, which is one of the factors that helped contribute to rising rents, rising shelter prices broadly. If we are going to remain in an environment where population growth is very, very weak, close to 0, we shouldn't have those same upward pressures on shelter prices. We shouldn't have those same upward pressures on rents.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And shelter's a huge part of the CPI basket. So if we're going to be in an environment where population growth is very weak, that should prevent runaway shelter price inflation. And that in and of itself should be enough to keep inflation around 2%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> Now, you mentioned the structural changes that we're undergoing because of the trade tensions and how the relationship is probably not going to be the same going forward. Well, it's not the same right now with the US. Governor Macklem mentioned it as well. Once we get through these structural changes, what does our economy look like on the other side?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> So it's probably an economy where the level of activity in the economy is just lower than it otherwise would have been. The way I tend to think about these things is you have a drag on growth in year 1 and 2. And even if you see growth return to its previous levels, you still have this sort of permanent gap between where the level of activity could have been and where you are now. And additionally, they did highlight that they look at these changing trade relationships as something that will drag on potential GDP. So having weaker terms of-- weaker trading conditions, weaker ability to trade with the US, less open market access is something that will drag potentially permanently on Canadian growth in their mind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So they see us transitioning to a lower-growth economy due to the fact that we will have less open trading conditions with the US going forward, just assuming that the current conditions move forward. If we are able to strike some sort of a grand bargain and go back to the world the way it was, in November, just in terms of what the actual tariffs charged are, what the actual market access is, obviously, a lot of that drag sort of disappears, and we can return to that previous economic trajectory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One point I would just make, though, is one of the values of a trade deal is it provides certainty. Businesses can look at the trade deal, trust that the terms of market access will remain constant, and make investments and decisions with the long term in mind. Going forward, even if we get a deal in the next day, week, month, quarter, year, whatever--</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> We had a deal under the first Trump administration, right?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> So yeah, pick your time horizon. I don't think people will be quite as willing to just accept that this will be a long-term deal, which they were in the first USMCA. I think when the first USMCA was signed, people had assumed that that deal would hold. And I'm quite certain-- I probably came on your show and said in 2024, I was like, well, Donald Trump signed USMCA one, so surely he won't tear it up. And then fast forward to today and he has largely moved away from that deal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So it is something where we probably never fully unring that bell. It probably does speak to an economy where, absent other positive developments, we're in a bit more of a slow-growth environment, which is probably why you see the federal government so focused on taking measures to boost productivity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> Talk about that. I mean, that puts a lot of pressure on next week's federal budget, doesn't it, to show us something that this economy needs? What do we need to see from that budget?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> The budget is probably having too much asked of it at this point. The federal government is in a fairly enviable position, just in that 15 to 20 years of reasonably responsible fiscal policy in Canada. I mean that the governments over in the post-pandemic era have had a lot of fiscal room. Our net federal debt to GDP is quite low. So this government can come out with a 2, 2.5% budget deficit as a share of GDP without really roiling markets. And I think markets are quite positioned for what could be quite a large deficit in this upcoming budget.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problem I think the government faces here is that a lot of the measures that they would like to take to boost productivity-- cutting red tape. Their first bill, the first signature bill they passed when they came into parliament before the summer recess was about streamlining projects of national importance. And that's all well and good, cutting red tape is all-- I've never heard an argument for red tape. I'm sure it exists, but no one's ever said it to me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That sort of effort is the sort of thing that can pay dividends down the road. Cutting approval timelines to make sure that shovels can be in the ground within two years or five years, or whatever the timeframe is is a great thing that can help boost productivity and growth once those shovels start hitting the ground and once the project's complete, whether it's a mine, a port expansion, a nuclear plant, what have you. The problem is, I don't see how any of these things are terribly helpful in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So I think the real task for this budget is they have to balance three things. They have to balance setting the stage to actually boost future productivity growth. They need to take some measures to fill the gap in aggregate demand that is going to persist into 2026, because I think if the government comes out and their entire budget is focused around measures to boost activity four, five, six years down the line-- again, thinking long term is great, but it doesn't help the economy in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> You want to see something right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> So they'll need something to help bridge that gap between when these long-term capital investments start to produce growth and the trouble the economy is facing in adjusting right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And the third thing they'll need to do is probably follow through a little bit on some of the \"spend less\" parts of their slogan. They have talked about cutting the size of the civil service, reducing operating costs, whether it be through more use of technology or reducing consultants, whatever the mode they do is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They have to balance all these three things, and they don't all pull in the same direction. There's a balance between whether to invest for the long term or the short term. Do want to spend for the long term or the short term? How much new spending do you want to have that is effectively offset by operating cost reductions? Because there is no free cost cutting. Anytime you reduce operating costs for a government, that does have negative implications for the economy. Maybe it's not one for one. There is no pure dead weight that can just be cut here.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.moneytalkgo.com/video/boc-signals-its-rate-cut-cycle-may-be-finished/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p>",

The performance reflects an approximated 7% increase in pricing as Hershey has raised prices to account for cocoa inflation, only slightly offset by a small -1% decline in sales volume.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the decline, the segment’s sales volume performance is very strong in my opinion – I also <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834762-mondelez-focusing-on-cocoa-deflation-after-weak-q3-rating-upgrade\">covered</a> Mondelez International, Inc.'s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDLZ\" title=\"Mondelez International, Inc.\">MDLZ</a>) Q3 results, noting a much more significant -4.6% sales volume decline for the competitor. Mondelez noted higher than expected demand elasticity in the face of price increases, but Hershey’s demand has remained very resilient despite similar pricing actions. Hershey noted a more than 10 basis point retail market share gain in <a href=\"https://hershey.gcs-web.com/static-files/cc69098f-155b-4ecd-827b-6d4a9850e4e5\" rel=\"nofollow\">prepared remarks</a> with strength in the Jolly Rancher, Hershey, Cadbury, and Reese’s brands. Product innovation has driven strong retail-level sales, highlighting Hershey's strong brand portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">North America Salty Snacks also had a strong performance; the segment’s sales grew by 10.0% to $321 million, reflecting a massive 11 percentage point sales volume gain. Hershey’s promotional timing, media investments, and product innovation drove the segment’s good performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hershey's revenues also performed well in other markets; the International segment showed 12.1% revenue growth to $245 million, reflecting a 7% pricing increase and 6% growth in sales volume. Shipment timings in Europe and Mexico did contribute a part of the good volume gain as shipments moved from Q4 to Q3; underlying consumption seems to still have been subdued due to demand elasticity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hershey does note that the company has had a disappointing early Halloween performance, related by the company to warmer weather and seasonality effects. The overall sales signal from the Q3 report was still strong; on top of a strong Q3 across segments, Hershey raised the 2025 sales growth outlook to 3% from <em>at least 2%</em> previously.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margins Have Been a Compromise</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hershey’s margins suffered massively in Q3 due to significantly higher cocoa prices – profitability has been a clear compromise as the industry’s pricing power is clearly limited in the face of demand elasticity. The adjusted gross margin showed an 850 basis point decline to 31.8%, reflecting a mix of higher cocoa prices and tariffs. Higher input costs were not even nearly offset by Hershey’s price actions. Mondelez did show an even more significant 1010 basis point gross margin drop in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike Mondelez, though, Hershey didn’t manage SG&amp;A as prudently – Hershey’s operating expenses grew by 1.5% year-on-year. Adjusted operating income ended up declining by -35.4% to $423 million. The quarter’s $1.30 adjusted EPS still beat Wall Street’s consensus by $0.24 due to already subdued expectations in the current inflationary operating environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability issues shift the focus to cocoa deflation. As I also wrote in my article on Mondelez, cocoa prices have started to fall back due to improved crops. Cocoa futures stand at $6000 per tonne at the time of writing, at less than half the December 2024 peak. The 2025/26 season is expected to already show a cocoa supply surplus; while cocoa prices remain significantly high, recent months’ deflation should start to provide a pathway for a margin recovery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hershey’s earnings recovery is still likely to be very gradual, being largely dependent on competitors’ pricing, new developments in the cocoa market, and consumers’ demand elasticity going forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hershey’s Valuation Has a Fair Margin of Safety</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I updated my discounted cash flow (DCF) model for Hershey. I very slightly raised my revenue estimates, now implying a 2024-2034 CAGR of 2.7%. I now estimate the EBIT margin to stabilize at 21% from 2029 forward, suggesting a margin recovery in the 2026-2028 period due to cocoa deflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hershey’s cash flow conversion should stay healthy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1076\" data-height=\"338\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"fair value estimate hershey stock\" width=\"640\" height=\"201\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/52204265-17618412978158083_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">DCF Model <span>(Author's Calculation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The estimates put Hershey’s fair value at $210.9, 23% above the stock price at the time of writing.

I again assume quite a modest 15% long-term debt-to-equity ratio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For cost of equity, I use the 10-year bond <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y?s=us10y\">yield of 4.09%</a> as the risk-free rate. The equity risk premium of 4.62% is Professor Aswath Damodaran’s most recent July <a href=\"https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/\" rel=\"nofollow\">estimate</a> for the US. I have kept the beta estimate at 0.45. With a liquidity premium of 0.2%, the cost of equity stands at 6.37% and the WACC at 5.91%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hershey reported strong sales in Q3 as consumer demand stayed surprisingly resilient amid significant cocoa inflation. The company’s main brands are performing strongly. Yet, the quarter also underlines the industry’s struggles; margins were again a compromise to protect sales as Hershey’s earnings plummeted. Recent months’ cocoa deflation should start to rebound earnings, but at an uncertain timeframe.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">HSY stock has a fair margin of safety in its valuation, and I remain at a Hold rating.</p>",

At present, the forward revenue growth estimate by sell-side analysts is almost 15%, which is exactly the mid-point of the range. Gross margin, on the other hand, is expected to drop, but economies of scale would allow MSFT to retain its operating margin flat—something that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4823670-amazon-2-reasons-why-its-not-a-good-ai-play\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4823670-amazon-2-reasons-why-its-not-a-good-ai-play\" target=\"_blank\">other peers</a> in the cloud infrastructure space might have a hard time achieving.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>(...) we expect revenue of USD 79.5 billion to USD 80.6 billion or growth of 14% to 16%. We expect COGS of USD 26.35 billion to USD 26.55 billion or growth of 21% to 22%. And operating expense of USD 17.3 billion to USD 17.4 billion, growth of 7% to 8%. Operating margins should be relatively flat year-over-year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality.</p> <p>Source: MSFT Q1 2026 Earnings Transcript</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the Q1 report falls in the category of better-than-anticipated, and the initial negative share price reaction is likely linked to one of the issues that was highlighted a few months ago, namely the beginning of the market to price-in flat operating margins going forward. In spite of all the good news around MSFT in recent months, this is also the reason why the share price remained flat over the past three months as the Nasdaq Composite Index skyrocketed by 16%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Big Picture</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nothing has changed over the past few months, and I retain my Hold rating on MSFT due to the issues mentioned in my last analysis. Although the Q1 report was quite good, I anticipate a muted share price reaction to other such earnings releases in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, long-term investors who are willing to forego short-term underperformance and retain a long position in the company should do their best not to miss the forest for the trees. In other words, quarterly numbers could go in either direction in relation to the short-term analysts' estimates, but what truly matters for MSFT now is to remain positioned as a leader in generative AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, the section about OpenAI in each earnings release is becoming increasingly important. In the latest report, it was the details given about the new agreement with OpenAI as it undergoes a very important restructuring process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the AI landscape evolves, OpenAI and Microsoft needed to alter their existing relationship in order for each one of them to achieve more freedom in certain areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a nutshell, there are two entities: a non-profit one called OpenAI Foundation and a for-profit organization called OpenAI Group PBC. MSFT holds a stake in the latter, which is <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/next-chapter-of-microsoft-openai-partnership/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://openai.com/index/next-chapter-of-microsoft-openai-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\">valued</a> at $135bn. According to MSFT management, the company has already 10x-ed their investments made in the company since 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the value of MSFT's stake is bound to continue increasing, there have been a number of announcements made regarding the relationship.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Firstly, MSFT would continue to have exclusive IP rights and Azure exclusivity on API (Application Programming Interface) products, and OpenAI has committed to an incremental $250bn investment in Azure services. The new structure also gives MSFT rights to OpenAI's IP and models through 2032 or once an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is declared and verified by an expert panel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Secondly, MSFT can now pursue AGI on its own or with third parties, and the same goes for some products developed by OpenAI. For non-API products, OpenAI will be free to use any other cloud provider as it sees fit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, this new organization gives OpenAI some freedom to more easily raise capital and pursue an IPO in the coming years.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w640\" alt=\"OpenAI upcoming IPO\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"619\" height=\"148\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although ChatGPT is still leading by a very wide margin in terms of market share, the competition within the AI-powered products will intensify significantly in the coming years, with all major players announcing significant <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510958-alphabet-signals-91b-93b-2025-capex-amid-ai-driven-growth-surge\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510958-alphabet-signals-91b-93b-2025-capex-amid-ai-driven-growth-surge\" target=\"_blank\">increases</a> in investments. Thus, the deal with OpenAI could give MSFT a much-needed freedom in further developing its own frontier models. It also opens up the space for other cloud infrastructure vendors to contract workloads from OpenAI.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Microsoft remains one of my favorite picks within the cloud and software sector, alongside my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821698-oracle-blockbuster-earnings-separating-the-business-from-the-stock-price\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821698-oracle-blockbuster-earnings-separating-the-business-from-the-stock-price\" target=\"_blank\">long-time favorite</a>—Oracle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>). Having said that, recent events confirm my fears that the share price does not offer much upside in the near term as investor expectations have already priced-in much of the business momentum. More importantly, however, the latest earnings release shows that quarterly figures are far less relevant for Microsoft's future than the company's strategic positioning in generative AI.</p>",

A favorable backdrop of positive global growth, falling interest rates across the developed markets, and a lack of pronounced negative<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> news fueled a surge in investors’ appetite for risk. Most notably, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) cut rates by a quarter point in September, and the markets anticipated that additional easing could be in store over the months ahead.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors were further cheered by positive corporate earnings reports and the relatively limited initial economic impact from tariffs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These developments helped propel major equity indexes to a series of all-time highs. The United States led the way higher behind renewed enthusiasm about the artificial intelligence theme and the technology sector more broadly. Small- cap stocks, which benefited from the improving interest rate outlook and investors’ preference for risk, performed particularly well. The emerging markets were another top performer, with China registering an impressive gain amid revived optimism about the country’s economic outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The global fixed-income markets also produced positive returns, reflecting the increasingly favorable shift in Fed policy. Longer-term debt and credit-oriented categories generally provided the best results.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Contributors and detractors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Asset allocation was a slight detractor from the fund’s relative performance in the quarter. An underweight in U.S. large-cap stocks and corresponding overweights in defensive equities, mid caps, and the international markets were the primary drivers of the modest shortfall. On the other hand, an overweight in stocks and underweight in bonds positioned the fund to capitalize on the favorable market environment. Diversification into a real assets portfolio—which was helped by its position in metals and mining stocks—also contributed to performance. An overweight in emerging-market bonds in the fixed-income portfolio was a further positive.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio changes</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment conditions remained broadly positive at the close of the period, highlighted by ongoing optimism related to economic conditions and global central bank policy. However, valuations have become fairly full across many areas of the equity and fixed-income markets. With this in mind, we maintain a diversified portfolio designed to hold up through a wide range of possible outcomes. We think it’s better to keep a long-term view rather than trying to chase returns in specific categories. We believe this approach should hold the fund in good stead over time, and we think its merits may become increasingly apparent if the market backdrop becomes less favorable than investors are anticipating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Average annual total returns<sup>1,2,3 %</sup> </h2> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Qtd</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Ytd</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>1 yr</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>3 yr</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>5 yr</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>10 yr</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Since inception</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Inception date</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Class R6 without sales charge 4.39</p></td> <td><p>11.20</p></td> <td><p>8.56</p></td> <td><p>13.03</p></td> <td><p>7.12</p></td> <td><p>7.88</p></td> <td><p>7.03</p></td> <td><p>11/7/13</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Class R4 without sales charge 4.39</p></td> <td><p>11.02</p></td> <td><p>8.31</p></td> <td><p>12.73</p></td> <td><p>6.85</p></td> <td><p>7.66</p></td> <td><p>6.81</p></td> <td><p>11/7/13</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>S&amp;P Target Date 2025 Index 4.54</p></td> <td><p>11.64</p></td> <td><p>9.41</p></td> <td><p>13.31</p></td> <td><p>7.47</p></td> <td><p>7.66</p></td> <td><p>6.80</p></td> <td><p>—</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>John Hancock 2025 Lifetime 4.98</p></td> <td><p>11.98</p></td> <td><p>8.57</p></td> <td><p>13.41</p></td> <td><p>7.38</p></td> <td><p>8.57</p></td> <td><p>7.69</p></td> <td><p>—</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Target-date 2025 category 4.28</p></td> <td><p>8.91</p></td> <td><p>6.58</p></td> <td><p>11.93</p></td> <td><p>6.05</p></td> <td><p>6.83</p></td> <td><p>—</p></td> <td><p>—</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Expense</strong><strong>ratios</strong>4</p></td> <td><p><strong>Gross</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Net </strong><strong>(what </strong><strong>you</strong><strong> pay)</strong></p></td> <td> <p><strong>Contractual</strong></p> <p><strong>through</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Class R6</p></td> <td><p>0.70%</p></td> <td><p>0.35%</p></td> <td><p>12/31/2025</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Class R4</p></td> <td><p>1.05%</p></td> <td><p>0.60%</p></td> <td><p>12/31/2025</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td>The performance data shown represents past performance, which does not guarantee future results.

The portfolio is subject to the same risks as the underlying funds and exchange-traded funds in which it invests: Stocks and bonds can decline due to adverse issuer, market, regulatory, or economic developments; foreign investing, especially in emerging markets, has additional risks, such as currency and market volatility and political and social instability; the securities of small companies are subject to higher volatility than those of larger, more established companies; and high-yield bonds are subject to additional risks, such as increased risk of default. Each portfolio’s name refers to the approximate retirement year of the investors for whom the portfolio’s asset allocation strategy is designed. The portfolios with dates further off initially allocate more aggressively to stock funds. As a portfolio approaches and passes its target date, the allocation will gradually migrate to more conservative, fixed-income funds. The principal value of each portfolio is not guaranteed, and you could lose money at any time, including at, or after, the target date. Liquidity—the extent to which a security may be sold or a derivative position closed without negatively affecting its market value, if at all—may be impaired by reduced trading volume, heightened volatility, rising interest rates, and other market conditions.

One of the primary ingredients of the AI economy is technologies that lie at the very nucleus of data transfer, namely connective tech, including solutions for the 5G and 6G networks. And for investors who would like to get exposure to the theme, there are a few vehicles to consider, including the Defiance Connective Technologies ETF (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SIXG\" title=\"Defiance Connective Technologies ETF\">SIXG</a></span>), a passively managed exchange-traded fund that we will be discussing today.</p> <h2 id=\"basics-of-the-defiance-connective-technologies-etf\">Basics Of The Defiance Connective Technologies ETF</h2> <ul> <li>SIXG is a passively managed ETF with an inception date of March 4, 2019.</li> <li>The ETF represents the Technology subclass of the Sector Equity class.</li> <li>Defiance ETFs, LLC is the investment adviser, while Penserra Capital Management LLC is the sub-adviser.</li> <li>As of October 29, 2025, SIXG's assets under management were at $695.36 million, which is almost 5.4x the median AUM for the subclass.</li> <li>SIXG's expense ratio is 0.30%, which is notably below the median ER for the subclass of 0.55%.</li> </ul> <h2 id=\"what-does-sixg-do\">What Does SIXG Do?</h2> <p>As we know from the factsheet available on the Defiance ETFs <a href=\"https://www.defianceetfs.com/sixg/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.defianceetfs.com/sixg/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, SIXG is a thematic, passively managed vehicle offering exposure to \"connective technology enablers crucial to the AI revolution,\" namely, to the 5G and 6G tech that</p> <blockquote><p>...provide the infrastructure needed for AI applications that demand high-speed connectivity, low latency, and massive data processing capabilities.</p></blockquote> <p>Importantly, established in March 2019, SIXG underwent changes in 2024.</p> <ul> <li>First, before July 22, 2024, SIXG <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/defiance-announces-name-and-ticker-symbol-change-fivg-sixg-defiance-connective\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/defiance-announces-name-and-ticker-symbol-change-fivg-sixg-defiance-connective\" target=\"_blank\">was known as</a> the Defiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF and had a ticker FIVG.</li> <li>Second, on September 23, 2024, SIXG started tracking the BlueStar® Connective Technologies Index that replaced the BlueStar 5G Communications Index. The changes were <a href=\"https://www.marketvector.com/insights/index-updates/rule-name-ticker-changes-of-bfivg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://www.marketvector.com/insights/index-updates/rule-name-ticker-changes-of-bfivg\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> by MarketVector <span id=\"jS$308\" class=\"j3\">Indexes</span> in July 2024.</li> </ul> <p>As explained on page 14 of the prospectus:</p> <blockquote><p>Effective September 23, 2024, the Fund’s investment objective changed to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the BlueStar® Connective Technologies Index. Prior to September 23, 2024, the Fund’s investment objective was to track the total return performance, before fees and expenses, of the BlueStar 5G Communications Index. Performance shown for periods prior to September 23, 2024, is that of the BlueStar 5G Communications Index.</p></blockquote> <h3 id=\"-\"> </h3> <p>In essence, as we can see in the old and new index universe rules comparison in the press release, while these indices have quite a lot in common, the key differences are that the connective tech index also includes companies involved with \"the rollout of 5G, or 6G networks,\" while the previous one was focused on the 5G networks only. Plus, \"satellite-based internet technology/providers\" was added to the universe.</p> <p>Still, investors should understand that although the indices have rather similar premises, the performance that SIXG delivered prior to the strategy change, though certainly of use and not to be ignored, should be treated with caution, as it is not necessarily indicative of the ETF's potential.</p> <p>For context, my calculations show that the SIXG portfolio as of October 27, 2025, has just a 68.8% overlap with the FIVG portfolio <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4547652-fivg-etf-has-5g-theme-become-cheap-enough\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4547652-fivg-etf-has-5g-theme-become-cheap-enough\" target=\"_blank\">as of October 18</a>, 2022. Moreover, it is quite notable that the basket became substantially leaner, with 50 equities vs. 86 as of October 2022.</p> <h2 id=\"how-is-the-index-calibrated\">How Is The Index Calibrated?</h2> <p>As of October 2025, SIXG tracks the BlueStar® Connective Technologies Index, which features a modified market cap weighting scheme.</p> <p>As explained by the ETF, this index is composed of</p> <blockquote><p>... companies whose business activity, products, or services meet the technical standards for, are used in the development of, or are otherwise instrumental in the rollout of 5G, or 6G networks, and other connective technologies...</p></blockquote> <p>To qualify, they must generate no less than 50% of their revenues from a rather vast group of technologies that are detailed on page 9 of the prospectus:</p> <blockquote><p>The Fund defines Connective Technology Companies to include: (i) manufacturers of core carrier grade networking equipment, including cellular antennas, routers and related semiconductor devices, (ii) satellite-based internet technology manufacturers and providers, (iii) mobile network operators (“MNOs”), (iv) enhanced mobile broadband chips and smart phone manufacturers, (v) manufacturers of new radio technology, wireless network test and optimization equipment, and cloud computing equipment, (vi) manufacturers and providers of software defined networking or network functions virtualization - including companies that focus on network/cloud analytics and monitoring platforms, and (vii) cell tower or data center real estate investment trusts (“REITs”).</p></blockquote> <h2 id=\"what-returns-has-sixg-been-capable-of-delivering\">What Returns Has SIXG Been Capable Of Delivering?</h2> <p>Let us look at the returns the ETF delivered before and after its strategy was refocused from the 5G communications to the connective tech.</p> <p>First, from March 5, 2019, to September 22, 2024, SIXG has considerably underperformed the overall market as represented by the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVV\" title=\"iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF\">IVV</a>) as well as the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust ETF\">QQQ</a>).</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

IVV was selected as a benchmark by the author</em></p> <p>All in all, SIXG has a rather expectable performance for a vehicle heavy in growth stocks: it does excellent in bull markets and underperforms dismally when bears dictate the rules.</p> <h2 id=\"who-is-sixg-for-and-how-does-it-fit-in-a-portfolio\">Who Is SIXG For, And How Does It Fit In A Portfolio?</h2> <p>SIXG might be an ETF of choice for investors seeking to profit from the 5G and 6G themes and who believe that passively managed vehicles targeting the communication sector, like the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR® ETF Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLC\" title=\"The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR® ETF Fund\">XLC</a>), simply do not offer enough exposure to them.</p> <p>Sure, they should be very fond of the growth factor and have little to no interest in value stocks (they are still present in SIXG but have a rather modest impact on its returns), and understand the risks that high achievers with generous valuations come with.</p> <p>As to the popular core-satellite system, SIXG looks like a decent satellite holding, with a core of the portfolio possibly being either IVV or any other S&amp;P 500 ETF like the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VOO\" title=\"Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF\">VOO</a>), the SPDR® S&amp;P 500® ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR® S&amp;P 500® ETF\">SPY</a>), and the SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPLG\" title=\"SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® ETF\">SPLG</a>), or QQQ.</p> <p>Importantly, position sizing is always key when building a tech-focused portfolio from various thematic blocks, as high-beta baskets of growthier stocks can deliver quite sensitive losses when conditions turn gloomy (marked by too high inflation, shifts in monetary policy from dovish to hawkish regimes, an overall weak macro environment, etc.). So investors should have a clear understanding of what share of their portfolios they can allocate to higher-risk names and what they are planning to do if these stocks enter a long period of losses.</p> <p>For context, in 2022 (even though the strategy was a little different back then, there is still some overlap with the current one), the ETF, traded with a ticker FIVG, delivered a maximum drawdown of 30.8% (vs. IVV's 23.93%), and its loss for the year was 27.25% (vs. IVV's loss of 18.16%).</p> <h2 id=\"how-is-sixg-built\">How Is SIXG Built?</h2> <p>As of October 27, 2025, there were 52 holdings in the SIXG portfolio, including 50 equities, the First American Government Obligations Fund 12/01/2031 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FGXXX\" title=\"First American Government Obligations Fund Inst\">FGXXX</a>), and cash &amp; other, with the latter two accounting for 0.24%.</p> <p>The top holding was Apple Inc.

For the WA earnings yield, EYs for loss-making companies were removed.</em></p> <h3 id=\"size-and-value\"><strong>Size And Value</strong></h3> <ul> <li>With just three trillion-dollar companies in the portfolio (vs. nine in IVV), SIXG has a weighted average market cap about 2.4x smaller.</li> <li>Despite that, its portfolio appears much more generously valued, as illustrated by its smaller adjusted WA earnings yield, as well as much higher adjusted WA Price/Sales and Enterprise Value/EBITDA. This creates meaningful risks investors should be prepared for.</li> </ul> <h3 id=\"growth\"><strong class=\"highlighted_text\">Growth</strong></h3> <p>SIXG has a stronger weighted average forward earnings growth rate, which partly explains why its EY is quite low (and translates into an almost 36x Price/Earnings) compared to IVV, plus more than half of its net assets are allocated to companies with a B- Quant Growth grade or higher. Still, the S&amp;P 500 ETF is offering more appealing forward revenue and EBITDA growth rates.</p> <h3 id=\"quality\"><strong class=\"highlighted_text\">Quality</strong></h3> <p>Most of <span id=\"jS$2311\" class=\"j3\">SIXG's</span> holdings are high-quality companies with capital efficiency indicators and margins at quite healthy levels. However, IVV is considerably stronger here. For instance, it has a larger exposure to companies with a B- Quant Profitability grade or higher.</p> <h3 id=\"low-volatility\"><strong>Low Volatility</strong></h3> <p>SIXG is much more into high-beta stocks than IVV. The bull markets are a boon for high-beta names, as they tend to capture over 100% of the S&amp;P 500 ETF's upside, delivering impressive gains. However, their losses in bear markets can be rather painful.</p> <h2 id=\"sixg-risks\">SIXG Risks</h2> <p>Like any other theme-focused ETF favoring growthier tech names, SIXG has two key risks.</p> <h3 id=\"high-achiever-valuation-risk\"><strong>High-Achiever Valuation Risk</strong></h3> <p>Companies with strong growth prospects, lofty multiples, and high beta — exactly those that account for the bulk of the ETF's net assets — are extremely sensitive to periods of market stress. In other words, deterioration in macro conditions, including, for instance, too high inflation, can be detrimental for SIXG's performance, resulting in steep losses, with a good example being 2022 (back then, its maximum drawdown was 30.84%).</p> <h3 id=\"theme-popularity-risk\"><strong>Theme Popularity Risk</strong></h3> <p>There is a risk that the 5G/6G theme will become less and less popular with ETF investors, with asset flows switching to newer and more promising areas (i.e., pure-play AI-focused vehicles), even though the rise of the \"AI connectivity\" sub-theme might partly compensate for that.</p> <p>Still, the fact is, SIXG saw some impressive inflows in the past, with AUM <a href=\"https://www.defianceetfs.com/the-first-5g-etf-fivg-hits-1-billion-in-aum/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.defianceetfs.com/the-first-5g-etf-fivg-hits-1-billion-in-aum/\" target=\"_blank\">surpassing</a> $1 billion in January 2021.

Nvidia has crossed the $5 trillion valuation mark amidst the growing fears for the AI bubble.

The company has the potential to grow at least at a 30% angle, while the valuation has climbed to its fair value since my previous coverage.

Since then, the solid data center investment pipeline has pushed NVDA to become the world’s most valuable company. Apart from that, the AI frenzy is fueling the market bubble fears due to the circular large-scale investments between the main AI players. And because of the long-term nature of the investment plans, there will <span>always</span><span> </span>be skepticism about how many of those investments will break ground. In my view, the three-year horizon is quite a long-term period, as the dynamics of the trade disputes and geopolitical tensions cannot be really predicted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, let’s take a look at the current supply chain stance. TSMC projected mid-30% revenue growth due to the accelerating demand for AI and HPC chips from hyperscalers and AI-accelerator customers. The utilization of the leading-edge node is expected to be very high as the demand is surging. At the same time, the HBM supply is shaping up to be <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509111-sk-group-chairman-says-rapid-development-of-ai-data-centers-creating-bottlenecks\">tight,</a> with SK hynix Inc.

In addition, Amkor <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509068-amkor-outlines-7b-arizona-campus-investment-and-projects-double-digit-q4-revenue-growth\">increased</a> its total investments for the new advanced packaging and test campus in Arizona up to $7 billion. Going further, Vertiv Holdings Co (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VRT\" title=\"Vertiv Holdings Co\">VRT</a>) reported surging orders and a robust backlog due to the strong <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4506587-vertiv-surges-9-percent-after-earnings-beat-raised-guidance-on-soaring-ai-infrastructure\">AI-driven demand</a> for digital infrastructure solutions such as power management, cooling systems and integrated data center platforms. Overall, the demand is prominently outstripping supply, and Microsoft Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) forecasts show a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-09/microsoft-forecasts-show-data-center-crunch-persisting-into-2026?srnd=phx-technology\" rel=\"nofollow\">data center crunch</a> persisting into 2026 as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But apart from the AI bubble, the competitive landscape is rising over. Besides the ASICs' collusions, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) is progressing to be the most fearful alternative with a full-stack Helios rack-scale AI platform, which is believed to be on par with Vera Rubin. Both systems feature 72 GPUs onboard and are expected to enter mass production in the back half of 2026. Now, let’s recall AMD’s $500 billion data center AI accelerator TAM estimate in 2028.

And while I used to take the projections made by Nvidia’s executives with a grain of salt, the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4817296-nvidia-corporation-nvda-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">$3-4 trillion</a> in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade seems reasonable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But let’s stick to the $500 billion AI accelerator market size scenario, which is still a significant jump compared to some $130 billion in 2024. If we suppose that Nvidia would maintain around 60% market share, it suggests up to $300 billion in revenue from the data center segment in 2028, or circa 30% CAGR. Despite growing by 56% YoY in the second fiscal quarter of 2025, the company will come down to such a growth dynamic at some point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Data center segment revenue\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"578\" height=\"422\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Data center segment revenue <span>(Nvidia presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nonetheless, this projection is far more conservative compared to Jensen Huang’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510295-nvidia-makes-history-as-it-shatters-5t-market-cap-ceiling\">visibility</a> into half a trillion in sales for Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin through 2026. This figure most likely includes the partnership with OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>) to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia AI systems. Indeed, with the rollout of Blackwell Ultra systems, Nvidia is going to dominate the market in 2026 as well. However, we should discern the visibility from when this revenue is actually going to be recognized. And even if AMD comes up with a superior rack-scale platform, the point is that such a big market share is not going to dissipate any time soon. Because, as I wrote in my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797121-amd-from-an-alternative-to-an-equal\">latest piece</a> on AMD, the main advantage of Nvidia is in the timing between architectural generations. AMD opted for a new process technology for its MI350 series, which took time for the transition to the 3nm lithography.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, Nvidia switched to a double-die package, effectively doubling the performance of the Hopper generation while staying at the same process node. Moreover, Nvidia is planning to shift its roadmap to only an <a href=\"https://wccftech.com/nvidia-has-already-geared-up-to-challenge-big-tech-custom-ai-chip-ambitions/\" rel=\"nofollow\">eight-month gap</a> in production ramp-up, which could be highly beneficial, especially when the market for AI systems continues to be supply chain-restricted.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reversion angle</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Against the backdrop of the AI bubble fears, it’s hard to believe that a company worth nearly $5 trillion with a 50% stock price gain since the beginning of the year is fairly valued. I used to mention that a 30% growth reversion angle could bring the valuation of NVDA stock down to the low 20x in FY2028. Apparently, it went so much faster due to the rapid expansion of data center build-outs. And looking at the chart now, the company is trading at 33.4x forward P/E, which is slightly below the 3-year median of 33.6x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1019\" data-height=\"628\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Valuation of NVDA; P/E left; EPS right\" width=\"640\" height=\"394\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618269157259452_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Valuation of NVDA; P/E left; EPS right <span>(prepared by author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>*The two dotted lines represent one standard deviation above and below the median line.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, we can see that NVDA stock is clearly valued at its fair level, climbing from the bottom line of one standard deviation below the median from the time of my last piece. Basically, when you have a stock with the potential to grow at least by 30% and trading at a 30x multiple, it’s a good indication of a reasonable investment. I could confirm this with the following chart, which highlights that the earnings vector used moves in sync with the price performance dynamic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going forward, I prefer to stick with a 30% growth angle to form a more conservative scenario. I believe that NVDA stock has room for 30% multiple expansions for the next 12-month horizon, or up to 43x forward P/E ratio. Given the analyst forecast of $6.02 EPS next year, this indicates a $261 value per share, which stipulates a 25% upside potential.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Investment takeaways</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With superior computing power and deep optimization, Nvidia accelerators deliver the world's highest performance for AI workloads, benefiting from the NVLink technology. Apart from that, the company develops high-performance networking (InfiniBand and Spectrum-X) solutions that enable the interconnection of large-scale clusters, which is especially relevant when we are talking about data center projects in gigawatt measure. The CUDA software stack is another strength, which has effectively become the industry standard, enabling the adaptation of GPUs to solve a wide range of computational tasks. These three pillars help Nvidia to retain customers in its ecosystem, due to the lack of meaningful substitution offerings, at least until the end of 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apart from that, Nvidia is continuously teaming up with industry leaders to ensure its technology remains at the forefront amid the AI revolution. The scope of investment into data center build-outs is constantly growing, representing a strong growth potential visibility. The demand signals make tech giants spend relentlessly on artificial intelligence, with Microsoft planning to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510964-microsoft-outlines-fy26-capital-expenditure-acceleration-as-ai-demand-drives-80-percent-ai\">double</a> its data center footprint over the next 2 years, Meta signaling a strong Capex expansion, and Alphabet approaching $100 billion in investments for the year.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, I believe that NVDA deserves a Buy recommendation even at a $5 trillion market cap. It remains to be seen how much of that revenue visibility mentioned at the GTC will even be recognized in the following five quarters. But definitely, Nvidia has the potential to grow at least by 30% in the near term, which, against the backdrop of a low 30s valuation multiple, looks like a good entry point. And even with a conservative expectation for TAM potential, NVDA stock still has 25% upside for the next 12-month horizon.</p>",

Outside of China, where BEVs may be heavily subsidized and encouraged, automakers are now introducing BEVs more slowly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Governments, too, are rethinking policies meant to incentivize BEVs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seamless technology</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In truth, many buyers will be unaware that their 2026 RAV4 is powered by a combination of a gasoline engine and a battery-powered electric motor; the system smoothly and quietly (according to this writer’s experience during a test drive) produces an average fuel efficiency of up to 44 miles to the gallon, combined city and highway, according to Toyota’s estimate. The RAV4’s battery receives charge from the engine, meaning that it doesn’t need external charging.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A second RAV4 version, the plug-in hybrid, has a larger battery than the standard gas-electric and must be charged; it offers an emission-free, electric-only range of about 52 miles before the gasoline engine kicks in to power the vehicle in hybrid mode. The plug-in may be operated without charging as well, and can be driven in gas-electric hybrid mode exclusively.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2337\" data-height=\"1587\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"infographic\" width=\"640\" height=\"435\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"435\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Rise of gas electric hybrids <span>(Wards Intelligence)</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Toyota says the new RAV4 will be the first of its product line to feature the newest version of the Toyota Auto Multimedia system, which offers “faster, more responsive voice assistant; a new customizable home menu; and Toyota's first application of onboard 5G connectivity.” Toyota had been criticized for earlier infotainment systems that excluded Apple CarPlay and Android systems; the automaker has since changed course and allowed its system to be more easily paired and synced with smartphones.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Toyota builds a majority of its vehicles in North America, those imported from Canada and Mexico have been subject to the administration’s tariffs. The new RAV4 will be built primarily in Georgetown, Ky., and Cambridge, Ontario, with some models imported from Japan. Accordingly, Toyota in August said its operating profit for the fiscal year ended March 30 is estimated to be reduced to $21.7 billion, or 16.3%, from its prior forecast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Toyota shares shrugged off the guidance, rising about 15% since then while outperforming major market indices.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rising taxes</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, tariffs remain a major stumbling block in front of earnings growth. Toyota has formulated a response, however, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4827928-toyota-moving-forward-with-a-strategic-way-to-play-the-tariffs\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4827928-toyota-moving-forward-with-a-strategic-way-to-play-the-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\">which was outlined earlier this month</a> by Seeking Alpha analyst James Hires earlier this month. Bolstered by its vaunted financial strength, the automaker has elected to absorb a significant portion of the tariff burden by limiting price hikes that it otherwise might have taken. Last June, Toyota evidently increased prices by a smaller margin than those of competitors, thus improving its value proposition, which should help to drive sales.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1322\" data-height=\"760\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"car\" width=\"640\" height=\"368\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"368\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">2026 RAV4 plug-in hybrid version <span>(Toyota Motor)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, Toyota has told U.S. trade officials it is looking to export U.S.-made models to Japan, a move designed to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4508823-toyota-has-a-strategy-to-appease-the-trump-administration\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4508823-toyota-has-a-strategy-to-appease-the-trump-administration\" target=\"_blank\">“appease” the U.S. administration</a> and help redress the trade deficit with Japan, which was about $70 billion in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the Tokyo Mobility Show this week, the automaker took the wraps off a BEV concept of the next-gen Corolla compact sedan, the best-selling model in its history, with more than 55 million manufactured since the nameplate was introduced in 1966. The show car attracted rave reviews from journalists, one of whom said it <a href=\"https://www.motortrend.com/news/toyota-corolla-concept-tokyo-show-first-look\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.motortrend.com/news/toyota-corolla-concept-tokyo-show-first-look\" target=\"_blank\">was “seriously cool.” </a> While it wasn’t clear when the production version of the Corolla would be introduced, Japanese carmakers usually don’t wait long after the concept is revealed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reports on the new Corolla say it will have more interior space, made possible by a new generation of engines that are more compact and powerful than current models. The model may accommodate batteries, hybrids, or possibly alternative fuels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">“The Corolla is a global car, so it has to meet different powertrain requirements in different regions,” Chief Engineer Toru Fukushima <a href=\"https://www.autonews.com/toyota/an-toyota-new-corolla-concept-ev-hybrid-2025-japan-mobility-show-1028/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.autonews.com/toyota/an-toyota-new-corolla-concept-ev-hybrid-2025-japan-mobility-show-1028/\" target=\"_blank\">told Automotive News</a> at a pre-show briefing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bullish on TM ADRs</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My bullish investment thesis is based on a number of core factors, some of which are reflected in the new RAV4. First of all is operating discipline, which reflects a relentless pursuit of researching those traits and features in a vehicle that consumers prioritize and delivering them in an affordable package.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A second key factor is what has proven to be a shrewd strategic direction with regard to electrification, that's a gradual migration toward zero emission that currently emphasizes gas-electric hybrid powertrains—exemplified by the decision to offer the latest RAV4 as an all-hybrid product. Since the 1990s, when the first <a href=\"https://pressroom.toyota.com/driving-innovation-celebrating-25-years-of-the-toyota-prius/#:~:text=First%20Generation:%202001%20%E2%80%93%202003,benchmark%20for%20eco%2Dsensitive%20driving.\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://pressroom.toyota.com/driving-innovation-celebrating-25-years-of-the-toyota-prius/#:~:text=First%20Generation:%202001%20%E2%80%93%202003,benchmark%20for%20eco%2Dsensitive%20driving.\" target=\"_blank\">gas-electric hybrid was introduced in Toyota Prius</a>, the company has been improving, tweaking, and optimizing its Hybrid Synergy Drive, while many of its competitors—now to their disadvantage—bypassed the technology or deemed it of secondary importance.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_7a421f0d25d355e23028a748f048c9f2.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_7a421f0d25d355e23028a748f048c9f2.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_7a421f0d25d355e23028a748f048c9f2.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_7a421f0d25d355e23028a748f048c9f2.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_7a421f0d25d355e23028a748f048c9f2.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_7a421f0d25d355e23028a748f048c9f2.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_7a421f0d25d355e23028a748f048c9f2.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_7a421f0d25d355e23028a748f048c9f2.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_7a421f0d25d355e23028a748f048c9f2.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, the automaker’s policy of investing in the development of multiple propulsion pathways—such as plug-in hybrids, hydrogen, batteries, as well as internal combustion—enables Toyota to commercialize its models in a multitude of global markets and for different consumer groups.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Toyota’s <a href=\"https://dbrs.morningstar.com/research/463201/morningstar-dbrs-confirms-toyota-motor-corporation-at-aa-low-trend-remains-stable#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20Toyota%20benefits%20from%20its,and%20a%20conservative%20financial%20policy.\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://dbrs.morningstar.com/research/463201/morningstar-dbrs-confirms-toyota-motor-corporation-at-aa-low-trend-remains-stable#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20Toyota%20benefits%20from%20its,and%20a%20conservative%20financial%20policy.\" target=\"_blank\">strong financial position</a>, the result of generations of conservative management, provides ample resources for future investment in cutting-edge technologies such as solid-state batteries and self-driving, as well as consistent dividend payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Two major risk factors to this investment thesis must be mentioned: The first is new and formidable competition from the Chinese auto industry, which increasingly demonstrates its mettle with Western consumers in foreign markets as well as China and could enter the U.S. at some future date, despite the current tariff roadblock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, Toyota faces the same risk as any automaker, that negative economic conditions will dampen demand for vehicles, thus undermining the growth of revenue and profit.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Toyota ADRs remain a buy in my judgment.</p>",

Chevron has delivered 37 consecutive years of dividend growth compared to Exxon Mobil's 26 years and Shell's 3 years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The investment strategy of both The Dividend Income Accelerator Portfolio and my private investment portfolio is based on a strategic balance between dividend income and dividend growth: while the first has a stronger focus on dividend income, the second prioritizes dividend growth. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What all the selected companies have in common is their capacity to provide investors with sustainable dividend income, which not only allows investors to constantly raise their dividend income but also to increase the probability of delivering strong investment outcomes when investing over the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is the case because over the long term, the companies' stock prices will follow the earnings results of the respective companies. This is the reason why the investment horizon of my portfolios is over the long term and why I suggest investing in companies that pay sustainable dividend income and that have significant competitive advantages.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Author's Note: Which high-yield dividend-paying companies are the core positions of your investment portfolio?</em></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
