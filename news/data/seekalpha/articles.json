To be clear, even though investors' reaction to tech juggernauts' earnings has been mixed for now, it is still complicated to construct a thesis for the immediate shift in the market's narrative, as the case for the interest rates going down is in place, and the AI narrative remains supportive of elevated valuations (even though they are looking increasingly worrisome to me, but as a value investor, I do have a certain bias).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this regard, I see no justification for switching from the growth &amp; quality factor combination (or just pure growth, for investors with higher tolerance to risk) to value &amp; quality.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, while AVLV does deserve investor attention, chiefly because of the high quality of its portfolio (I will be giving a lot of details on that below in the note), I see no potential in it to outperform the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVV\" title=\"iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF\">IVV</a>) in the short to medium term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Basics of The Avantis US Large Cap Value ETF</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Inception: September 21, 2021</li> <li>AUM: $8.397 billion, as of October 30</li> <li>Investment Advisor: American Century Investment Management, Inc.</li> <li>Expense Ratio: 0.15%</li> <li>3-Year Annualized Total Return (October 2022–September 2025): 19.7% vs. 16.71% of the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWD\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF\">IWD</a>) and 24.9% of IVV</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV Strategy: Active, Quality-, Value-Centered</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we know from the Avantis <a href=\"https://www.avantisinvestors.com/avantis-investments/avantis-us-large-cap-value-etf/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>, AVLV \"seeks long-term capital appreciation,\" is managed actively, and is benchmarked against the Russell 1000 Value Index. The latter fact is the reason why I will be comparing AVLV's factor mix to that of IWD (a mild spoiler as usual: AVLV is considerably stronger in nearly all aspects).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What companies does AVLV favor? As explained in the summary prospectus:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The fund seeks to achieve higher expected returns by selecting securities of companies with higher profitability and value characteristics, as well as smaller market capitalizations relative to others within the fund's large cap investment universe.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are two key metrics (but there are others) that are considered when deciding whether a company is cheap enough and has appealing profitability:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The portfolio managers define “value characteristics” mainly as adjusted book/price ratio (though other price to fundamental ratios may be considered). The portfolio managers define “profitability” mainly as adjusted cash from operations to book value ratio (though other ratios may be considered).</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the stock selection process, other parameters are taken into account as well, including free float, liquidity, past performance, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Does AVLV's turnover match its active approach? I would say that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVLV/risk\">at 5%</a>, it clearly does not, indicating that the portfolio sees nearly no changes, at least during \"the most recent fiscal year\" as of the most recent summary prospectus (as of January 1, 2025).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just for context, IWD's turnover is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWD/risk\">3x higher</a> at 15%, and this is the fund tracking an index, not actively managed.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since its inception in September 2021, AVLV has delivered quite a robust performance, as it has beaten IWD and the Invesco S&amp;P 500® Pure Value ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RPV\" title=\"Invesco S&amp;P 500® Pure Value ETF\">RPV</a>), which I believe was secured by the quality ingredient of its strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_28be882b551aeea1c1c7a5605912ef9e.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_28be882b551aeea1c1c7a5605912ef9e.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_28be882b551aeea1c1c7a5605912ef9e.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_28be882b551aeea1c1c7a5605912ef9e.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_28be882b551aeea1c1c7a5605912ef9e.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_28be882b551aeea1c1c7a5605912ef9e.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_28be882b551aeea1c1c7a5605912ef9e.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_28be882b551aeea1c1c7a5605912ef9e.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_28be882b551aeea1c1c7a5605912ef9e.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

The reason here is that I believe the Capital Group Dividend Value ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CGDV\" title=\"Capital Group Dividend Value ETF\">CGDV</a>), perhaps one of the best value ETFs in the market, which I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4715090-cgdv-etf-high-quality-outperformer-deserves-rating-upgrade-buy\">upgraded</a> to a Buy in August 2024 (and I am still bullish on the name), should be added to the peer group. Here, it also makes sense to include the JPMorgan Active Value ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JAVA\" title=\"JPMorgan Active Value ETF\">JAVA</a>), which was incepted in October 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-17619380431661224_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"828\" data-height=\"419\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-17619380431661224_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ETFs comparison\" width=\"640\" height=\"324\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-17619380431661224_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-17619380431661224_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-17619380431661224_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-17619380431661224_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-17619380431661224_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-17619380431661224_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-17619380431661224_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49647006-17619380431661224_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IVV was selected as a benchmark by the author <span>(Created by the author using data from Portfolio Visualizer)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Here, CGDV is the champion, with the highest CAGR and the strongest risk-adjusted returns (the Sharpe and Sortino ratios), as well as the lowest downside capture ratio.</li> <li>AVLV has the third-largest CAGR and the fourth-largest Sharpe ratio.

Its capital efficiency indicators (for instance, Return on Assets) are meaningfully stronger than IWD's as well.</li> <li>Surprisingly, it even has advantages on the growth front, including a 16.32% WA forward EPS growth rate.</li> <li>Its allocations to stocks exhibiting strong momentum characteristics (a B- Quant Momentum grade or higher) and sporting an appealing EPS Revisions grade are both higher than those of IWD.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To conclude, AVLV offers a potent active value &amp; quality strategy, robust enough to beat a few actively and passively managed peers like JAVA and RPV. Regarding factors, it is stronger than IWD in every single aspect I assessed above (some investors might dislike it for higher weighted average beta coefficients though). However, it does have a few disadvantages, chief among them being its inability to beat IVV and CGDV, as well as a quite uncomfortable downside capture ratio. So I believe a Hold rating is the one I should maintain today.</p>",

Is that true? Has any decision been made on that</em>?\"DJT: \"<em>No, it's not true\"</em> </p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N58rWlntB-s&amp;t=12s\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer noopener\">Times News</a>, 31/10/2025</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It would seem, however, that markets are less convinced, especially with the increased US military presence in the Caribbean Ocean in recent weeks. As can be expected, developments such as these threaten global oil supply, which boosts pricing - as seen in today’s session.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The effectiveness of US sanctions on Russian crude exports now in question</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Used primarily as a bargaining tool to encourage Putin to return to the negotiating table regarding the Russia-Ukraine conflict, markets are seriously questioning the effectiveness of recent sanctions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While predictably, the Kremlin made comments shortly after the announcement to suggest that the domestic Russian oil industry would be unaffected by new American sanctions, markets are now taking these comments more seriously.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This goes double for Vladimir Putin, who went on record to say he would not be “<em>cowed</em>” by other nations into making concessions about Ukraine, while simultaneously boasting about the success of new nuclear technology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While it is understandable that Trump wants to target Russian fossil fuels, with the three largest companies by market cap in Russia, Lukoil (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LUKOY\" title=\"PJSC LUKOIL\">OTC:LUKOY</a>), Rosneft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RNFTF\" title=\"Public Joint Stock Company Rosneft Oil Company\">OTC:RNFTF</a>), and Gazprom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GZPFY\" title=\"Public Joint Stock Company Gazprom Neft\">OTCPK:GZPFY</a>), all being energy corporations, it will take more supply-side risk to secure higher pricing for WTI, which is on pace for its worst yearly performance since 2020.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As expected, the level of risk premium priced into WTI markets has reduced significantly this week, not only due to the above, but also because of the market’s inherent nature: sudden news events often cause the markets to overreact.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">OPEC+ agrees on modest December output increase</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earlier in your reading, you may recall that I mentioned a potential shift in the status quo for crude, with the latest news from OPEC+ being what I was referring to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a meeting due this coming Sunday, the group leans towards a modest increase in output throughout December of 137,000 barrels, meeting the same target as September and October.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, an increase in supply with demand unchanged is inherently oil price negative, but considering OPEC has opted for a modest increase in production three months consecutively, markets are beginning to read between the lines:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>OPEC+ is becoming increasingly comfortable with the global oil supply</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If nothing else, this begins to limit the downside potential of crude, with current supply levels unlikely to be hiked significantly going forward.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">WTI Crude (West Texas Intermediate): Technical Analysis 31/10/2025</h3> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">WTI (WTICOUSD): Daily (D1) chart

This reading came in above the projected 42.3. Despite the improvement, the index still came in below 50, which marks the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> 23rd consecutive month of contraction for regional business activity.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Background on Chicago PMI</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Chicago PMI assesses the business conditions and the economic health of the manufacturing sector in the Chicago region. A value above 50.0 indicates expanding manufacturing activity, while a value below 50.0 indicates contracting manufacturing activity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at its historical performance, the current level of 43.8 is lower than where the index stood at the start of 6 of the 7 recessions since its inception. This suggests that such weak readings have often preceded broader economic downturns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"3131\" data-height=\"2275\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chicago PMI\" width=\"1280\" height=\"930\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_634ea7af46ff2fe5a75e43eb0258695b.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>A Closer Look Since 2000</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Examining data since 2000, the index has undergone fluctuations, often aligning with broader economic cycles.

But based on historical metrics, it suggests that a correction is coming - even if we don't know the exact timing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This potential for a correction has me essentially \"not investing\" at this time, except where I can see very clear upsides based on low valuations, in safe companies that will withstand \"any\" downturn, and where I have a long-term conviction. Such companies obviously come in many different shapes. Some are REITs, some are companies such as utilities, and some might be pharma companies. In this article, a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4790770-veolia-your-2025-pick-for-waste-water-recycling\">follow-up to this particular piece</a> from about six months back, I am going to update my thesis on <span class=\"cf0\">Veolia </span><span class=\"cf0\">Environnement</span><span class=\"cf0\"> SA</span> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VEOEY\" title=\"Veolia Environnement SA\">OTCPK:VEOEY</a>, Euronext Paris: VIE). Veolia is what I would consider an \"environment\" company. That doesn't mean renewables, but instead things like recycling, wastewater, water, and the like. If you follow my work, you know that I love these sorts of companies for the combination of regulatory safety, growth potential, and the fundamental characteristics they offer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this article, I will update my thesis on the company, which, I believe, is far more attractive than last time I covered it, using the Q2 '25/Half-year results, and a forecast for Q3 '25, which are set to be released in less than 4 weeks (currently <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VEOEY/earnings\">estimated</a> for November 6th).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's see what we have here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Veolia: Upside Is Here, Fundamentals Are Solid, Growth Is likely - I See Few Downsides</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Veolia is one of those companies where I honestly see very few long-term, short-term, or medium-term downsides.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why is that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A combination of factors. Let's go through them, with examples for each.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First off, fundamentals. The company is simply very appealing. BBB credit means the company is IG-rated, and despite this, it has a close to 5% yield, which, for a French multi-utility with these sorts of basics, is very solid. The company has been able to grow EPS in double digits since COVID-19, and current forecasts consider it likely for this growth to continue. While at times volatile, as history suggests, the past few years have seen the company really consolidate around its core strengths, providing potential growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This potential growth and potential can be seen in things <a href=\"https://www.veolia.com/en/our-media/newsroom/press-releases/veolia-and-suez-announce-they-have-reached-agreement-allowing#:~:text=the%20implementation%20of%20Veolia's%20plan,identified%20by%20Veolia%20will%20remain.\" rel=\"nofollow\">like the Suez M&amp;A</a>, expected by me and other analysts to be very value-accretive to the companies in the near term. This is despite the price paid, which, according to some, was too high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm also not the only one to consider 2025-2027E results to be very conservative - this is one of those companies where I expect significantly better results than even the market does.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even if the company's target markets were to slow down, the company has ample room for operational efficiencies, as evidenced by both the financial and management. But perhaps most importantly, Veolia has removed much of its cyclical exposure over the past two decades - another advantage. Furthermore, due to the relatively high inflation rate we've been having, cost savings rates have been seeing a higher retention rate - and the economic slowdown in Europe is turning around a bit, resulting in some upside for the company here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1375\" data-height=\"711\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Veolia Investor Presentation 1H25 IR\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619150031694157_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Veolia Investor Presentation 1H25 IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2Q25/1H25 results were solid and do not, to my mind, reflect the current valuation of the company.

Three of the basic building blocks of our modern society. If they also had electricity generation to any significant degree and managed to make it work within the business model, it would be almost ridiculously solid. But the company, instead, is focusing on \"boosters,\" which are specialized forms of its current operations, like Bioenergy, Hazardous waste, and Water tech. Veolia is one of the most significant players in hazardous waste in certain geographies, and the company's significant push into the Middle East is one of the core reasons I remain so positive about the company here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1393\" data-height=\"725\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Veolia Investor Presentation 1H25 IR\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"333\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619152918794572_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Veolia Investor Presentation 1H25 IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's synergy improvements over time have delivered over €150M worth of gains, with €482M post-Suez synergy gains, which is entirely in line with the year-end 2025E target of €530M.

Well, aside from political risks in France, where much of the legacy operations are located, there is very little operational risk at the very least. And the more the company actually moves outside of its legacy geography and becomes international, the more resilient it's likely to be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Veolia has not been assigned a premium by the market since late 2021. Since then, and the crash back in mid-2021/2022, it's been discounted at various rates. Today it trades below 13.2x, which, given what the company does, is fairly interesting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am much more positive about the company than I was even just a year ago. I consider it to have a moat, which it did not have in 2023-2024 (stabilization of municipal legacy water operations, following the fallout of municipal water cancellations and annulments in -15). The renewal rates for Veolia's contracts in France are also above 90%, highlighting just how entrenched this company is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that any valuation that puts this company below 13-14x P/E severely underestimates this company's potential - and that's with no growth, as opposed to the growth that's being forecasted here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For Q3 '25, I expect the company to continue alongside the performance to deliver an EPS growth of about 5% this year, with a growing EPS growth into 2026 and 2027E. I expect an EPS moving from €2.13/share this year to well over €2.6/share in 2 years. Even on the basis of just a conservative valuation, this would imply a significant upside here. The reason the company is likely to outperform in both Q3 '25 and 2025 is continued cost synergies, savings, and new contracts. I believe a combination of new business coupled with significant growth in key segments, like Hazardous waste, will deliver the 6-8% growth in earnings in 2026 and 2027, alongside better savings. For my assumptions, I use about a 6% WACC in my calculations, which I believe to be fair for this business.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation For Veolia: Upside Intact, More Than 15% Annualized, Is Easy To See</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At less than 13.2x P/E, the company is what I would consider undervalued. We have not reached the bottom we saw in 2024, but I'm not sure we're going down that far.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The upside, even just to a 15x P/E, is almost 20% per year here, making it a very solid investment choice.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619168074602249_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1698\" data-height=\"1471\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619168074602249_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FAST graphs Veolia Upside\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"554\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619168074602249_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619168074602249_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619168074602249_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619168074602249_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619168074602249_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619168074602249_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619168074602249_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49836612-17619168074602249_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FAST graphs Veolia Upside</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And I don't forecast at 15x P/E. As I said in previous articles, my estimate for the fair value of Veolia is above 18-19x P/E, which implies a fair value level of €50/share. And even that is not very exuberant - because the company's 20-year average suggests a P/E of over 22x, implying a fair value of over €65/share. I'm not going that high - I'm \"happy\" at 18-19x. My €50/share fair value suggests that you can buy this company in 2027 below €42/share, and this year at about €37/share or below. That was part of the rationale for my €36.5 PT, which I at this time also retain from my previous article.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over time, I fully expect my investment here to generate well over a 70-80% RoR, even though this will likely take time. I expect the company's CapEx to \"peak out\" at about €3.8B per year until 2029 or so, and this excludes the buyout of minorities in one of the company's operations back in June of this year, in line with guidance. Taking this into consideration also doesn't change my thesis in a significant way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The only reason that's holding me back from going even higher with my expectations here is the fact that the company's regulated municipal operations, as the name suggests, regulators will prevent Veolia from earning returns in excess of expectations. Much of the company's earnings still come from regulated businesses. This is not a bad thing. But in my view, it puts a cap on what's possible for Veolia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I view Veolia as a \"BUY\" with a €36.5/share PT here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alternatives I would consider in the same sector would be only one - American Water Works (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AWK\" title=\"American Water Works Company, Inc.\">AWK</a>) (and that one isn't even that close in operations to this one, beyond water). However, AWK is tricky here because at a conservative valuation, the company doesn't offer my hurdle in the same way that Veolia does.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For that reason, I consider Veolia to be the \"choice cut\" in this sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks are as follows.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks &amp; Considerations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks to the company are primarily related to French municipal trends and regulations. The events in -09 highlight the political risks in France, when annulment of contracts until 2015 in the water space was announced - and it's not impossible that such an event may happen again (though given current trends, I do consider it on the unlikely side).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aside from this, it's all about the impact of savings, how much savings and efficiency can bring to the table, next to the company's other improvements. There's an open question here, but I would point to what the company has been able to do previously.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aside from that, I do not see any noteworthy risks to the company, and therefore consider the company a Buy with the following thesis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Veolia is a great business in several great fields, and this upside has materialized since the full results for 2025 H1. They have some excellent moats, a solid history, and good future prospects. The Suez M&amp;A only strengthened the company's next few years, and whatever downsides exist and uncertainties are there, I believe they're outweighed by the upside potential in this stock, further enhanced by more savings and efficiencies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are downsides and risks, but these, at this valuation of below 14x, are relatively small. A company such as this, with these sorts of operations, at this sort of price, is precisely the sort of investment you may want to make - at least it's the sort of investment that I, personally, want to go \"deeper\" in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This upside can even go up to 15-35% if we allow for a premium valuation or even higher, historically accurate EPS growth (which I am open to), valuing the company at 18-19x P/E. My official PT is €36.5/share for October/November 2025, and I'm at a Buy at this time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (<em>italicized</em>).</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em>This company is overall qualitative.</em></li> <li><em>This company is fundamentally safe/conservative &amp; well-run.</em></li> <li><em>This company pays a well-covered dividend.</em></li> <li>This company is currently cheap.</li> <li><em>This company has a realistic upside based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion.</em></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company fulfills 3 out of 3 quality indicators, and 1 out of 2 valuation indicators. That means 4/5 \"stars\" here, which is enough for an attractive thesis for the company. Based on this, and a valuation target of €36.5/share where I see a risk/reward-adjusted upside that's attractive enough for me. I give the company a Buy rating as of October/November 2025.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a></span>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4809136-i-bought-amazon-as-im-ultra-bullish-on-its-margin-heavy-era-underway\">analysis</a>, the stock has gained 16% in price, a price return that has been particularly bolstered by strong <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511707-amazon-gaap-eps-of-1_95-beats-by-0_39-revenue-of-180_2b-beats-by-2_44b\">Q3 earnings</a>. In my prior analysis I analyzed<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the company's margin optimization, including operational efficiencies and Q2 earnings. My analysis was focused more on macro financials and sentiment considerations amid broad-based operational analysis. In this assessment, I'm delving into the company's autonomous strategy, a topic widely circulating in the press right now.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Preface: Q3</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before we begin on exploring the macro autonomy case for Amazon, the company just posted Q3 earnings, so I'll get you up to speed on that quickly here. If you're not interested in short-term earnings, feel free to skip to the next section below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/AMZN-Q3-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">In Q3</a>, net sales were up by +13% year-over-year, and service revenue significantly outpaced product revenue in growth (+16% versus +9.6%), with services offering a structurally more profitable mix. While the company's operating income was flat year-over-year, two charges hit which were non-recurring ($2.5B related to an FTC legal settlement, and ~$1.8B of severance). Without those charges, operating margin would have been ~12% versus ~11% a year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/AMZN-Q3-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">AI/data-center build-out</a> is still consuming cash at a remarkable rate. As of Q3, Amazon's TTM operating cash flow was $130.7B (up 16% year-over-year), but free cash flow fell to $14.8B because TTM purchases of PP&amp;E were $115.9B.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The headline <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/AMZN-Q3-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q4 guide</a> was for net sales of between +10% and +13% year-over-year, with modestly higher margins into peak season.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, it was a strong quarter, marked by real structural investment trends that are outweighed by profitability-focused growth and long-term moat effects being established. All of this is well understood by the market, which is why shares rallied 14% post-release.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon Is Structurally Aligned With America's Growth Imperative</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We've already established in my last analysis that Amazon's next alpha phase is operating-leverage led. Any fears about Amazon's automation horizon appear misguided to me, given that there is no logical reality whereby the U.S. does not compete for macroeconomic leadership through bolstered capital market growth. This can only be achieved through the reduction in federal debt-to-GDP by boosting GDP growth. Though it may be decades before work becomes \"optional,\" the workforce will likely trend away from human labor toward oversight of autonomous systems in the next 10 years (this is common sense, if you see the current trends in AI adoption, growth, and automated workflows already permeating).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That means that at first, Amazon's workforce will probably slow in growth, but eventually, yes, I see no reason why the workforce will not be \"cut.\" This might see pushback from regulatory agencies, but those agencies would illogically be working against the macroeconomic health of free world nations by stunting GDP growth by reducing the capital efficiencies of low-cost-to-serve autonomous behemoths, like Amazon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, autonomy reduces hires per unit of volume, which reduces exposure to wage inflation and peak-season hiring spikes. Amazon's filings actually still show increasing <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000086/amzn-20250630.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">logistics costs</a>, but they are being partially offset by <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000004/amzn-20241231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">network efficiencies</a>, so labor minutes per unit are falling without excessive job cuts. This reflects a staggered approach to efficiency optimization as AI capabilities ramp up and before any speculative government-backed UBI supports demand even amid lower employment rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even in the short term, the notion of UBI may not be as critical as we assume if pricing reduces and demand increases as forms of \"optional\" labor dominate the macro free market; i.e., the notion of \"socialism amid autonomy\" could be defunct. Right now, as automation makes the same-/<a href=\"https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/2024-amazon-sustainability-report.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">next-day network</a> more efficient and reduces the cost to serve <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-2023-letter-to-shareholders\" rel=\"noopener\">per unit</a>, small but persistent price cuts will transfer to the shopper (including time). That smooths volatility in discretionary spending and raises baseline demand, particularly in repeatable, low-ASP categories where shipping fees previously made financial returns look weak.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margins Rise As Prices Fall And Shares Keep Compounding</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We're really looking at two effects here on the company's financial positioning; the first is expanded gross margin, and the second is reduced prices for consumers. The second-order effect should be gradually increasing demand, allowing for the company to be considered a \"growth stock\" for decades to come if executed properly. This is rare—usually companies at maturity, like Amazon, transform into stalwarts and focus on operational efficiencies moderately to maintain average capital appreciation amid a saturated market. Amazon is in a unique position where it can incrementally improve margins and slash product and shipping prices to create an EPS-revenue growth flywheel; it looks like this:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Gross margin expansion raises EPS <strong>–&gt;</strong> lower prices and delivery friction lift revenue volume <strong>–&gt;</strong> volume growth compounds operating leverage <strong>–&gt;</strong> EPS growth over revenue growth while revenue growth stays resilient <strong>–&gt;</strong> reinvestment sustains the flywheel for decades. </em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is the primary reason why investing in Amazon right now is wise. You're investing in a growth flywheel that is optimized for durability amid the disruption from autonomous technology. Sentiment for the stock is elevated, but deservedly so. The monthly-intervals price chart shows the stock heavily above the 50-month MA, but this is typical for Amazon across the past 15 years. You get what you pay for, and Amazon, by all means of fundamental assessment, offers a fair valuation with resilient market-leading growth strengthened by a resilient moat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1633\" data-height=\"1316\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMZN One-Month-Intervals Price Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"516\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58583751-17619435344922426_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AMZN One-Month-Intervals Price Chart <span>(Author's Chart)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's forward PEG non-GAAP ratio is only about 10% higher than the sector, which reflects a moderate premium but indicates that the market is probably correctly bullish on the fact that consensus growth estimates are a little too low.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1206\" data-height=\"425\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon Consensus EPS Revisions\" width=\"640\" height=\"226\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617702627055721_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Amazon Consensus EPS Revisions <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I consider it important at this juncture to consider an allocation in Amazon based on future growth optionality that is implicit in the current macro trends. That is, as automated machinery and intelligent software scale, Amazon is a key beneficiary across both its physical and digital infrastructure stack. This vertically integrated model bolsters the likelihood that Amazon will outperform the analyst consensus. However, we also should recognize that Amazon has never significantly outperformed the consensus price targets in the past five years, meaning that achieving a 20%+ stock price CAGR over the long term is less likely than if Amazon stock was undervalued by Wall Street (it's not).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1300\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMZN Price Targets Historical\" width=\"640\" height=\"222\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/58583751-17617766017254055_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Labor Optics, Deflation, And Macro Elasticity</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, even slower hiring per unit of volume can be portrayed politically as job destruction; the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/amazon-takes-challenge-nlrbs-structure-us-appeals-court-2024-09-27/\" rel=\"nofollow\">NLRB</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/amazon-sues-wash-labor-agency-over-warehouse-safety-fines-2022-10-04/\" rel=\"noopener\">state labor boards</a> have already scrutinized Amazon's warehouse practices, and a rapid pivot to robotics could reignite union and legislative pressure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking further out, Amazon can't indefinitely offset macro softness through price cuts without eroding unit economics, so if discretionary income compresses in phases, Amazon's earnings power could also face volatility. This is why I believe management will be much more focused on macroeconomic analysis in the decade ahead to time price decreases (and increases) amid changing socioeconomics due to smaller big enterprise workforces softening demand in cycles unless prices correspondingly collapse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My above thesis also assumes rising affordability and optional labor sustain demand, but if political systems fail to backfill displaced income or if consumer psychology shifts toward savings, volume expansion could undershoot expectations. Also, in the bear case, systematic price deflation from automation could suppress nominal revenue growth even as EPS rises—to put it another way, staging or tempering the fundamental implications of autonomy may equate to a beast too difficult to tame.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Buy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm bullish on Amazon, but I think expectations need to be tempered. This is not a 3x the market stock; it's 2x the market at a push, and more like 50% greater returns than the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>) in the base case. That's still a decent return, but it isn't the 30–50% annual return one would seek if scrutinizing the market for the highest growth compounders.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, Amazon has a place in portfolios as ballast, aka defensive growth, which sounds contradictory given management's aggressive autonomy stance. However, the company is simply too saturated in its market for technological mechanics to make this an elite pick in terms of absolute returns. Amazon stock is elite in resiliency, and was once elite for its stock price returns, but now, the company has morphed into a mechanism for growth-portfolio security.</p>",

This includes products like vacuum trucks, sweepers, road markers, dump trucks, etc. The remainder of sales is largely comprised of safety and security products, in itself consisting of signaling and warning systems, among others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Publicly funded clients make up half of sales, with the remainder largely coming from industrial clients, notably oil and gas, utility, and other clients. One final comment about the business: Long having been somewhat of a stagnant business, the company and its performance really came to life over the past decade, certainly in more recent years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">About Those Valuations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After posting an impressive 20% revenue growth in 2023, with growth largely driven by organic sales, momentum continued last year, albeit in a slightly smaller fashion. Revenues rose by a more modest 8% to $1.86 billion, although the backlog actually was down 3% on the year before at $1 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, adjusted earnings rose by 29% to $3.34 per share, as the company clearly was seeing strong margin gains given the percentage differential in growth. Moreover, momentum was only set to continue in 2025, in part aided by a $78 million deal to acquire the owner of Hog Technologies. The company initially guided for sales to advance to $2.02-$2.10 billion, with earnings seen moving up further towards $3.60-$3.90 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trading around the $100 mark in the spring, shares were not necessarily very cheap given the outlook, but a blowout quarter arrived in July when second-quarter sales were reported up 15%. Even better, the backlog rose to $1.08 billion following a very strong order intake, with full-year sales seen around $2.10 billion and earnings seen at a midpoint of $4 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management furthermore raised its long-term margin targets, as all this and a leverage ratio of just 0.5 times made investors upbeat. However, based on this momentum seen already, earnings around $4 per share made that share trade at a low thirty times earnings multiples already. Hence, momentum in the shares did not automatically create a compelling risk-reward, in my view.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some Reality Kicks In</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After shares traded around the $130 mark recently, shares have sold off about 10% to $115 per share in the wake of the release of the third quarter results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In September, Federal Signal <a href=\"https://www.federalsignal.com/fs-news/federal-signal-to-acquire-new-way-trucks-expand-specialty-vehicle-platform-into-refuse-collection-vehicles\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.federalsignal.com/fs-news/federal-signal-to-acquire-new-way-trucks-expand-specialty-vehicle-platform-into-refuse-collection-vehicles\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> the purchase of Scranton Manufacturing Company, a US-based designer and manufacturer of refuse collection vehicles. The purchase price of $396 million furthermore excludes a $30 million transaction sum for the real estate of the property and a potential earn-out of $54 million, based on the performance in the coming two years. On the flip side, the net present value of tax benefits is pegged at $60 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Factoring in these tax benefits, the company claims an 11 times current EBITDA multiple being paid, suggesting that Scranton will add some $30 million in synergies. That multiple is seen dropping to 7 times by 2028, suggesting a $48 million EBITDA contribution that year, driven by realization of synergies. This matches the $15-$20 million synergy estimate provided, which by 2028 should boost earnings by $0.40-$0.45 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third-quarter sales <a href=\"https://www.federalsignal.com/fs-news/federal-signal-reports-third-quarter-results-including-17-net-sales-growth-and-24-operating-income-improvement-raises-full-year-outlook-october-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.federalsignal.com/fs-news/federal-signal-reports-third-quarter-results-including-17-net-sales-growth-and-24-operating-income-improvement-raises-full-year-outlook-october-2025\" target=\"_blank\">rose</a> by 17% to $555 million, with organic growth reported at a solid 11%. However, orders rose by just 10% to $467 million, pushing the backlog down to just below the billion mark, being somewhat of a worrying factor. Full-year sales are now seen around $2.12 billion, with adjusted earnings seen at a midpoint of $4.13 per share, but the softer orders likely make investors cautious.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net debt was down to $159 million, but this will jump to $585 million pro forma for the Scranton deal (ex earnout). That's no worry with adjusted EBITDA trending around $450 million here if we annualize the third quarter performance, for a leverage ratio just over 1 times.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Now?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In between the summer and today, we have seen some share price stagnation and, on a net basis, a slightly lower share price. By now, a low thirty times earnings multiple has come down to 27–28 times, while the company will see a small impetus from higher earnings and M&amp;A, the latter looking just fine according to the playbook of Federal Signal here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, appeal is on the increase, but that does not necessarily make that appeal surfacing just yet, as orders have been a bit soft, with the backlog being pretty stable in dollar terms. However, in relation to sales, the backlog is shrinking quite a bit in terms of how many months of backlog are seen in relation to revenues.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That and higher expectations likely set the stock up for a potential disappointment, and despite the correction, I'm still erring a bit cautious here. For appeal to be found, I'm looking to get involved at levels around the $100 mark, as my admiration of Federal Signal has only grown over time.</p>",

The fund’s <a href=\"https://www.bny.com/investments/us/en/individual/products/etf/fund/bny-mellon-global-infrastructure-income-etf.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a> states:</p> <blockquote><p>The fund<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> seeks long-term total return, and also targets, but does not guarantee, an annualized gross forward-looking 12-month yield of 6% or more for its portfolio.</span></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A 6% yield is a bit below the 7% that we prefer to target here at Energy Profits in Dividends, but it is still more than most midstream corporations deliver. For example, consider the following midstream energy corporations:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Company Name</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Current Yield</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>The Williams Companies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMB\" title=\"The Williams Companies, Inc.\">WMB</a>)</p></td> <td><p>3.47%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Pembina Pipeline (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PBA\" title=\"Pembina Pipeline Corporation\">PBA</a>)</p></td> <td><p>5.40%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Kinder Morgan (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KMI\" title=\"Kinder Morgan, Inc.\">KMI</a>)</p></td> <td><p>4.49%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Targa Resources (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TRGP\" title=\"Targa Resources Corp.\">TRGP</a>)</p></td> <td><p>2.64%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>DT Midstream (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DTM\" title=\"DT Midstream, Inc.\">DTM</a>)</p></td> <td><p>2.99%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Antero Midstream (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AM\" title=\"Antero Midstream Corporation\">AM</a>)</p></td> <td><p>5.15%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Enbridge (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENB\" title=\"Enbridge Inc.\">ENB</a>)</p></td> <td><p>5.75%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>ONEOK (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OKE\" title=\"ONEOK, Inc.\">OKE</a>)</p></td> <td><p>6.18%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the exception of ONEOK, which has seen its share price beaten down considerably since the start of this year, none of these companies managed to deliver a yield in excess of 6% and none of them managed to beat our targeted 7% yield. There are still some master limited partnerships that can deliver a 7% or higher yield, but the overall strength of the market and the strong performance of many midstream corporations over the past few years have made it very difficult to even manage to achieve a 6% yield. Thus, BKGI’s targeted yield looks fairly attractive in the current market environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, the fund does not appear to be hitting its 6% yield target. As of September 30, 2025, the fund’s website claims that it has an annualized yield of 5.39%:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368292349267.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Dividend Yield From BKGI Website\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"406\" height=\"229\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368292349267.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368292349267.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368292349267.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368292349267.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368292349267.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368292349267.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368292349267.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368292349267.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>BNY Mellon</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, if we look at the distributions that the fund has paid out over the past twelve months, we see this:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Ex Date</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Record Date</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Payable Date</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Amount</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>10/01/2025</p></td> <td><p>10/01/2025</p></td> <td><p>10/06/2025</p></td> <td><p>$0.3019</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>07/01/2025</p></td> <td><p>07/01/2025</p></td> <td><p>07/07/2025</p></td> <td><p>$0.4769</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>04/01/2025</p></td> <td><p>04/01/2025</p></td> <td><p>04/04/2025</p></td> <td><p>$0.0659</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>12/27/2024</p></td> <td><p>12/27/2024</p></td> <td><p>01/02/2025</p></td> <td><p>$0.4129</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This fund pays a quarterly distribution, so the above four distributions are the only ones that it has paid out in the past year. The total of these four numbers is $1.2576 per share, which is a 4.26% yield at the current share price of $39.50 each.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am not sure how the fund’s management is calculating the 5.39% distribution yield that it is advertising on its website. The largest distribution that the fund paid out over the past twelve months was $0.4769 per share, which annualizes to $1.9076 per share. That would only be a 4.83% yield at the current share price. Thus, I cannot see any supporting evidence for the fund’s claim on the website. Based on the distributions that this fund has paid out over the past year, the yield appears to be somewhere between 4% and 5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is still decent, especially given that the richly valued market has made it increasingly difficult to find anything with a respectable yield, but given that various sources seem to differ on what this fund’s yield actually is, we should keep the above discussion in mind and not get too excited when a source shows it to have a remarkably high yield.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">About The BNY Mellon Global Infrastructure ETF</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The website for the BNY Mellon Global Infrastructure Income ETF states that it has the primary objective of providing its investors with a high level of long-term total return, which makes sense considering that this fund invests in common equities. The fund’s <a href=\"https://www.bny.com/investments/us/en/individual/products/ebook.CUSIP09661T826.Prospectus.html?pid=09661T826&amp;file=/content/dam/im/documents/compliancedocs/prospectus/annual/4865_prs.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">prospectus</a> makes this quite clear, as it states:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The fund normally invests at least 80% of its net assets in securities issued by dividend-paying infrastructure companies.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund seems to take something of a broad approach with its definition of an infrastructure company. Most investors in other infrastructure funds expect that it will include things such as midstream energy, both electric and natural gas utilities, and things such as railroads and toll roads. Basically, these are companies that are largely taken for granted and frequently ignored by market analysts, but at the same time modern life would not actually be possible without them. BKGI includes those traditional infrastructure companies, but it also states that it includes things like communications services, health care, and real estate. It can be somewhat difficult to understand how such companies can be considered infrastructure firms, although a good case could be made for a telecommunications company that owns networks of fiber optic cables, considering how critical the Internet has become for modern life.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is also not too difficult to make a case for a company such as American Tower (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMT\" title=\"American Tower Corporation\">AMT</a>), which is a real estate investment trust that owns cellular phone towers, since smartphones and other mobile devices that can access the Internet have also become fairly critical for modern life. However, it is somewhat difficult to make the case for a healthcare company to be included in an infrastructure fund.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, the BNY Mellon Global Infrastructure Income ETF currently appears to be focusing much more on traditional infrastructure plays than on these ancillary segments that the fund’s management seems to think are infrastructure companies. As we can see here, more than half of the fund is currently invested in utility companies, and another 20.21% is invested in energy infrastructure:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936829608389_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1235\" data-height=\"543\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936829608389_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BKGI Asset Allocation\" width=\"640\" height=\"281\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936829608389_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936829608389_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936829608389_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936829608389_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936829608389_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936829608389_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936829608389_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936829608389_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>BNY Mellon</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, this puts the fund’s allocation to utilities and midstream energy at 76.89%, which when combined with the allocations to industrial infrastructure (such as railroads) and the 6.68% weighting towards telecommunications, has this looking very much like the traditional infrastructure funds that we are largely familiar with.

It has made a few return of capital distributions, which were probably funded by the fund receiving income from energy partnerships, but otherwise it appears to be investing in dividend-paying infrastructure companies and then distributing the dividends that it receives from these companies to its own investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the defining characteristics of infrastructure companies is that they tend to have higher distribution yields than most other things in the market. This comes from the fact that the infrastructure sector is a very capital-intensive one, and companies in this industry need to spend a considerable amount of money on infrastructure in order to maintain the assets that they have and construct new ones. Furthermore, infrastructure assets only have a finite capacity, so companies must construct new infrastructure if they wish to grow or expand. This limits the growth of most infrastructure companies when compared to something like a software company that only needs to duplicate a series of ones and zeros whenever a customer makes a purchase. Due to this limited growth, two other things are frequently true about infrastructure companies:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>They have lower earnings multiples than more rapidly growing companies. This tends to result in much more attractive valuations than other sectors.</span> <span>The companies pay out a reasonably large proportion of their cash flows to their investors as dividends in order to provide an investment return in the absence of strong capital gains.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>These two factors result in many midstream companies having considerably higher dividend yields than many other things in the market. We can see evidence of this simply by looking at the current yields of the largest holdings in BKGI’s portfolio. This table provides that information:</span></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Company Name</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>% of Total Assets</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Current Dividend Yield</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Enel SpA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENLAY\" title=\"Enel SpA\">OTCPK:ENLAY</a>)</p></td> <td><p>8.96%</p></td> <td><p>5.15%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Enbridge</p></td> <td><p>8.51%</p></td> <td><p>5.75%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Fortum Oyj (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FOJCF\" title=\"Fortum Oyj\">OTCPK:FOJCF</a>)</p></td> <td><p>8.32%</p></td> <td><p>4.53%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Dominion Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/D\" title=\"Dominion Energy, Inc.\">D</a>)</p></td> <td><p>6.35%</p></td> <td><p>4.49%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Omega Healthcare Investors (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OHI\" title=\"Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc.\">OHI</a>)</p></td> <td><p>5.60%</p></td> <td><p>6.72%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Orange (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORANY\" title=\"Orange S.A.\">OTC:ORANY</a>)</p></td> <td><p>5.29%</p></td> <td><p>5.42%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Engie SA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENGIY\" title=\"Engie SA\">OTCPK:ENGIY</a>)</p></td> <td><p>4.74%</p></td> <td><p>7.14%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Italgas S.p.A.

All of these companies have yields that are substantially higher than the 1.07% yield of the SPDR® S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR® S&amp;P 500® ETF\">SPY</a>), which is a popular way for investors to try and match the performance of the S&amp;P 500 Index in their own portfolios. The current yields of many of these companies also add some support to the fund website’s statement that BKGI is trying to achieve an overall distribution yield of 6%; after all, many of the companies shown above have yields that come very close to that level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The BNY Mellon Global Infrastructure Income ETF is an actively managed fund, whereas many of the other exchange-traded infrastructure funds in the market are passively managed. For example, the iShares Global Infrastructure ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IGF\" title=\"iShares Global Infrastructure ETF\">IGF</a>) simply tracks the S&amp;P Global Infrastructure Index. This is the same index that is also tracked by the SPDR S&amp;P Global Infrastructure ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GII\" title=\"SPDR® S&amp;P® Global Infrastructure ETF\">GII</a>), which explains why both of those funds have nearly identical performance over the past ten years:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368257148783_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1199\" data-height=\"417\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368257148783_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IGF vs GII 10-Yr.

This could be important due to the fact that a significant portion of the total returns of infrastructure companies comes from the dividends that these companies pay out. They are somewhat like fixed-income securities in this respect. As such, we could expect the higher-yielding BKGI to outperform IGF and GII when measured on a total return basis over time. This has, in fact, been the case over the past three years, as BKGI has delivered a 79.38% total return, which has beaten both of the two global infrastructure exchange-traded index funds:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368263205752_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1194\" data-height=\"418\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368263205752_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BKGI vs Indices 3-Yr.

However, this has been a remarkable performance for an infrastructure fund since inception, as it has not only managed to beat both of the index funds, but it even came somewhat close to matching the 84.10% total return of the S&amp;P 500 Total Return Index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500TR\" class=\"ticker-link\">SP500TR</a>). As infrastructure companies have underperformed the S&amp;P 500 Index for most of the past fifteen years, this has been a rather impressive performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the name of the fund suggests, the BNY Mellon Global Infrastructure Income ETF is a global fund that invests in infrastructure companies that are located in the United States as well as other countries. A look at the largest positions currently held in this fund would have left someone with a similar impression, as the fund does have a number of foreign names among its largest positions. However, it actually has more American exposure than might be thought, as the fund currently has 42.51% of its assets invested in American companies:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368269357836_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1223\" data-height=\"539\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368269357836_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BKGI Country Allocation\" width=\"640\" height=\"282\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368269357836_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368269357836_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368269357836_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368269357836_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368269357836_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368269357836_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368269357836_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368269357836_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>BNY Mellon</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This actually represents a slight overweight to the United States when compared to the S&amp;P Global Infrastructure Index (the index has a 40.93% weighting to the United States). However, apart from the United States being the largest country weighting in both BKGI and the index, the two are very different as far as their composition. Take a look at this comparison chart:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Country</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Weight in BKGI</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Weight in S&amp;P Global Infrastructure Index</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>United States</p></td> <td><p>42.51%</p></td> <td><p>40.93%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>France</p></td> <td><p>19.49%</p></td> <td><p>6.00%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Italy</p></td> <td><p>12.18%</p></td> <td><p>2.89%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Finland</p></td> <td><p>7.00%</p></td> <td><p>n/a</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>United Kingdom</p></td> <td><p>6.66%</p></td> <td><p>2.27%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Canada</p></td> <td><p>4.70%</p></td> <td><p>7.81%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>China</p></td> <td><p>1.65%</p></td> <td><p>4.61%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Spain</p></td> <td><p>1.27%</p></td> <td><p>8.78%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Belgium</p></td> <td><p>1.20%</p></td> <td><p>n/a</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can immediately see that BKGI’s country weightings are vastly different from those of the index. Furthermore, the fund is more concentrated in only a few names than is the index, which is not really surprising for an actively managed fund. The second largest country weighting in the index is Australia, which at 8.87% is lower than all three of the top countries by weighting in the fund’s portfolio. It is quite likely that the fund has its weightings set up in this way in order to increase the yields that it earns from its assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is also possible that the fund’s management expects Europe to outperform Australia overall, which has been the case over the past year.

We can see that here:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936828296708_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"872\" data-height=\"459\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936828296708_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"US CPI YoY Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"337\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936828296708_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936828296708_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936828296708_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936828296708_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936828296708_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936828296708_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936828296708_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-1761936828296708_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Trading Economics</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This chart shows the year-over-year rate of increase in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. In both September and October 2025, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates even though the most recent inflation figures showed worse inflation than in the prior month. Furthermore, the central bank also cut interest rates back in November and December 2024, even though the most recent inflation data during both of those months was also coming in worse than during the previous months. If the central bank is willing to cut in such an environment, it suggests that it is no longer determined to get inflation down and investors should adjust their portfolios accordingly. This suggests that they should favor equities issued by companies that have a high degree of pricing power or have some other form of protection that allows them to raise prices in an inflationary environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Infrastructure companies, in general, do have such protection. For example, we already saw that over half of BKGI’s portfolio is invested in utilities. The majority of utilities enjoy monopoly status and provide a product that most people consider to be a necessity, which would give them a lot of pricing power in isolation. This is the reason why they are regulated fairly heavily by governments, as politicians do not want them to exploit that monopoly status in order to extract “excessive profits” from their customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Government regulators quite frequently limit or control the prices that utilities can charge. These same regulators do, however, want utilities to be profitable as it creates other problems if they are unprofitable or if they are unable to provide their owners with a reasonable return. Thus, these regulators ordinarily will allow a utility company to raise its prices alongside inflation. Midstream energy companies also inherently have some protection against inflation, as the contracts that they have with their customers include clauses that result in their revenues rising with inflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another advantage that infrastructure stocks have during periods of high inflation is that their very high yields result in them having shorter durations than stocks issued by non-dividend-paying companies. In short, the cash flows provided by the stocks will allow the investor to recoup their initial investment more rapidly than would be the case with a company that won’t pay a dividend for years (or decades) into the future. All else being equal, the more rapidly the investor can get their money back, the less time that inflation has to compound against them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Admittedly, some readers may point out that the capital gains from low-yielding high-growth stocks can also provide a return that allows the investor to recoup their initial investment, it is necessary to sell the stock in order to actually spend those capital gains. Short-duration assets are historically the way to go when inflation gets bad, and this overall provides a case for holding infrastructure stocks or other short-duration assets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">BKGI Expense Ratio</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The BNY Mellon Global Infrastructure Income ETF has an expense ratio of 0.65%, but the fund sponsor has been reimbursing some of these expenses:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368289121249.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BKGI Expense Ratios\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"564\" height=\"346\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368289121249.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368289121249.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368289121249.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368289121249.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368289121249.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368289121249.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368289121249.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/695520-17619368289121249.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>BNY Mellon</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to the fund’s website:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>BNY Mellon ETF Investment Adviser, LLC has contractually agreed, until at least February 28, 2026, to assume the direct expenses at the fund so that the fund’s total annual operating expenses do not exceed 0.55% of the fund’s average daily net assets.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, until the end of next February, the fund’s expense ratio will remain at 0.55%. It is possible that the expenses will increase after that date if the contractual agreement is not renewed.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In conclusion, the BNY Mellon Global Infrastructure Income ETF is an interesting actively managed exchange-traded fund that aims to provide a higher yield and higher total return than the comparable index ETFs that have been available on the market for a long time. Historically, it has done pretty well at this, as it has beaten the S&amp;P Global Infrastructure Index since its inception.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the fund’s documentation claims to be attempting to get a 6% yield, and it is not currently paying that much. It is, however, paying a higher yield than the infrastructure indices, and when combined with its outperformance against them, could make it a pretty decent holding for anyone who is looking to generate income today.</p>",

This profile helps explain its performance in the past, as its sensitivity to interest-rate changes is moderate relative to an ETF like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TLT\" title=\"iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF\">TLT</a>), but meaningful to behave differently than short-duration vehicles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When GOVT was launched, yields were close to record lows as a result of the central bank's quantitative easing that followed the GFC. That's the reason that since inception and up to around 2018, the performance is insignificant; yields rose slowly from very low levels, so income power remained weak while rising rates acted as a driver of modest downward pressure on the fund's price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fast forward to 2020, when the Fed lowered the Fed Funds rate to practically 0% in order to bring stability to the markets and the economy; GOVT rose sharply due to the steep decline in yields.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After inflation rose to high levels in the following years, the Fed intervened again by aggressively raising the policy rate of interest. This was also steep enough for GOVT's price to tank in 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last, GOVT started recovering in late 2023 as it became clearer that inflation was falling towards the Fed's target and the central bank's rate hiking cycle was over.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_198b97c75bca1a1b7322b624db238160.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_198b97c75bca1a1b7322b624db238160.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_198b97c75bca1a1b7322b624db238160.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_198b97c75bca1a1b7322b624db238160.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_198b97c75bca1a1b7322b624db238160.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_198b97c75bca1a1b7322b624db238160.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_198b97c75bca1a1b7322b624db238160.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_198b97c75bca1a1b7322b624db238160.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_198b97c75bca1a1b7322b624db238160.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2025, GOVT kept climbing higher in a consistent manner.

With CPI at 3%, meaningfully above the 2% target, the monetary policy path is tricky to forecast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_42f43313ed7375b3491997a024ccf7bd.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_42f43313ed7375b3491997a024ccf7bd.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_42f43313ed7375b3491997a024ccf7bd.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_42f43313ed7375b3491997a024ccf7bd.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_42f43313ed7375b3491997a024ccf7bd.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_42f43313ed7375b3491997a024ccf7bd.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_42f43313ed7375b3491997a024ccf7bd.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_42f43313ed7375b3491997a024ccf7bd.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_42f43313ed7375b3491997a024ccf7bd.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Compared with short-duration vehicles, however, GOVT appears to be more attractive as well. Along with a higher risk of inflation, the labor market is also at risk of becoming a serious issue due to its softening in 2025 so far. That biases the Fed towards cutting further, even though the timing is highly uncertain. In such a scenario, GOVT should outperform both short and long duration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_37c60258cb20fb1170b38d69435fd30e.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_37c60258cb20fb1170b38d69435fd30e.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_37c60258cb20fb1170b38d69435fd30e.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_37c60258cb20fb1170b38d69435fd30e.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_37c60258cb20fb1170b38d69435fd30e.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_37c60258cb20fb1170b38d69435fd30e.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_37c60258cb20fb1170b38d69435fd30e.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_37c60258cb20fb1170b38d69435fd30e.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_37c60258cb20fb1170b38d69435fd30e.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth is another tailwind for Treasuries. In the first half of 2025, GDP has grown by ~1.4% on an annualized basis as a result of a contraction in the first quarter and a recovery in the second. Tariffs must have played a role in that below-historical-average level of economic growth, on top of restrictive monetary policy over the last 3 years. Economic forecasters expect the trend to continue for some time. Although a recession is not the base case, the risk of one occurring is elevated, and along with soft growth, investors are likely to continue being defensive to a meaningful degree, favoring safe havens like Treasuries over equities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c0b63898f689e018f4d85d215920076c.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c0b63898f689e018f4d85d215920076c.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c0b63898f689e018f4d85d215920076c.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c0b63898f689e018f4d85d215920076c.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c0b63898f689e018f4d85d215920076c.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c0b63898f689e018f4d85d215920076c.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c0b63898f689e018f4d85d215920076c.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c0b63898f689e018f4d85d215920076c.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c0b63898f689e018f4d85d215920076c.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are, however, two main risks worth monitoring. The first is the scenario where inflation rises more dramatically in the near term than it has in the past 12 months. And second, fiscal policy implies that the budget deficit will remain wide; with the Fed not in QE mode, the issuance of intermediate-term Treasuries implies supply that the central bank will not be able to absorb, and this will apply upward pressure on yields.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is not a time for a cash bias anymore, as rates are expected to come down faster now, and long duration offered by TLT offers a very early bet as the road will still be bumpy with inflation risk, as mentioned above. GOVT provides the sweet spot for fixed-income allocators.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, I am always open to challenging my views because being an ideologue in investing and trading can prove expensive.

Of the $574.9 million total, $409.4 million was spent. Now, 2024 was a record fire year, and 2025 was a milder season, and the total outlay averages to $205 million. The new contract averages to $224 million, given the ceiling of $1.1 billion over five years. I think the revenue from this contract will likely be lower than the ceiling amount. And it seems to me that the value of the contract lies in exclusivity that locks in Perimeter as the sole supplier and adds strength to its monopoly moat. It also provides flexibility to the USFS to expand prevention operations and provides the company a stable source of revenue over the next five years. The visibility is nice, but I prefer a conservative approach to re-rating this as a case for multiple expansion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Rising Founder Fees And Dilution Risk</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1449\" data-height=\"504\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Founder Advisory Fees\" width=\"640\" height=\"223\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-1761892149007027_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Founder Advisory Fees <span>(Perimeter Solutions 2024 10-K)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on the <a href=\"https://ir.perimeter-solutions.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001880319-25-000021/prm-20241231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">disclosure</a> about the founder’s agreement, the fixed fee is 2.3 million shares per year, continuing through 2027.

If I fill out the remaining trading days for the year at an average of $25, the projected average closing price would be $16.52. To follow the maths in the disclosure, we need to subtract the high watermark established when the variable fee was last made in 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Increase ($2.89) = 2025 Average Price ($16.52) – Previous high watermark ($13.63).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The total variable fee in 2025 would be 18% of this increase multiplied by 157.1 million shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fee per share = $2.89 x 18% = $0.5202.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Total potential 2025 variable fee = $0.5202 x 157,137,410 shares = $81,742,921.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Half of the distribution is required to be in stock, with the balance payable in cash or stock at the founders’ discretion. On its current market cap, the amount in its entirety represents a 2.6% dilution. I’d say this would still be fine, but the average closing price in 2025 was dragged down by lower levels earlier in the year. Let’s say the price on average is around $25 in 2026. In that scenario, the variable fee would climb to $239.8 million, or a 7.7% dilution on the current market cap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Potential 2026 variable fee = (25 – 16.52) x 18% x 157,137,410 = $239,854,543.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you consider the 4.65% dilution from the fixed fee (2025 – 2027), this nets to a 15% dilution without a potential variable fee in 2027 and a 0% return on the stock in 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Valuation &amp; Final Take</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-17618923423749127.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Sum of the parts valuation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"636\" height=\"253\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-17618923423749127.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-17618923423749127.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-17618923423749127.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-17618923423749127.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-17618923423749127.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-17618923423749127.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-17618923423749127.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48014573-17618923423749127.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Sum of the parts valuation <span>(Tunga Capital)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The valuation assumptions in my previous thesis turned out to be pretty conservative. The YTD adjusted EBITDA is already $295 million, whereas I had assumed about $312 million for the next twelve months. If you apply the YTD 20% growth rate to the final quarter, the run rate annualizes to $334 million. I have assumed about a 9% increase over that number for the next twelve months ($365 million). It’s based on the idea that even in a moderate fire year, the margin expansion from an all-powder footprint should offset the impact from the ongoing situation at the Sauget plant.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the absence of dilution, I’d likely still maintain a Strong Buy rating and wait for more data in future earnings. But the dilution effects really tamp down the upside. A re-rating now depends more on some of the other catalysts, such as solid-state batteries, coming into play. I am therefore maintaining a hold rating for now.</p>",

It's seeing my dividends come in\". What probably gives me even more pleasure is seeing my dividends come in from a variety of businesses around<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the world, operating in different countries, and paying me in different currencies. Good and solid dividend growth, in my view, is one of the better ways of building investment income that is protected from inflation, because even if the dollar weakens, these companies selling all over the world will convert their profits into whatever the market rate is to provide a growing level of purchasing power of all the things they are selling. For those who do not get as much pleasure from looking around the world for dividends, there are of course ETFs that make it easier than ever to buy a simple and cost effective package of these foreign dividend stocks, and collect their yields from a single ticker. The ETF I wanted to pick up and have a refreshed review of today is the Vanguard International High Dividend Yield Index ETF (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VYMI\" title=\"Vanguard International High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF Shares\">VYMI</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4609020-vigi-vs-vymi-dividend-etf-better-buy\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4609020-vigi-vs-vymi-dividend-etf-better-buy\" target=\"_blank\">last reviewed VYMI in June 2023</a>, when I compared it against Vanguard's other international dividend ETF that focuses more on dividend growth than high yield, the Vanguard International Dividend Appreciation ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VIGI\" title=\"Vanguard International Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF Shares\">VIGI</a>). At that time, my conclusion was that I preferred VYMI over VIGI because of VYMI's significantly higher yield (=significantly deeper value tilt, and I believe in value), while still having enough of a screen on dividend growth.

That is because, in my view, these dividend focused ETFs are not \"pure\" to the original Vanguard idea of simply buying the total market at the lowest possible cost, as opposed to paying up for a dividend screened portfolio.

In conclusion, I will then explain who I think this ETF is for, and which type of account I believe it is best held in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">VYMI's Current Portfolio</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vanguard ETFs publish their holdings only quarterly, so these observations are based on what I see on <a href=\"https://advisors.vanguard.com/investments/products/vymi/vanguard-international-high-dividend-yield-etf#overview\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://advisors.vanguard.com/investments/products/vymi/vanguard-international-high-dividend-yield-etf#overview\" target=\"_blank\">VYMI's homepage</a> dated September 30, 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Geographically, VYMI is quite diversified with about 14% in Japan, 11% in the UK, 8% in Canada, 7% in Switzerland, and 7% in Australia, among the top 5 developed markets. Mainland Chinese stocks make up a little over 6% of VYMI, though Taiwan and Hong Kong respectively make up about another 4% and 2%, which adds up to an overall exposure of 12% to \"Greater China\", which also sounds about right. There are also +1% allocations to other interesting markets like India, Mexico, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and Korea, so while I might want to see more of a tilt towards these more minor markets, at least some exposure is there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of sector exposure, the one big standout is that over 42% of VYMI is in financials. This may not be surprising given that in many foreign markets, financials are the largest, and in some cases, only dividend paying stock available in that market, and effectively act like a leveraged exposure to that country's credit market. While I would love to see international dividend ETFs separate financials and non-financials so I can do my own mix, for now, this is what we have. The next four largest sector weightings in VYMI are energy, industrials, consumer discretionary and consumer staples at about 7-8% each, so starting to look quite well balanced once we get past the financials.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of this writing, the single largest reported holding is British-based and Hong Kong focused bank HSBC Holdings Plc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSBC\" title=\"HSBC Holdings plc\">HSBC</a>), which <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4133070-hsbc-still-more-of-a-hong-kong-than-a-global-or-u-k-bank\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4133070-hsbc-still-more-of-a-hong-kong-than-a-global-or-u-k-bank\" target=\"_blank\">I first covered in 2017</a>, and still hold some shares in today in a few client accounts. The next three holdings are Switzerland's top 3 giants Novartis (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVS\" title=\"Novartis AG\">NVS</a>), Roche (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RHHBY\" title=\"Roche Holding AG\" target=\"_blank\">OTCQX:RHHBY</a>), and Nestle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NSRGY\" title=\"Nestlé S.A.\" target=\"_blank\">OTCPK:NSRGY</a>), so even the #3 and #4 holdings in this ETF trade OTC on the US market, which is one reason many US investors might prefer them packaged in an ETF. Rounding out the top 10 are names most readers will be very familiar with: Shell, Toyota, Mitsubishi, RBC, CBA, and Allianz.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">VYMI's Dividend: Past and Future</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VYMI's reported dividend yield was 4.28% as of September 30, and would likely be about the same today as VYMI is up less than 1% over the month of October. That's only about 0.2% per year higher than the 10-year US Treasury yield (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y\" class=\"ticker-link\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y\" target=\"_blank\">US10Y</a>), so besides tax reasons (mentioned at the conclusion), the main reason to prefer VYMI over bonds is if you expect these dividends will not only not get cut, but will likely increase in the future. Below is the sum of dividends paid each calendar year since the fund's launch in 2016, showing an overall solid growth trend, even with plenty of fluctuation from year to year, much of which is due to currency fluctuations. Given the percentage of the portfolio invested in businesses that are likely to increase their dividends with inflation, I overall see this as a better long-term income portfolio than the 10-year treasury for many portfolios. </p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td>Year</td> <td>Sum of Dividend</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2016</td> <td>1.356</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2017</td> <td>2.1484</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2018</td> <td>2.4154</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2019</td> <td>2.6807</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2020</td> <td>1.9585</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2021</td> <td>2.8868</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2022</td> <td>2.8024</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2023</td> <td>3.0473</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2024</td> <td>3.2859</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2025 (Q1-Q3)</td> <td>2.3766</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">VYMI versus other International Dividend ETFs</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VYMI is the largest non-US focused dividend ETF I am aware of at almost $13 billion in assets under management, over double that of the next largest with $6 billion, and the next three with about $2 billion each. Below is a quick YChart of these other four competing ETFs's relative assets under management, and rolling 5-year total returns, which I leave here with no further comment, as comparing these would deserve a whole different article. What I will mention here is that VYMI's expense ratio of only 0.17% is significantly lower than IDV's 0.49% and IHDG's 0.58%, but almost double the 0.09% charged by HDEF and DIVI. Of these two cheaper ETFs, HDEF focuses more on higher dividend yields, so its dividend yield is significantly higher than that of DIVI and closer to that of VYMI.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_37a897a98e378073cd760e0b1b5ef27d.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_37a897a98e378073cd760e0b1b5ef27d.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_37a897a98e378073cd760e0b1b5ef27d.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_37a897a98e378073cd760e0b1b5ef27d.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_37a897a98e378073cd760e0b1b5ef27d.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_37a897a98e378073cd760e0b1b5ef27d.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_37a897a98e378073cd760e0b1b5ef27d.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_37a897a98e378073cd760e0b1b5ef27d.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_37a897a98e378073cd760e0b1b5ef27d.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While VYMI is not the cheapest ETF focused on non-US high dividend stocks, it is the largest and overall has a solid portfolio, track record, and brand name. As with every ETF though, it's not for everyone, so I wanted to conclude by saying who it's for, where it's best to own it, and who it's not for.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VYMI could serve as a solid pillar in a portfolio primarily focused on generating dividend income, especially one that needs that dividend income to come from non-US sources to diversify away from US equity risk. In my view, it is ideally held in a US taxable account, as there it might be possible to claim foreign tax credits back from the foreign countries that withhold taxes on dividends paid out through this fund. I say <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4764677-beyond-vxus-3-reasons-to-use-single-country-etfs-instead\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4764677-beyond-vxus-3-reasons-to-use-single-country-etfs-instead\" target=\"_blank\">more about foreign tax credits in this article</a>, where I even say how to go even further with the idea for those who are really into maximizing foreign tax credits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So who is VYMI not for? First of all, I think this ETF may not be the best buy for many non-US investors, as the US may withhold taxes on VYMI distributions over and above those already withheld by the foreign companies when sending their dividends to this fund. Second, I'd rather hold VYMI in a taxable account, and hold US dividend stocks in an IRA or tax sheltered account, in order to maximize the tax credit benefit, as mentioned already. Finally, I would also say VYMI is not for investors who don't need the income and instead want to maximise total return, as opposed to just income return. There is a whole other argument about dividends and total return, but for now, I hope this review has been helpful for those just wanting to see how well VYMI does its job of letting you see your dividends come in from dozens of countries around the world.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
