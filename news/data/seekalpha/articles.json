(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTCH\" title=\"Match Group, Inc.\">MTCH</a></span>) portfolio is sufficiently diversified and dominant in the dating app industry to offset declining users across several of its apps. I believe the market is misunderstanding how popular Tinder<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> is, its global reach and its penetration of younger users. Despite several catalysts for Tinder, the market is still pricing in a 27% annual decline over the next five years. Hinge is the fastest-growing dating app, and Bumble Inc. (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BMBL\" title=\"Bumble Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">BMBL</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) is beating Tinder in this race to the bottom. Still, with a troubled feedback loop and high CEO turnover, I believe the mispricing is clear and rate this a Buy.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Introduction</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Match group owns well-known dating apps like Tinder, Hinge, Match.com, plus many others. The last time I counted, its Evergreen &amp; Emerging segment had around 30 dating apps. I recommend taking a look at the names of some of these platforms as some are very unexpected to say the least.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tinder's declining users have been <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865534-match-group-stock-tinder-bleeding-users-hinge-growth-slows\">concerning</a> investors for a while now with paying user declining 10% y/y and revenue declining for the first time to $1.86 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-1772033393394109_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1942\" data-height=\"612\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-1772033393394109_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Tinder KPIs\" width=\"640\" height=\"202\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-1772033393394109_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-1772033393394109_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-1772033393394109_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-1772033393394109_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>MTCH 10K </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even with 30+ Apps, 53% of revenue and 78% of OI come from Tinder. Hinge contributes about 20% of revenue and 16% of OI. So basically, Tinder and Hinge drive ~94% of Match Group's operating income. This says two things, first of all that its other two segments, E&amp;E and MG Asia, despite comprising 17% and 8% of revenue, their margins are low enough that they contribute very little to the bottom line. Second, it explains why the market is so sensitive to Tinder's decline, which I'll show more clearly later in the DCF. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720358313322456_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2129\" data-height=\"949\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720358313322456_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Hinge KPI's\" width=\"640\" height=\"285\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720358313322456_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720358313322456_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720358313322456_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720358313322456_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>MTCH 10K </span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720357431841855_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1474\" data-height=\"1309\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720357431841855_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"E&amp;E and MG Asia KPIs\" width=\"640\" height=\"568\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720357431841855_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720357431841855_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720357431841855_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/62626171-17720357431841855_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>MTCH 10K </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a levered FCF margin of 24% and an ROA of 17.67%, it is clear the business is efficient and generating cash. Match Groups has had negative book value for about five years, mainly due to aggressive buybacks. In 2025, about 117% of UFCF was returned through buybacks and dividends. its has reduced its diluted share count by 10% over the past two years. with a net leverage of 3x and an interest coverage ratio of 6x, the debt looks manageable for now. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fact of the matter is that Match group is the leader in the dating industry with <a href=\"https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tinder-statistics/\" rel=\"nofollow\">more than 50%</a> market share. Despite Tinder showing slowing growth and even negative growth this year, it is still the most popular dating app with around 25% market share. In fact Tinder, Hinge and Plenty of Fish are all owned by Match Group and <a href=\"https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tinder-statistics/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">together </a>have around 50% market share. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382672119322_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"910\" data-height=\"664\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382672119322_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Dating apps market share\" width=\"640\" height=\"467\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382672119322_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382672119322_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382672119322_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382672119322_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Business of Apps</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its profitability metrics tell a similar story with a gross margin of 72%, EBIT margin of 25%, net margin of 17.6% and a ROIC of 19%. These high margins and profitability metrics allows Match Group to be more resilient to top-line pressure. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Through my research, it became a recurring theme that Tinder is still the <a href=\"https://www.datingadvice.com/online-dating/most-downloaded-dating-apps-in-the-world\" rel=\"nofollow\">top</a> app and that declining payers and revenue are the only metrics that show Tinder is declining. Don’t get me wrong, payers and revenue from Tinder are the most important metrics to consider but what I am getting at is that the market is overestimating Tinder’s decline and its impact on Match group.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Something to be concerned about is the high CEO turnover since 2019. With four CEOs in eight years, none of them have been able to stop Tinder’s slowing growth and monetization. This is a high risk, as no CEO will be able to implement their vision in just two years. The main problem is that its shareholders have been very impatient with Tinder bleeding users. The new CEO, Spencer Rascoff has made significant changes to Match Group such as reducing its workforce by 13%, reducing management by 20%, centralizing tech and data among all its apps and generating $100 million in annual cost savings. All positive information, but Tinder payers and revenue continues to decline. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before I explain why I think the market may be overestimating the bleeding, I want to quickly comment on Tinder as a service and its problems. As part of this research, I interviewed many students at the University of Arizona. I will later explain other insights I got but a recurring theme is that Tinder is <a href=\"https://medium.com/@victoria-brooks/tinder-is-a-dumpster-fire-now-infested-with-ai-scammers-89c0ebd0787d\" rel=\"nofollow\">plagued with bots and fake accounts</a>. This, combined with the fact that Tinder has a <a href=\"https://mashable.com/roundup/best-hookup-apps\" rel=\"nofollow\">reputation </a>of being an app for hookups, creates a horrible app experience.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Opportunities</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even after being around for so many years, Tinder has still managed to appeal to the young generation with 35% of users being 18-24. It has the highest user penetration within the 18-24 and 25-34 age bracket. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62626171-17721181571774948_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1538\" data-height=\"958\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62626171-17721181571774948_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Tinder age penetration\" width=\"640\" height=\"399\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"399\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62626171-17721181571774948_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62626171-17721181571774948_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62626171-17721181571774948_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/62626171-17721181571774948_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Business of Apps</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I interviewed students, Tinder was the most popular dating app with Bumble being a close second. What surprised me the most was that among students who have never used a dating app, the first app they would consider was Tinder. I think there is a massive opportunity in the fact that the <a href=\"https://ssrs.com/insights/the-public-and-online-dating-in-2024/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">young generation</a> still use it even though it was launched when they were between 4-10 years old.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-1771638267620307_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1350\" data-height=\"781\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-1771638267620307_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Age market share\" width=\"640\" height=\"370\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-1771638267620307_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-1771638267620307_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-1771638267620307_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-1771638267620307_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SSRS</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this increasingly globalized world, it looks like Tinder is the first option for most countries when online dating and the hookup culture get adopted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382675882742_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"715\" data-height=\"479\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382675882742_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Top 3 dating apps among asian countries\" width=\"640\" height=\"429\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382675882742_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382675882742_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382675882742_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/62626171-17716382675882742_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GMCR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another opportunity I see is that Bumble is actually in a worse situation than Tinder. Bumble’s paying users decreased 16% in Q3 2025 compared to an 8% decline for Tinder. Dating apps don't release user data only payer data but from the fact that Bumble has the same market share in the US at around 25%, and Tinder has double the amount of paying users at 8.8 million which means that Tinder is better at converting users into paying users. With this race to the bottom, although negative for Match Group's largest app, in general Hinge will benefit. I think this is the advantage that Match Group has, with such a diverse portfolio of apps, it is certain that Match Group will benefit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the biggest opportunity however is again what the market is pricing Tinder will be in the future which I projected.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My objective with this valuation was to determine what growth rates the market is pricing for Tinder and Hinge. To do this, I first of all assumed a WACC of 7%, which is an average of what I calculated and what I saw on different websites. I then broke down each of Match Groups segments and projected its RPP, Payer and operating income to project the revenue and operating income of each of the segments. I then made a DCF and incorporated the assumed projected revenue and operating income to arrive at a price. With conservative assumptions for the rest of the segments, I then calculated what Tinder's revenue growth will have to be to arrive at the current price of $30.

This is the main point of my thesis as it looks like the market has been chronically misunderstanding the slowing and now decreasing revenue from Tinder. Its diversified portfolio with the third largest dating app allows Match Group to be resistant to large declines in Tinder. With high adoption rates among emerging markets and among the youth populations it looks like it's very unlikely for Tinder to decrease so much in the next couple of years. In my view, that looks overly pessimistic. If I assume a more realistic 10% annual decline in Tinder paying users (instead of the market-implied path), my valuation increases to about $52 per share, implying ~73% upside. Now in the risk section I will try to point out the risk that the market may be also pricing in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the main problem with a business model like Tinder is that barely anyone pays for these apps. Out of the 50 students I interviewed, only two had paid for a dating app, Tinder, and only for a brief period of time. Both of them told me it worked too well and didn’t even have the time to respond to every match. Any dating app has to balance its effectiveness and its monetization as each has the opposite effect. In a couple of interviews, students told me that they met their couple on dating apps and even someone’s sister met her husband on Tinder but I doubt any of them paid for it. Tinder relies on the hook up culture to receive compensation for unlimited swipes, which, in turn, worsens the app for people not looking for that (which is a big portion). With an intense dependency on networking effects, this makes Tinder be in a negative feedback loop where Tinder depends on people looking for a different experience than the majority, causing users to leave.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the tumultuous CEO turnover it is hard for investors to understand the direction Match Group is taking and actually see changes. This combined with the fact that it has negative equity and a negative tangible book value of $2.7 billion makes it more risky. Leverage has only been increasing with $700 million added in 2025 while revenue stayed basically flat. In 2025, it returned to shareholders more than 100% of its FCF and management has committed to continue doing that. With cash growing, this suggests that debt may be helping fund aggressive capital returns (buybacks + dividends). This has me questioning the sustainability of its high share repurchase program and how responsibly management is using debt to support capital returns. With more than half of its total assets being goodwill and with many of its sectors declining in revenue, it is likely that an asset impairment will happen. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The way I see it is that the market is overestimating and overweighing Tinder’s declining revenue in a sector with intense networking effects. Despite the fact that paying for these services is a luxury barely anyone pays for, its international reach and popularity among the young generation is overlooked. The market could be pricing in a 27% decline every year or a 1% terminal decline and still Match Group’s portfolio will resist it. There have always been controversies with dating apps but I still believe that these will still be used and in an increasing amount of countries. Globalization <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/362170308_Hook-up_culture_among_young_Indian_adults_in_Indian_metropolitan_cities\" rel=\"nofollow\">has</a> made hookup culture expand to other countries such as India, Indonesia and Japan and this trend will only continue. Tinder is the first app in mind for online dating and intense networking effects will make it hard for this to change. I rate this a Buy,</p>",

Even though these fears feel validated given that there is a swath of SaaS companies trading at massive multiples while providing marginal value to end consumers, the market has certainly overreacted on this one name that possesses a deep moat, high operational efficiency, double-digit top line growth, and enough capital and investments to benefit from this compute revolution, and that name is Microsoft Corporation (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">YTD, Microsoft's stock has declined by more than 20%, while its mega-cap peers only declined by single-digits. This drawdown is underserved for a company that has dominated the software industry for decades, proving management's tenacity and drive to maintain the innovative streak that enabled the firm to survive multiple tech revolutions. This time is no different, and if anything, to me it looks like the AI revolution will likely benefit incumbents rather than startups, given the upfront capital required for training and inference. This overreaction is giving investors that seek quality names an opportunity to benefit from MSFT's upside as the market corrects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among the Mag 7 names, Microsoft was one of the names that underperformed the SPDR® S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>) and the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAGS\" title=\"Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF\">MAGS</a>) on a 1-year performance, losing 5% of its value while MAGS and the SPY returned 16.59% and 15.07%, respectively. The outperformance of these ETFs was largely influenced by the massive rally of Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>), which returned 72.33% YoY, outperforming both ETFs and its mega-cap peers. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719467901819174.png?io=w640\" alt=\"YoY performance\" width=\"636\" height=\"550\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"636\" data-height=\"550\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719467901819174.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719467901819174.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719467901819174.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">YoY performance <span>(YCharts)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My job as an analyst is not to just look at the firm's financial statements and do fundamental and comparable analysis to tell whether this could be a great investment or not; additionally, one should also do meta-analysis, meaning get a sense of how other market participants could be viewing the stock, because ultimately these are the people who deepen their wallets and hit the bid, resulting in a repricing. I have stated in my previous <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4866501-newmarkets-corporation-stock-i-see-ceiling-to-earnings-growth\">writings</a> that in 2026 we are seeing a sector rotation, where capital is fleeing tech and going to less fashionable sectors like energy and materials. The core reason for this behavior is that most investors are starting to be wary of the promises that most tech names made trying to justify tight and often negative profit margins while trading at high multiples. AI adoption has also magnified the worry. Instead, investors are now lowering the risk exposure by loading capital to high-margin names that look insulated from the AI disruption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The chart below shows the behavior difference between tech and the materials sector. For tech names, we are seeing EBITDA multiples trending down as EBITDA margins increase, highlighted by the slow decline in the green trend line, implying that investors would often pay more for low profitability as long as the multiples were justified by high topline growth. This is not the case in sectors like materials, where profitability actually matters, as it reflects the operational strength of the firm to return capital to its shareholders. This is highlighted by the slight upslope of the red trend line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719468681093853_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1276\" data-height=\"506\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719468681093853_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Technology vs Materials sector\" width=\"640\" height=\"254\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"254\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719468681093853_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719468681093853_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719468681093853_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719468681093853_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Technology vs Materials sector <span>(Analyst Chart, Stock Analysis)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Digging in more into software names, this trend is even clearer. This reflects a historical behavior where investors over-indexed for growth and under-indexed for profitability. The rationale was that once software companies get to operate at a massive scale, it's easy to expand margins due to consumer lock-in. These assumptions are now in question, and it looks like companies with low margins will continue to witness price drops in the coming quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Microsoft is insulated from this risk, in my opinion; it has one of the highest EBITDA margins in the sector but still trades below peers on EBITDA multiples (16.48 vs. the sector median of 17.51). The reason MSFT received a D- rating for valuation is due to its high price-to-sales multiple of 9.35 vs. the sector median of 3.12; this is not a preferred multiple to use for companies of Microsoft's scale.

This growth rate was driven by server and cloud services increasing by 31%, followed by M365 commercial and related cloud services increasing by 16%, and other services like gaming, Windows, and LinkedIn in aggregate increasing by 4%. Cost of revenue increased 19% to $25.98 billion, resulting in gross profits increasing 16% to $55.30 billion and landing margins at 68%, outperforming the sector margin, which is 48.85%. Operating expenses increased 5% to $17.02 billion, leading to operating income increasing 21% to $38.28 billion and landing EBIT margins at 59.36%, outperforming the sector margin, which is 6.62%. Pretax and net income increased 64% and 60% to $48.25 billion and $38.46 billion, respectively, bolstered by $9.97 billion from non-operating income, which landed EPS at $4.14 and an estimate beat by $0.22. Bear in mind that the firm now records capital gains from its investment, like in OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>), as miscellaneous income inflating pre-tax and net income. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719474649711225_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6000\" data-height=\"3000\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719474649711225_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q2 2026 Income Statement\" width=\"640\" height=\"320\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"320\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719474649711225_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719474649711225_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719474649711225_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719474649711225_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Q2 2026 Income Statement <span>(Analyst Chart, SEC Fillings)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q2 2026 Cash Flow Statement</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT/cash-flow-statement\">cash flow</a> also increased 60% to $35.76 billion, offset by a $9.63 billion cash outflow from working capital.

This is the section of Microsoft's financials most investors are concerned about. I don't share the same concerns. Yes, if the firm were to reallocate these spendings to share repurchases and dividend payouts, the stock would easily rerate higher, but this would then put the company in a vulnerable position to get disrupted by firms that are willing to deepen their pockets and grow dominance in the AI space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719475419788127_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6000\" data-height=\"4000\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719475419788127_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q2 2026 Cash Flow Statement\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"427\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719475419788127_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719475419788127_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719475419788127_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719475419788127_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Q2 2026 Cash Flow Statement <span>(Analyst Chart, SEC Fillings)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q2 2026 Balance Sheet</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And besides, it's not like Microsoft is using debt to build GPU chips and data centers; in fact, as illustrated by the state of its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a>, current debt decreased 8% to $4.8 billion, and long-term debt decreased 11% to $35.4 billion, while reserved cash increased 39% to $24.3 billion. The concerning item in Microsoft's assets is investments increasing 21% to $65.2 billion, making the current asset base more sensitive to mark-to-market repricing of these liquid assets the firm holds. If these assets are marked lower than the purchase price, we could see a decline in current assets. The same concern is true with long-term assets, as PP&amp;E accounts for $261.1 billion and grew by 56% YoY. A majority of these assets are GPU and CPU chips with changing depreciation schedules and could be made obsolete by newer and more advanced GPU releases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719490868786602_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6000\" data-height=\"4000\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719490868786602_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q2 2026 Balance Sheet\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"427\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719490868786602_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719490868786602_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719490868786602_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719490868786602_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Q2 2026 Balance Sheet <span>(Analyst Chart, SEC Fillings)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earlier in the article, I did point out charts that showed that Microsoft trades cheaply relative to its sector while returning more than average margins.

Given that depreciation schedules of GPUs and CPUs fluctuate drastically in response to newer releases. There's a small likelihood that these GPUs are losing value quickly, which will shorten the depreciation schedule, compressing margins, which would paint a dim picture of Microsoft fundamentals, impacting the valuation rerating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second risk has to do with the fact that 45% of Microsoft's backlog is sourced from OpenAI. Given the intensifying competition in the AI space coming from Google's Gemini and Anthropic, the chances of OpenAI losing its dominance and failing to deliver on Microsoft's obligations are increasing, and that could reduce Microsoft's future revenue expectation by $280 billion. One analyst pointed this risk out during the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4863620-microsoft-corporation-msft-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">Q2 2026 earnings call</a>, and management's response wasn't convincing to me, as it didn't lay out a coherent plan on how management is planning to reduce this exposure; instead, they just said the risk is lower relative to peers, which is not a good response.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719493506443791.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q2 2026 earnings transcript\" width=\"575\" height=\"412\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"575\" data-height=\"412\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719493506443791.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719493506443791.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/58361526-17719493506443791.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Q2 2026 earnings transcript <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Microsoft has experienced a massive selloff YTD due to the capital exodus that affected the broader tech and software sector; as a result, the firm now trades below its sector and mega peers on earnings multiple while continuing to grow top line by double digits and expanding margins at a consistent rate. This presents an appealing buying opportunity, as I estimate more capital will start flowing to high-margin companies as a risk to safety bet. I rate Microsoft a Buy.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><i>Editor's Note:</i></span><i> This article was submitted as part of Seeking Alpha's </i><i><a target=\"_blank\" url=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855433-new-article-competition-top-2026-long-idea\" href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855433-new-article-competition-top-2026-long-idea\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Top 2026 Long Idea investment competition</a></i><i>, which runs through February 28.

And looking back, we can state that my “Hold” ratings were probably correct, and so far, Adobe has not been a great investment. When one would have bought the stock at the point the articles were published, one would have lost money.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my last article, however, I wrote in the conclusion:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Although the stock was trading for cheaper prices in the past, this is the first time I would see Adobe as a cautious “Buy” instead of a “Hold” during my last articles. In the last three years, the fundamentals of Adobe improved, and therefore the stock is a “Buy” today, although it's trading for a slightly higher price than three years earlier when I rated the stock only as a \"Hold.\"</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This assessment and “Buy” rating was wrong – really wrong. Since my last article was published, Adobe has declined 40% and now the stock is trading more than 60% below its previous all-time high.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_c67cbb718fe23b6a6db7da61415a9d55.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_c67cbb718fe23b6a6db7da61415a9d55.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_c67cbb718fe23b6a6db7da61415a9d55.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_c67cbb718fe23b6a6db7da61415a9d55.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When looking back at the history of Adobe, we see several years of steep declines for the stock – and the current decline is not even the steepest. <span>T</span>he stock suffered several drawdowns of 50% or more. Nevertheless, the stock seems very cheap at this point. I already rated the stock as a “Buy” in my last article, and now – with the stock trading 40% lower again – we take another look and argue why Adobe seems like a bargain, in my opinion. Software companies are under attack, but Adobe is not only reporting still great metrics - it's also trading for very low valuation multiples. Hence, many risks - including less consistent growth rates over the years - should already be reflected in the stock price, making it difficult to be bearish.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Extremely Low Valuation Multiples</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We start by looking at the extremely low valuation multiples Adobe is trading for right now. Right now, Adobe is trading for 14.7 times earnings, which is already a low valuation multiple. We must go back to the years around 2010 to find similar low valuation multiples for Adobe, and it's clearly trading below the long-term average of 44.62.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_1e1421dc4bcdee774a73b6f35f6bf3c4.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_1e1421dc4bcdee774a73b6f35f6bf3c4.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_1e1421dc4bcdee774a73b6f35f6bf3c4.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_1e1421dc4bcdee774a73b6f35f6bf3c4.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When looking at the price free cash flow ratio, we get even more extreme numbers. At the time of writing, Adobe is trading for 10.8 times free cash flow, clearly below the long-term average of 27.56 and very close to the all-time low of 8.3. This is hinting towards an extreme bargain or a company that is clearly struggling to grow – to answer this question, we can start by looking at the last quarterly results.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Quarterly Results</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On Dec. 10, 2025, Adobe reported fourth quarter and full-year results for its fiscal year 2025. We start by looking at full-year results. Total revenue increased from $21,505 million in fiscal 2024 to $23,769 million in fiscal 2025 – resulting in 10.5% year-over-year growth. Operating income increased 29.1% year-over-year from $6,741 million in fiscal 2024 to $8,706 million in fiscal 2025. And finally, diluted net income per share increased from $12.36 in fiscal 2024 to $16.70 in fiscal 2025 – resulting in 35.1% year-over-year growth.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945716541336_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1384\" data-height=\"801\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945716541336_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Adobe is reporting full-year results for fiscal 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"370\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945716541336_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945716541336_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945716541336_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945716541336_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Adobe Q4/25 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Full-year results look pretty solid and don’t really match a P/FCF ratio close to 10. But full-year results might be misleading, and we also have to look at the last quarterly results to see whether growth rates are slowing down. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, total revenue increased from $5,606 million in Q4/24 to $6,194 million in Q4/25 – resulting in 10.5% year-over-year growth. Operating income increased 15.5% year-over-year from $1,957 million in the same quarter last year to $2,261 million in this quarter. And diluted net income per share increased from $3.79 in Q4/24 to $4.45 in Q4/25 – resulting in 17.4% year-over-year growth for the bottom line.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457175488305_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1384\" data-height=\"831\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457175488305_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Adobe's performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"384\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457175488305_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457175488305_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457175488305_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457175488305_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Adobe Q4/25 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the next step, we can look at the guidance for fiscal 2026.

GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in a range of $17.90 to $18.10 – resulting in 7.8% year-over-year growth.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945718487264_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1383\" data-height=\"818\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945718487264_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Adobe: Financial targets for fiscal 2026\" width=\"640\" height=\"379\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945718487264_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945718487264_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945718487264_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945718487264_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Adobe Q4/25 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Metrics Still Great</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far, it does not seem like Adobe is really struggling.

Of course, return on invested capital is fluctuating more than the company’s margins. Nevertheless, Adobe is reporting high return on invested capital on average – 24.6% in the last 10 years and 28.41% in the last five years. Additionally, we see RoIC accelerating in the recent past, which is also a good sign for the business.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457195196776_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"912\" data-height=\"508\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457195196776_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Adobe: Profitabililty and Efficiency\" width=\"640\" height=\"356\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457195196776_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457195196776_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457195196776_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457195196776_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Adobe: Profitabililty and Efficiency <span>(Author's work)</span></p></figcaption></figure> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Software Under Attack</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A new technology is usually generating winners and losers and leading to major shifts in the economy. Right now, it seems to be the consensus that the business model of many software companies is under immense pressure or that some businesses might even go bankrupt – otherwise many valuation multiples can’t be explained.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And at first, we have to assume that GenAI applications can perform many of the tasks Adobe’s products are used for, quite well. However, that statement might be too superficial, and we will try to break it down by looking at the three reporting segments of Adobe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The offerings bundled in the Publishing and Advertising segment might actually be at high risk. However, Adobe is generating only about $260 million in annual revenue from this segment, and it has already been declining in the past few years. Tasks like web application development or technical document publishing seem almost like perfect tasks for AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second segment is Digital Experiences, which is responsible for $5.86 billion in revenue in fiscal 2025 and is growing about 9% year-over-year. For the applications offered in this business segment, there's also the risk of GenAI taking market share. Tasks like measuring customer experiences and providing analytics and reporting for advertisers, agencies, or publishers can certainly be replaced by other GenAI applications. However, these systems are usually deeply embedded in the company’s structure, and aspects like multi-channel coordination (due to different stakeholders) are hard to replace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the company’s third segment, <em>Digital Media</em>, the situation is similar. In fiscal 2025, it was generating $17.65 billion in revenue – resulting in a growth rate of 11.3% year-over-year. This segment offers applications to create, publish, and promote content, and it seems like GenAI is excelling at these tasks. However, when considering aspects like brand consistency (which is important for huge corporations), professional storytelling, or the fact that usually several different stakeholders are involved, it becomes questionable whether Adobe’s products can actually be replaced by other GenAI applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my last article, I already wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Adobe can generate huge opportunities to hold and grow customers if it is able to offer AI applications that are integrated within other programs in a way that is advantageous to users, which they can’t get anywhere else. If Adobe can include AI features, the switching costs might be high enough that customers will stay with Adobe – especially if other alternatives are similarly expensive.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key for Adobe to defend itself against competitors is focusing on its core applications, which are hard to duplicate at this point and often deeply embedded in a company. The second and decisive step is to include GenAI functionality in its existing products. When Adobe is able to include these features, for which customers might switch to other products, into its products, it most likely can prevent the switching entirely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, we should not ignore the steep learning curve most Adobe applications have. It could take hundreds of hours (or maybe even years) before somebody is at an expert level, and it remains questionable whether companies are willing to give up this knowledge to save a few bucks. The alternative (some GenAI application) has to offer similar functionality for a lower price to get companies to switch, and even if these applications are often more intuitive, it seems unlikely that customers would be willing to sacrifice the experience employees have in established software.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, we also have to consider the possibility that we're all too optimistic at this point about AI and what it can do. One study called<a href=\"https://www.remotelabor.ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.remotelabor.ai/\" target=\"_blank\"> <em>Remote Labor Index: Measuring AI Automation of Remote Work</em></a> is painting a rather anticlimactic picture of GenAI and its abilities. Not only are all AI agents clearly below the human baseline when using an Elo score, but they're also able to achieve only a very small percentage of the tasks given.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945711449302_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1734\" data-height=\"1266\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945711449302_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Automation Rate and Elo score of different LLMs\" width=\"640\" height=\"467\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945711449302_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945711449302_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945711449302_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945711449302_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Remote Labor Index Paper</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, replacing humans and replacing other software applications are two different things. Nevertheless, the study is showing that we might be too optimistic about GenAI right now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks: Limited Upside, Less Consistency, and Improving AI Models</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest problem I see for Adobe (and some other software companies) is the limited upside and a declining consistency in its results. In the last decade (with most software companies switching to SaaS models), we saw high stability and consistency – especially for revenue growth. This was also part of the reason why software companies were trading for high valuation multiples, as investors usually reward predictability.<a href=\"https://www.idc.com/resource-center/blog/is-saas-dead-rethinking-the-future-of-software-in-the-age-of-ai/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.idc.com/resource-center/blog/is-saas-dead-rethinking-the-future-of-software-in-the-age-of-ai/\" target=\"_blank\"> It seems likely</a> that a per-user, per-month licensing model will become rather obsolete in the years to come, and new metrics like consumption, outcomes, or organizational capability will determine the revenue of software companies (for example, pricing per token). </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In such a scenario, revenue growth is still possible and also at similar rates, but we should expect the picture to be choppier – like it was before companies were switching to subscription models. And we should not expect growth rates to accelerate in any way, as software companies are rather in a defensive mode right now. However, limited upside potential for a company is not equivalent to declining revenue or even growth rates slowing down. Analysts are also remaining quite optimistic that Adobe will be able to grow in the high single digits or maybe even double digits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A final risk for Adobe (and my bullish thesis) in the years to come is an accelerating improvement of AI models. When looking at the <a href=\"https://epoch.ai/benchmarks\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://epoch.ai/benchmarks\" target=\"_blank\">Epoch Capabilities Index</a> for the different models, we still see them making progress and getting better, and the Frontier performance across different benchmarks is also showing improvements.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47657197-17721764141898081_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"908\" data-height=\"510\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47657197-17721764141898081_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Frontiert Performance Across Benchmarks\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47657197-17721764141898081_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47657197-17721764141898081_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47657197-17721764141898081_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/47657197-17721764141898081_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>EpochAI</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recently, in an interview, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSg5LInLdhM\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSg5LInLdhM\" target=\"_blank\">Judea Pearl was also pointing out</a> that the current transformer models we have used since 2017 and are still using (and which are responsible for the breakthroughs in the last nine years) can’t be scaled forever.

In the past few years, Adobe was mostly trading for high valuation multiples, making share buybacks rather ineffective. But with the stock trading for almost 10 times free cash flow, it can – and should use – its free cash flow on share buybacks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fiscal 2025, Adobe spent $11,756 million on share buybacks – more than the generated free cash flow and reduced the number of diluted shares outstanding from 443 million in Q4/24 to 417 million in Q4/25 – a decline of 5.9% year-over-year.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_9676803866412a40946cd35e06586176.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_9676803866412a40946cd35e06586176.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_9676803866412a40946cd35e06586176.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_9676803866412a40946cd35e06586176.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When using the free cash flow of the last four quarters ($9.7 billion), Adobe would be able to repurchase slightly above 9% of its shares outstanding, and this by itself would be enough to achieve analysts’ estimated growth rates for the years to come. Of course, this always depends on the stock price remaining at a low level, which seems unlikely if Adobe can continue to grow in the high single digits (or maybe even double digits).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Intrinsic Value Calculation</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the end, let’s calculate an intrinsic value for the stock to determine whether it is a good investment or not. As always, we're calculating with a discount rate of 10%, as this is the annual return we like to achieve at a minimum. Additionally, we calculate with 417 million diluted shares outstanding.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_cee0b5bb307fea4c374f9beb95fe78df.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_cee0b5bb307fea4c374f9beb95fe78df.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_cee0b5bb307fea4c374f9beb95fe78df.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/saupload_cee0b5bb307fea4c374f9beb95fe78df.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now we could calculate with the free cash flow of the last four quarters, which was $9,718 million. However, when looking at the free cash flow margin, 40.9% in the last four quarters seems to be rather high and might be a bit too optimistic. Instead, we can calculate with the average free cash flow margin since the IPO, which was 31.9%. When taking the revenue for fiscal 2025, we get a free cash flow of $7,582 million that we're taking as a basis. Now let’s also be very cautious about the growth rates we use and assume only 5% growth for Adobe in the years to come. This leads to an intrinsic value of $363.65 for the stock, and Adobe is already trading below its intrinsic value at this point.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457135284173_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"832\" data-height=\"724\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457135284173_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Adobe: Intrinsic Value Calculation\" width=\"640\" height=\"557\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457135284173_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457135284173_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457135284173_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-17719457135284173_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's work</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, we can calculate even with a more optimistic scenario. For free cash flow, we once again use the average free cash flow margin, but use the expected revenue for fiscal 2026. This leads to an expected free cash flow of $8,294 million, which we take as the basis for our calculation. Additionally, we can be a little more optimistic about growth rates in the years to come and calculate with 6% growth. Using these assumptions, we get an intrinsic value of $497.24, and Adobe would be deeply undervalued at this point. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945714884833_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"832\" data-height=\"732\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945714884833_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Adobe: Intrinsic Value Calculation\" width=\"640\" height=\"563\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945714884833_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945714884833_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945714884833_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/47657197-1771945714884833_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's work</span></p></figcaption></figure> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Insider Activity</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One final problem remains and that's something we should not ignore –<a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/adbe/insider-activity\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/adbe/insider-activity\" target=\"_blank\"> insider activity</a>.

If Adobe is really a bargain at this point and would also be perceived by management as a bargain, we should see some buying activity at this point.

However, aside from those two arguments, it's difficult to argue why Adobe should not be a “Buy” at this point. Looking at the metrics, the company is able to defend itself with high RoIC, increasing margins, and revenue still growing at a solid pace.

Santander is no exception and its P/BV multiple has increased significantly, from a bottom valuation of around 0.3-0.4x book value back in 2020 and just around 0.7x book value one year ago, to its current <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAN/valuation/metrics\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAN/valuation/metrics\" target=\"_blank\">level of 1.63x book value</a>.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Despite this strong re-rating of its shares over the last year, this was not supported by earnings growth, as Santander was pressured by lower rates in Europe over the past few quarters. Nevertheless, the impact was softer than feared some months ago, and earnings momentum has been positive in recent quarters supporting to some extent some re-rating of its shares.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Indeed, Santander has released at the beginning of February its <a href=\"https://www.santander.com/content/dam/santander-com/en/documentos/informacion-privilegiada/2026/02/hr-2026-02-03-2025-results-earnings-presentation-en.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.santander.com/content/dam/santander-com/en/documentos/informacion-privilegiada/2026/02/hr-2026-02-03-2025-results-earnings-presentation-en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">2025 earnings</a>, with both revenue and earnings being above market expectations. Its revenues amounted to €62.4 billion in 2025, being flat compared to the previous year, as net interest income (NII) was pressured by lower rates in Europe and currency effect also had a negative impact on revenues, while fees were stronger and were able to offset weakness in NII.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Santander is one of the European banks more geared to interest rates, both due to its high reliance of NII on overall revenues (NII accounted for 73% of revenues in 2025), but also due to its higher exposure than average to variable-rate loans. This profile is obviously negative during a period of declining rates, making Santander’s NII weakness not a surprise and explains why NII declined by 3% YoY during 2025.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>By business segment, this impacted mainly its retail banking segment, which is more exposed to loans, while other segments had a better performance and reported increasing revenues during last year. Specifically, payments were a bright area with revenues increasing to €6 billion, representing an increase of 17% YoY, driven by higher customer transaction activity, both related to credit cards and digital payments. The wealth segment also had a positive performance, a trend that was also visible for other peers, as rising capital markets and net inflows from customers boosted activity and fees during 2025.</span></p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226352423818_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"997\" data-height=\"448\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226352423818_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart of payments and wealth segments\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"288\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226352423818_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226352423818_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226352423818_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226352423818_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">KPIs <span>(Santander)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Given this background, it’s not surprising to see that Santander’s fees increased by 5% YoY, to €13.6 billion in 2025, reaching a recover level. Other revenues, including trading gains, were up by 33% to nearly €3.4 billion, being also an important factor to offset weaker NII on total revenues.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Regarding costs, the bank achieved good cost control and reported operating expenses of €25.7 billion in 2025, down by 1% from the previous year, being an important contributor for improved efficiency. Santander’s cost-to-income ratio, a key measure of efficiency in the banking sector, was 44% (including corporate centre costs), being a good level of efficiency compared to other global banks, that usually have efficiency ratios between 50-60%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>On the asset quality front, Santander’s cost of risk ratio was stable at around 115 basis points (bps) implying provisions for loan losses of €12.4 billion in 2025 (an increase of just €100 million compared to the previous year). This shows that credit quality has not changed much over the past few quarters, being positive earnings stability.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Considering that Santander’s revenues, costs, and provisions for loan losses were almost unchanged during the last year, it’s somewhat surprising to see that its bottom-line increased by 12% YoY to €14.1 billion. This was largely driven by ‘other results’ that amounted to <a href=\"https://www.santander.com/content/dam/santander-com/en/documentos/informe-financiero-anual/2025/ifa-2025-consolidated-annual-financial-report-en.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.santander.com/content/dam/santander-com/en/documentos/informe-financiero-anual/2025/ifa-2025-consolidated-annual-financial-report-en.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">negative €3.4 billion in 2025</a>, representing a decline of 30% YoY. These are related to impairment of assets, revaluations of financial assets, and other financial results that aren’t specifically related to the operating performance of the bank. This means Santander’s operating result was practically unchanged during 2025, with most of its earnings growth coming from less negative non-structural ‘other results’, that may not be recurring in future years.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>This shows that Santander’s underlying growth prospects aren’t particularly impressive, a profile that the street seems to agree with, considering that both revenue and earnings <a href=\"https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANCO-SANTANDER-S-A-69308/finances/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BANCO-SANTANDER-S-A-69308/finances/\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a> are expected to increase around low single-digits growth rates in 2026.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>However, despite this relatively weak organic growth profile, Santander’s financial figures are expected to be impacted by several M&amp;A operations that are pending, including the sale of its Polish unit and the acquisition of TSB Bank in England. Moreover, Santander has recently<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4546481-banco-santander-to-acquire-webster-financial-in-123b-cash-and-stock-deal\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4546481-banco-santander-to-acquire-webster-financial-in-123b-cash-and-stock-deal\" target=\"_blank\"> announced</a> the acquisition of Webster Financial (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBS\" title=\"Webster Financial Corporation\">WBS</a>) for some $12.3 billion in a cash-and-stock deal in the U.S., being the largest acquisition from a European bank in the country over the last two decades.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>As Santander was expected to have some excess capital when it completes the sale of the Polish unit, with only part of proceeds being recycled on TSB Bank, it has capacity to grow in other regions and has decided to expand its presence in the U.S.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>This acquisition was valued at about 2x tangible book value, which is not particularly cheap, as Santander seems to be buying at the top of the cycle. However, as Santander U.S. is a segment that is largely exposed to consumer finance, namely auto finance, this acquisition allows it to change its profile in the U.S. and become much more exposure to retail and commercial banking. Indeed, within the group, the U.S. operation had a different profile compared to other regions that are usually more exposed to retail and commercial banking, something that was somewhat odd as Santander has a conservative risk profile and auto finance is not particularly a core business in other regions.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Therefore, I see this acquisition as a positive step on a strategic point of view for its U.S. operation, leading to a lower risk profile and a more sustainable operation over the long term. This is also visible on some key financial indicators, such as the cost of risk that is expected to be reduced by some 30 bps for the combined bank and the loans-to-deposits that should decline from 109% to 100% following the consolidation of Webster.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Moreover, Santander expects to extract about €800 million of annual cost synergies from this acquisition, leading to improved profitability of the combined bank over the next few years and EPS accretion of 7-8% by 2028.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>With this acquisition Santander will have a much more balanced loan book profile in the U.S., being in my opinion one of the most attractive factors for this acquisition. As shown in the next graph, the combined entity will have less loan exposure to consumer finance and a higher to weight to commercial &amp; industrial (C&amp;I) loans, as Webster is largely exposed to C&amp;I and commercial real estate (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRE\" title=\"Cre8 Enterprise Limited\">CRE</a>) loans and has a much lower cost of risk ratio than Santander’s current U.S. operations.</span></p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226361793773.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart of combined loan book in the US\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"618\" height=\"512\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226361793773.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226361793773.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1104021-17722226361793773.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Loan book <span>(Santander)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Beyond announcing earnings and the acquisition of Webster, Santander has also performed an investor day recently, presenting new financial target and business outlook for the next three years. Its strategy is not expected to change much in the near future, aiming to grow its business through customer growth while cutting costs and improving efficiency at the same time, namely by using technology and AI.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Regarding its financial targets, Santander <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556634-santander-stock-up-after-bank-declares-targeting-over-20b-in-profit-by-2028\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556634-santander-stock-up-after-bank-declares-targeting-over-20b-in-profit-by-2028\" target=\"_blank\">aims to reach a net profit</a> above €20 billion by 2028 and a return on tangible equity (RoTE) ratio above 20% (vs. 16.3% in 2025), being somewhat aggressive targets in my opinion. Management seems confident that it can achieve business growth over the next three years and continue to improve efficiency to a level around 36% by 2028, being key for higher profitability ahead. As AI is rapidly improving and is making several tasks easily automated, I believe the bank can cut costs significantly over the coming years. Additionally, the consolidation of TSB and Webster should generate important revenue and cost synergies. This means Santander may be able to achieve its financial targets by 2028, but execution is key during this period and is something that investors should monitor closely over the next few quarters and years.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Regarding capital, Santander maintained its target of having a CET1 ratio of at least 13%, which seems acceptable considering the bank’s business profile largely geared to retail and commercial banking. As the bank’s capital ratio is close to its target, the bank has plenty of room to return capital to shareholders ahead, but Santander didn’t change its distribution policy much for the coming years. It expects to return around 50% of annual earnings to shareholders, with about 35% being through dividends and 15% through share buybacks. This seems to be conservative, and Santander could have been more aggressive in my opinion, as there is not much need to retain capital over the next few years.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Banco Santander’s operating performance during 2025 was not fantastic, with revenues and operating profits practically unchanged from the previous year, while the bottom line benefited from lower losses on less relevant financial figures. Despite that, its valuation measured by the P/BV multiple more than doubled during the last year to the highest level over the last decade, as investors have pushed bank stocks to all-time highs in recent months. While Santander is taking good steps to improve its business profile, such as the acquisition of Webster, and its financial targets for 2028 show confidence on business growth and profitability ahead, I think Santander’s current premium valuation is high and makes its risk-reward proposition not much attractive for long-term investors.</span></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

It's not a bad case or one without potential, but we're talking about a Target that is no longer a “deep value,” where you were paid in dividends to wait for the turnaround to happen.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Target's Last Quarter Was Just Ok</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I saw that TGT stock was rising, I looked at the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4523724-target-non-gaap-eps-of-178-beats-by-007-revenue-of-253b-in-line-updates-fy-outlook\">Q3 earnings</a> (which came out a few months ago); I expected more. I thought the market had seen some transition point, and while that may be the case (I'll explain why in the next section), the financials themselves are a little disappointing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sales continued to fall, by about 1.5%, and I expected comp sales to be “less bad.” Note in the chart below that Q3 comp sales were worse than Q2, with Q3 declining by almost 3%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-1772224136439982_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1487\" data-height=\"698\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-1772224136439982_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Target Comp Sales\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-1772224136439982_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-1772224136439982_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-1772224136439982_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-1772224136439982_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Target IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think there was a reasonable explanation: the spending on discretionary items is still poor, but at least Target managed to grow in other segments such as beverages and toys. Macroeconomically speaking, it makes sense that the average American continues to spend at Walmart and Costco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COST\" title=\"Costco Wholesale Corporation\">COST</a>), and with higher inflation, it becomes more difficult to spend at Target on these more “superfluous” items.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Returning to last quarter's performance, Target’s operating margin, excluding some non-recurring items, was reasonable, only slightly worse than Q3 2024, and the gross margin also remained stable, a positive point in my view. Also, Target did not have to give up margin to maintain some growing segments, such as running a super promotion on beverages that did well in the quarter. There were even some markdowns and other pressures, but nothing to worry about.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why Could This Be The Turning Point For Target?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even with this mixed quarter, it's not that hard to understand why the market is treating this as a pivot point. Q3 earnings were the last quarter for the former CEO, who handed over the reins to Michael Fiddelke and mentioned in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845599-target-corporation-tgt-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a> that he supports the entire team “as they make changes to the way we work.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Basically, it's a management transition, and this has already come with some interesting initiatives. Remember I said that beverages grew well? It was about 7% YoY, and this is related to these initiatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The new CEO mentioned that he is adopting AI-enabled insights to increase the levels of newness at Target. More than that, he mentioned “3 key priorities”: merchandising authority, the digital experience, and efficiency:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>“Michael Fiddelke, Executive VP &amp; COO, identified three key priorities: “solidify our design-led merchandising authority... offer a more consistently elevated experience across our stores and digital platforms... more fully use technology to improve our speed, guest experience and efficiency throughout the business.” He confirmed a recent headquarters restructuring eliminated about 1,800 roles, “a difficult but necessary step forward.”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, we are already seeing this happen. In the image below, it is noteworthy that digital comp sales continued to grow even with consolidated comp sales falling, not to mention that in assortment highlights, Target got it right with products and positioning of trends such as Halloween, college, beverages, etc. Consider that if the execution had really been poor, and Target had not been able to ride these trends, the performance would have been even worse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722241645347722_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1526\" data-height=\"812\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722241645347722_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Target highlights - Digital and newness\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"341\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722241645347722_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722241645347722_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722241645347722_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722241645347722_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Target IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And I believe this will be crucial in Q4, which <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT/earnings\">will be reported</a> on March 3rd. Obviously, I don't think anyone is expecting high, positive comp sales. In fact, the guidance is for declining revenue, and the market expects a -1.4% drop in revenue. But if the current management proves that it has at least managed to stem this, I think it could be bullish for Target.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, I'm not talking about aggressively growing the top line, but showing, for example, that it managed to decline revenue by “only” 0.5%, showing that digital and “newness” initiatives are really bringing good results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other than that, I believe that guidance for Q1 may be even more important. Even if turnarounds take time, I think Q1 could be the real turning point, where the CEO points out that with these initiatives, revenue may stop bleeding, and that with efficiency gains, margins may already improve, which would lead to at least a slight increase in the bottom line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This would open up a lot of room for Target's prospects to return to health, and then shareholders could once again envision shareholder value compounding, even if at a slow pace.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TGT Stock: Not A Bargain Anymore</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And TGT's valuation is still not bad. The forward P/E is 15x, and its average over the last 5 years is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT/valuation/metrics\">17x</a>, so we are still talking about a certain discount. The same is true for metrics such as EV-to-Sales and EV-to-EBITDA. The discount here is close to -20%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722241934879851_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"941\" data-height=\"893\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722241934879851_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TGT - Valuation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"607\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722241934879851_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722241934879851_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722241934879851_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57960026-17722241934879851_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And even though the dividend yield has fallen because TGT stock has risen, the market expects a forward dividend yield of close to 4%, which makes some sense.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Target manages to grow its EPS a little, which is likely with the new initiatives and some buybacks, it is already easy to estimate an EPS of around $7.50. If it distributes something close to 60%, the dividend per share goes to $4.50, and with the stock at $110, this gives us exactly a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT/dividends/scorecard\">4% dividend yield</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's far from bad, but in the last article, if the dividend per share were $4, the dividend yield would already be 4.7%. It's now clear that to deliver a higher shareholder yield, Target needs to execute; it needs to really deliver a little more than the “minimum.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Do I think Target will deliver? Yes, it seems likely to me, which is why I am not giving it a sell rating. But besides no longer being the bargain it once was, the execution risks still exist. Everything I mentioned seems very positive to me—initiatives, new management—but we need to see how it all plays out.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And with Q4 earnings coming up, I prefer to be a little more cautious and have a little more data to work with to see if Target can really reach its turning point or if it will take a little longer.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Target is a case that still deserves some attention, but I don't think the risk-reward ratio is that attractive anymore. And patience in these more complex cases, in my view, is welcome. Maybe the stock will rise a little more if Q4 earnings are much better than the market expects, but I think it makes more sense to wait and see how this actually plays out over the next 1 or 2 quarters.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, my rating for TGT stock is now a Hold.</p>",

However, FS KKR Capital Corp (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FSK\" title=\"FS KKR Capital Corp\">FSK</a></span>) has unfortunately suffered from a much larger pullback compared<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to the majority of peer BDCs out here. When I previously covered FSK, I issued a </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4841571-fs-kkr-capital-q3-earnings-reinforces-limited-growth-potential-reiterate-sell\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">sell rating</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> due to the poor earnings growth, questionable dividend coverage, and declining NAV. FSK has recently reported its Q4 earnings, which prompted me to revisit the BDC's appeal and value proposition at this time. Despite already trading near all-time lows, I believe that there may be additional downside risks for investors to consider.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the performance over the last twelve months, we can see that FSK's share price continues to experience severe erosion and has declined by more than 51%. Even when including all distributions that were paid out to shareholders, the total return still sits at a loss of 33.6% over the same time frame. Following the declines, FSK's starting dividend yield has ballooned up to ~16.2%. However, this follows a large dividend reduction that was implemented over the last quarter as earnings have struggled to support payouts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_21b26822490dbae94395fb2c9b9f4bc4.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_21b26822490dbae94395fb2c9b9f4bc4.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_21b26822490dbae94395fb2c9b9f4bc4.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_21b26822490dbae94395fb2c9b9f4bc4.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There continue to be structural flaws within FSK's portfolio setup that limit returns. FSK has struggled to allocate a meaningful level of capital towards new investments, and I worry about the underwriting on the new loans that are implemented. Although FSK's non-accruals don't appear that high, they still sit considerably higher than peers. Overall, there just don't seem to be any compelling catalysts for growth in the near term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to the latest <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/96/123096/original.pdf\">portfolio overview</a>, FSK has investments at a fair value of $13B, which is a decline from the prior fair value of $13.4B. Unlike traditional equities, FSK doesn't rely on the earnings growth of its assets. Instead, the BDC invests in a portfolio of different debt securities that produce income from a borrower's ability to repay loans. FSK maintains a high level of diversity across its investment types but leans most heavily on first lien senior secured loans. The portfolio's updated breakdown by investment type is as follows:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>First Lien Senior Secured Loans: 57.8%.</li> <li>Joint Venture (Credit Opportunities Partner): 15.1%.</li> <li>Asset Based Finance: 13%.</li> <li>Preferred Equity: 6.1%.</li> <li>Second Lien Senior Secured Loans: 4.2%.</li> <li>Equity/Other: 2.4%.</li> <li>Subordinated Debt: 1%.</li> <li>Other Senior Secured Debt: 0.4%.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expanding on this diversity, FSK also provides exposure to a wide range of sectors. I believe that one of the challenges comes from FSK's primary allocation to software &amp; service investments at 16.4% of the portfolio. As the tech sector continues to sell off due to threats around AI, perhaps FSK's own positions are experiencing challenges in the current environment. This is followed by an allocation to commercial &amp; professional services and health care equipment, which accounts for 13.3% and 12.8% of assets, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721254203945682_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"708\" data-height=\"340\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721254203945682_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FSK portfolio breakdown by sector\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"307\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721254203945682_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721254203945682_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721254203945682_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721254203945682_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FSK Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FSK just reported its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557145-fs-kkr-capital-nii-of-052-misses-by-002\">Q4 earnings</a>, and the results continue to disappoint. Most notably, adjusted net investment income amounted to $0.52 per share, which missed expectations by $0.02 and was a decline from the prior year's adjusted net investment income of $0.66 per share. Total investment income landed at $348M for the quarter, where the largest contributor to the decline is the reduction in interest income received from borrowers. For instance, interest income landed at $201M, which was a large reduction from the prior year's interest income of $257M.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721257141910374_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1880\" data-height=\"738\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721257141910374_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FSK financial highlights\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"251\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721257141910374_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721257141910374_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721257141910374_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721257141910374_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FSK Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similarly, FSK suffered from a large net realized loss of $244M during the quarter, which continues to demonstrate how higher rates may be suppressing the growth of its positions. Over the last twelve months, FSK hasn't really been able to lock in any meaningful net realized gains, so this issue may go beyond the higher interest rates. I believe this ultimately comes down to the actual positions management selected since there are plenty of other BDCs that are capable of capturing realized gains on a consistent basis. For instance, I previously covered Gladstone Investment (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GAIN\" title=\"Gladstone Investment\">GAIN</a>), which captured net realized gains and experienced unrealized appreciation in its positions. Over the last year, we can see how these two BDCs have performed much differently in share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_7d1dc1b7f7e2e3a0f0c0b973a7a48307.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_7d1dc1b7f7e2e3a0f0c0b973a7a48307.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_7d1dc1b7f7e2e3a0f0c0b973a7a48307.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_7d1dc1b7f7e2e3a0f0c0b973a7a48307.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a more positive note, FSK was able to reduce its operating expenses to help partially offset its earnings. For instance, total operating expenses landed at $195M, which was a decline from the prior year's total operating expenses of $213M. The largest contributor to the lower expenses was the reduction in interest expense down to $110M and a reduction in incentive fees to $28M.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, FSK can certainly improve from a balance sheet perspective. FSK now has cash and equivalents of $181M, but this is a reduction from the prior year's cash and equivalents balance of $278M. Similarly, FSK's total debt rose up to $7.6B, which caused the debt-to-equity ratio to rise to 1.22x. As FSK becomes more dependent on debt to fuel growth, it is imperative that the new investments lead to higher earnings, or else these losses will continue to compound over time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation &amp; Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the time of my last coverage, FSK had fallen to a deep discount to NAV of 30.74%. Following the decline after this most recent earnings report, the current <a href=\"https://cefdata.com/funds/fsk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">discount to NAV</a> has widened to 36.24%, and I anticipate that it will erode past the 40% discount level as well. Referring to the red line on the graph below, we can see that FSK now trades at one of the deepest discount to NAV levels over the last decade, with the outlier being the dip experienced during the pandemic. This deep discount is a clear indication of the underlying challenges that the portfolio continues to face.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721254776764886_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1090\" data-height=\"636\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721254776764886_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FSK discount to NAV valuation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"373\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721254776764886_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721254776764886_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721254776764886_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-17721254776764886_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>CEF Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the primary issues that I have with FSK is the lack of capital being allocated towards new investments. The portfolio continues to bleed its NAV because exits and repayments outpace the new investment capital. For instance, FSK was able to allocate $1.09B towards new investment purchases during the quarter. However, this was offset by $1.33B in sales and redemptions, which ultimately resulted in a negative net investment activity of $236M. While this was technically offset by net sales in the joint venture investments of $528M, this isn't really enough to drive the needle forward for growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The struggle to allocate capital towards new investments is why the net investment income has not improved over the last year. Even worse, this sort of issue means that the portfolio is shrinking over time, which leads to NAV decay. FSK's NAV has struggled to regain any sort of meaningful positive momentum over the last year as sales and redemptions outpace new investments. For reference, here are the quarter-end NAV amounts:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Q4 2024: $23.64 per share.</li> <li>Q1 2025: $23.37 per share.</li> <li>Q2 2025: $21.93 per share.</li> <li>Q3 2025: $21.99 per share.</li> <li>Q4 2025: $20.89 per share.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a risk perspective, FSK's non-accrual rate now sits at 3.4% of fair portfolio value. While these may not seem that much higher than other BDC peers, I still worry about the long-term structure of the portfolio. Just as a quick reference point, here are the non-accrual rates for some peer BDCs that have recently reported earnings.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Gladstone Capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLAD\" title=\"Gladstone Capital\">GLAD</a>): 1.6% non-accrual rate at fair portfolio value.</li> <li>Ares Capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARCC\" title=\"Ares Capital\">ARCC</a>): 1.2% non-accrual rate at fair portfolio value.</li> <li>Blue Owl Capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OBDC\" title=\"Blue Owl Capital Corporation\">OBDC</a>): 1.1% non-accrual rate at fair portfolio value.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The failure to grow net investment income may be attributed to the macro environment, but I worry about the actual quality of management's underwriting on its loans. Higher interest rates mean that it is more costly for businesses to take on debt financing, which typically leads to fewer high quality deals in the market. So although FSK has technically continued to allocate some capital towards new investments, there's always the risk that these new investments aren't the highest quality deals out there. This can lead to underlying earnings growth in the future, even if interest rates continue to decline throughout 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So while the higher dividend yield may be enticing right now, I want to put emphasis on the fact that FSK has been one of the worst performing BDCs out there over the last year. If you still want exposure to the BDC sector and a double-digit yield, consider choosing one of the BDC ETFs available to investors that can reduce the risk of the sector.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>VanEck BDC Income ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIZD\" title=\"VanEck BDC Income ETF\">BIZD</a>): 12.5% dividend yield.</li> <li>Putnam BDC Income ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PBDC\" title=\"Putnam BDC Income ETF\">PBDC</a>): 11.4% dividend yield.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_99db597d8574aa6f20c3628ffdf806af.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_99db597d8574aa6f20c3628ffdf806af.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_99db597d8574aa6f20c3628ffdf806af.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_99db597d8574aa6f20c3628ffdf806af.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Reduction</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of the latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557330-fs-kkr-capital-slashes-quarterly-dividend-by-297-to-045-and-supplemental-distribution-of-003-per-share\">declared</a> quarterly distribution of $0.45 per share, the current dividend yield sits around 16.2% at the time of this writing. This represents a massive 29.7% cut to the prior distribution of $0.64 per share. However, we already knew this was coming since management announced a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4518167-fs-kkr-capital-outlines-10-percent-2026-dividend-yield-target-as-m-and-a-pipeline-grows-and\">targeted 10% distribution</a> at the time of its prior earnings report. Additionally, adjusted net investment income landed at $0.52 per share for the quarter, which indicates that the earnings are now supporting the base distributions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While FSK has done a great job at keeping payouts consistent in the past, I am glad that this cut was finally implemented. A lower payout will reduce the pressure for FSK to create a high level of income and can free up some cash that can be reallocated towards different growth initiatives or debt reduction. Although it may take some quarters for these shifts to materialize into higher earnings, I believe that this should ultimately slow the rate at which FSK's share price declines going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-1772125614820116_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1099\" data-height=\"404\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-1772125614820116_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FSK dividend history\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"235\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-1772125614820116_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-1772125614820116_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-1772125614820116_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/31369215-1772125614820116_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management also had a sizable amount of spillover income still, so there is a small supplemental distribution of $0.03 that is being paid over the next quarter. Therefore, there may continue to be additional supplemental distributions paid out over the remainder of the year so that management can shed its remaining spillover income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, distributions received from FSK do not offer any tax efficiency for investors. Since distributions are being supported by interest income, the distributions are classified as ordinary dividends, which have the greatest tax consequences for investors. Therefore, FSK would be best utilized within a tax-advantaged account for investors that want to limit their tax liabilities.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In conclusion, FSK remains a sell at this time. Even though the share price has experienced a rapid pullback from its prior levels, the downside risk remains as the NAV trends downward and the net investment income has not grown. As management struggles to allocate capital towards new investment activity, there are limited growth catalysts to look forward to. As long as interest rates remain elevated, the overall health of the portfolio may continue to decline. FSK is also more reliant on debt to fuel growth, supported by the higher debt-to-equity ratio. On the bright side, the lower distribution may help improve performance over the long term as it frees up some capital.</p>",

That said, the company's free cash flow guidance of $20 million still represents a substantial increase over the $3 million generated in 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Please note that ATEC will have to redeem the remaining $63.25 million of its 2026 0.75% convertible notes on August 1.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the company has sufficient cash on hand to deal with the convertible notes maturity, favorable market conditions might very well cause management to consider a refinancing transaction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I do not expect an outright equity offering at this point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation-wise, ATEC is currently trading at approximately 14x my 2027 EV/Adjusted EBITDA estimate, which is well below the <a href=\"https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/vebitda.html\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/vebitda.html\" target=\"_blank\">average</a> of the U.S. healthcare product industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assigning the industry average of 20x would yield a $20 price target:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/769697-17722199524910178.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Valuation and Price Target\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"544\" height=\"312\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/769697-17722199524910178.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/769697-17722199524910178.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/769697-17722199524910178.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Estimates</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While expectations for moderating growth and rather limited cash generation might have alienated some investors as of late, I don't consider this a cause for concern, particularly not given the company's long-standing pattern of outperforming sales targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, the recent weakness in the shares has presented another buying opportunity. Should ATEC continue to outperform expectations, I would expect the stock price to return to recent highs above $20.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consequently, I am reiterating my \"Buy\" rating on the company's shares while increasing my price target from $18.00 to $20.00.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As usual, the bull thesis is not without risks. Should the company fail to deliver on growth and profitability expectations, the stock price will almost certainly take a major hit.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Once again, Alphatec Holdings outperformed growth expectations in 2025. In addition, the company delivered vastly improved profitability and cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While expectations for moderately lower growth in 2026 have caused shares to drop in recent weeks, investors should remember the company's long-standing pattern of outperforming sales expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With management projecting an almost 50% increase in Adjusted EBITDA this year, I would consider the recent selloff a buying opportunity.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, I am reiterating my \"<em>Buy</em>\" rating on the shares while increasing my price target from $18.00 to $20.00. </p>",

This marks a clear inflection for Verizon, and it doesn't depend on any heroic operating performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bridge from $20.1bn to $21.5bn is pretty clear: Verizon's facing a CAPEX cliff. A little improvement in EBITDA will help, and gives the scope for the \"or more\" mention after $21.5bn.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/29440305-1772215738696167_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2050\" data-height=\"1136\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/29440305-1772215738696167_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"VZ earnings pres\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/29440305-1772215738696167_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/29440305-1772215738696167_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/29440305-1772215738696167_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/29440305-1772215738696167_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Verzion earnings presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating cashflow could be up from $37.1bn to $38bn.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So this $21.5bn in free cashflow on a $206bn market cap buys you a 10.4% free cashflow yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The dividend costs them $12bn. They'll probably buy back at least $3bn in shares (a drop in the water relative to market cap). That will leaves over $6bn for the company to pay down its debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the risk free rate at 3.6%, you're getting a full 2.2% more right now with Verizon, for a business which is getting FCF returns equal to 10% market cap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sure debt service is a big one at $131bn total debt. From $3.5bn of interest expenses in 2021, VZ's interest bill has swollen to likely $7bn in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From $38bn in operating expenses, that's quite a bite. But VZ is a cashflow machine which can easily beat the hurdle. If it had to it could stop the buyback and pay another 50% in interest without affecting the dividend whatsoever.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So yes lower rates would be a tailwind. Higher for longer continue to hold the financials back a bit, but they do not cause existential risks to VZ's dividend policy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Frontier acquisition adds a growth kicker</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before acquiring Frontier, VZ could only bundle wireless and fiber in 9 states.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These \"converged\" customers are much stickier. They churn at half the rate Which makes sense, if you have everything going through Verizon, you probably don't bother with switching so easily.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With Frontier, VZ can offer bundles in 31 states.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a true win win for VZ and its customers, as it can reduce customer spend by bundling, increase average revenue per user and decrease churn.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's why having Schulman who's ex-PayPal at the helm makes sense: he understands the metrics that change the math on recurring subscription businesses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management has clearly expressed that this will be Verizon's growth trajectory going forward. Good to see them turning away from a price hike campaign and into an increasing the value proposition campaign.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">T-Mobile (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T\" title=\"AT&amp;T Inc.\">T</a>) has no fiber to compete, and AT&amp;T (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T\" title=\"AT&amp;T Inc.\">T</a>) has a smaller fiber footprint, which is creating a deeper moat for VZ that will take market share from this structural reshuffling of the offering.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of all this, management expects $1bn of synergies by 2028. Even without the synergies, it makes sense.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: The tide has already turned</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VZ has yielded as much as 8.6% in the past 3 years. During the past 5 years it has yielded on average 6.4%. Today it yields 5.8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The yield has been compressing, which is to say that the price has been increasing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Verizon is undergoing a rerating, but the market hasn't fully appreciated it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They grew the dividend by 4.4%, which if can be maintained justifies a yield of 4-4.5%, which would suggest a $70 price tag.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While we've been picking up shares at below $40 over the years at the DFT, we have a target for buying below until it hits $52.5.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That means VZ is still in our buy zone, and I think a terrific time to add to the stock.</p>",

The company has currently moved from the stage of promising<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> potential to the stage where it makes sense to talk about implementation and value creation. This has happened mainly thanks to the large and already partially transferred audit base. It is also thanks to a large capital increase, which effectively extends the runway and allows the company to do work that the market can appreciate. Last but not least, I would like to mention the visibility of antimony as a potential co-product at a time when the domestic supply chain of strategic metals is politically and economically unstable.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My rating is based on a simple idea. The market usually prices development projects with a heavy discount, and in most cases, it does so brutally. Until it is clear who will pay for it and who will approve it. At THM, the first such block has just moved, the company has closed an upsized equity <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/international-tower-hill-mines-closes-upsized-us115-million-equity-financing-including-full-exercise-of-underwriters-option-302671837.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">financing</a> ($115 million), and at the same time, it is clear that large and strong investors are willing to add to their positions. Of course, this in itself does not solve the main obstacle in the form of billions in capex. However, it reduces the risk of an immediate death spiral of financing and increases the chance that the project will move to a stage where it can be financed normally (partnerships, debt, offtake, etc.).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I like most about the company is that it holds an asset that is easily readable for big players. P&amp;P reserves are approximately 9 Moz. To this we can add M&amp;I resources outside these reserves. This is exactly the type of foundation on which transactions can be built if the project team proves that it can improve the economics and reduce permitting uncertainty.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Bearings are not a problem, financing is the problem</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">International Tower Hill Mines is a single asset investment. The company holds a 100% stake in the <a href=\"https://www.ithmines.com/livengood-gold-project/project-highlights/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Livengood</a> Gold Project in Alaska. Livengood is located approximately 70 miles north of Fairbanks and is accessible by paved road. The whole story here comes down to one question, can Livengood move from being a large, capital heavy deposit to becoming a project that actually makes economic sense? I’ve looked at a few similar names before, including Vista Gold Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4766386-vista-gold-new-study-to-start-construction-behind-the-corner\">VGZ</a>) and Hycroft Mining Holding Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794937-hycroft-mining-gold-miner-with-a-lottery-ticket-profile\">HYMC</a>), and there are useful parallels there that also help frame this case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721261870854938_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"692\" data-height=\"508\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721261870854938_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Map of Livengood\" width=\"640\" height=\"470\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721261870854938_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721261870854938_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721261870854938_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721261870854938_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Map of Livengood <span>(lithmines - gallery)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering that this is a junior player, the project's ratios are more than satisfactory. P&amp;P 9 Moz Au (430.1 Mt @ 0.65 g/t, at a reference gold price of $1680 Oz) and, in addition, resources outside the M&amp;I reserves of 4.62 Moz (274.51 Mt @ 0.52 t/g). In other words, the size of the deposit is not a problem; the problem is the economics of the project at realistic costs, especially financing in the permitting phase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">THM is back in the game right now because in January 2026, they closed $115 million in upscaled financing through a combination of a public offering and a private placement. Importantly, the transaction documents explicitly describe the intended use of the funds.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>PFS shows high upside, but only with successful de-risking</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">THM is a project developer, and that is important to keep in mind. Because market valuation will primarily be based not on quarterly results, but on how quickly the company can move Livengood to a state where the project is financeable along with the permit. There are two sides to this type of investment. One is enormous leverage on the price of gold, and the other is enormous leverage on Capex and Cost of Capital. This is one of the reasons why THM makes sense to me, because the risk-reward ratio here is asymmetrical compared to other options.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key document for understanding the company's current valuation is the <a href=\"https://www.ithmines.com/_resources/presentations/Nov-2021-PFS-presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">PFS</a>, which was published in 2021 and subsequently revised in subsequent technical reports. The PFS puts on paper what the market has been thinking for years, capex is massive. The estimate for initial capex was $1.93 billion, sustaining capex is $658 million, and reclamation &amp; closure is $322 million. AISC life of mine comes out to $1,171/oz in the first 5 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And that is why the company has behaved like a high beta proxy for gold in the past. With lower gold prices and higher capital discounts, it looks like a very bad investment. But with higher gold prices and the market's willingness to finance long-term projects, it looks like massive leverage on the price of gold without the use of options.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721260458023288_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"818\" data-height=\"213\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721260458023288_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Table. with Beta of my covered stocks\" width=\"640\" height=\"167\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721260458023288_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721260458023288_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721260458023288_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721260458023288_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Beta of my covered stocks <span>(SeekingAlpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The following sensitivity is presented in the PFS:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>$1,500/oz, after tax NPV (5%) is minus $512 million, IRR -1%, payback 16.2 years</li> <li>$1,800/oz, after tax NPV (5%) is approximately $400 million, IRR +7.7%, payback 8.2 years</li> <li>$2000/oz, after tax NPV (5%) is approximately $975 million, IRR +11.2%, payback 6.3 years</li> <li>$2500/oz, after tax NPV (5%) is approximately $2.351 billion, IRR +18.5%, payback 3.9 years</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-1772126348898748_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1552\" data-height=\"1149\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-1772126348898748_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart of Exceptional Value based on gold price\" width=\"640\" height=\"474\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-1772126348898748_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-1772126348898748_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-1772126348898748_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-1772126348898748_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Exceptional Value based on gold price <span>(lithmines - PFS 2021)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The core of my thesis is therefore that THM is a proxy for a long duration gold asset. From this perspective, it is important that the company has raised fresh capital for work that increases the likelihood that this will become a realistically financeable project, rather than just a model in a PDF.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In January 2026, the company closed an upsizing of equity financing worth approximately $115 million, with the use of these funds being explicit. The funds will be used for drilling, metallurgy, feasibility, baseline environmental, detail engineering for permitting, legal support, community engagement, and payments for mineral leases. These are exactly the kinds of steps that can make the project more financeable and improve the odds of bringing in a partner. Personally, I was pleased with this financing because it shows that the big players are willing to keep up. Of course, this in itself does not guarantee success, but it increases the chance that the next steps will not be blind again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I also mentioned antimony. I see the <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/international-tower-hill-mines-provides-progress-report-on-antimony-metallurgy-study-at-the-livengood-gold-project-302546301.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">antimony</a> mineralization as a potential way to improve the project’s economics and possibly make the asset more attractive for future partnerships. The company announced encouraging results from the first phase, where they achieved liberation in the range of p80 - 250 microns in 54 stibnite veins. As in other cases I have written about previously, such as VGZ or HYMC, I am glad that they are trying to address the issue of how to increase the value of each ton mined without disrupting the simplicity of the entire process.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>THM is no longer concerned with survival, but with the effective use of capital</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the company has <a href=\"https://minedocs.com/30/Int-Tower-Hill-MDA-3Q-FY2025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">no revenue</a>, we will focus primarily on liquidity, cash burn, and cap table. This information will show us whether the company will expand or just survive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For a long time, the company was a typical junior in the \"let's save every $100k\" mode. In December 2024, the company <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1134115/000141057825000319/thm-20241231x10k.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> cash &amp; equivalents of $0.992 million and working capital of $0.96 million. Management also made it clear that the company had no revenue generating operations and was still reliant on equity financing. Cash briefly increased to $2.28 million during 2025, but that still was not enough to meaningfully advance the project. The real inflection point came in January 2026, when THM completed a $115 million financing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For 2024, the company reported a net loss of $3.599 million. From a liquidity standpoint, the key point is that management explicitly said the decline in cash was driven mainly by roughly $2.9 million used in operating activities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Paradoxically, this is both good and bad news for potential investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The good news is that G&amp;A has remained at relatively decent levels from the developers' perspective. The MD&amp;A shows that share-based payments ($613.7k) are a large item and that current operating costs are in the range of a few million per year. The bad news is that after January's financing, the burn rate will increase because it is no longer a matter of survival but of paying for technical and support services. The original cash burn will increase from the original $2 million to $4 million per year to tens of millions per year, with the rate depending on the program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If I translate this purely pragmatically, the company originally dealt with money on a monthly basis, but now the horizon has lengthened and finances can be dealt with over a period of years. From my perspective, that takes a lot of near-term pressure off the company and gives management more room to focus on longer-term objectives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now let’s look at the dilution from the January financing, which was completed at $2.22 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721264923339856_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1539\" data-height=\"1148\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721264923339856_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Table with capital structure\" width=\"640\" height=\"477\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721264923339856_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721264923339856_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721264923339856_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721264923339856_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">THM capital structure <span>(lithmines - corporate presentation feb-2026)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The underwritten public <a href=\"https://www.ithmines.com/news-and-media/news-releases/index.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">offering</a> was 29,280,000 shares, the underwriters' option was 4,392,000 shares, and the concurrent private placement was 18,018,018 shares (the buyer was Paulson &amp; Co. Inc.). <a href=\"https://www.mining.com/paulson-lifts-stake-in-international-tower-hill-with-alaska-gold-project\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Paulson</a> purchased $40 million worth of shares, and the company also reports that Paulson purchased an additional 1,501,982 shares for $3.3 million. At that time, THM had 207,885,473 outstanding shares. After the offering and concurrent PP, we reached 259,575,491 shares (an increase of +24.9%). In my view, this is relatively high dilution. However, it is necessary to distinguish between bad and good dilution. Bad dilution is when a company issues shares with the intention of merely surviving the next quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Good dilution is when a company issues shares to pay for more work that reduces overall risk and may increase the likelihood of success. From my point of view, the most important thing now is to monitor the differences between actual capital expenditure and the submitted plan. Management has indicated that around $50 million will go toward feasibility related work, with another roughly $35 million earmarked for permitting and community engagement. That makes sense on paper, but the real issue is execution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From here, the key metric is not just how much cash is spent but whether that spending leads to clear and measurable progress. If the burn rate starts to outrun visible deliverables, that would be the first sign that the story is going off track. We know from history that the burn rate was not extreme, but as we wrote above, that will change. Last but not least, it is necessary to take into account the overhang options. The prospectus lists options in the amount of 2,215,000 and DSU 3,476,102, which is not a devastating amount compared to 260 million shares, but it is good to keep it in mind and take into account the possible impact on the price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>THM valuation is not based on accounting, but on the probability of realization</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this company, it is not about P/E valuation or EBITDA. In our investment thesis, we have approached THM as a discounted project with an asymmetric risk-reward ratio. The size and quality of asset reserves compared to capex, cost of capital, and permitting risk are significant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721265926077602_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1538\" data-height=\"1144\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721265926077602_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Table with EV/In valuation analysis\" width=\"640\" height=\"476\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721265926077602_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721265926077602_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721265926077602_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721265926077602_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EV/In valuation analysis <span>(lithmines - corporate presentation feb-2026)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NPV (5%) is not just a model with an implicit cost of capital. For projects like this, with high capex and a long payback period, a 5% discount is extremely favorable. In practice, the market often implicitly uses a higher discount (8-12%) and adds a probability haircut for permitting and financing. Therefore, it is not surprising that THM has historically not traded anywhere near its NPV. Furthermore, gold is not currently trading at $1680/oz, but even that is still not reflected in the NPV on a 1:1 basis. Even though the spot price of gold is higher than the reference price in reserves, a developer without a clear path to financing and project implementation will not be valued as a finished <a href=\"https://resourcecapitalfunds.com/insights/mining-and-minerals-101/mining-investment-a-guide-to-understanding-valuations/\" rel=\"nofollow\">producer</a>. The market will not pay you the NPV, the market will pay the probability that it will ever reach the NPV. And that is the essential information, because THM bought time in January to make itself bankable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is certainly worth looking at the primitive parameter, which I have also used in other projects that I have analyzed and mentioned above. THM reports P&amp;P reserves at 9Moz Au. For developers, we often see ranges between $20 and $100/oz (however, it depends greatly on the jurisdiction, grade, apex, inda, permitting, and, most importantly, the price of gold and sentiment).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EV per ounce is a primitive metric, but it is useful for checking whether a project is completely off track. Livengood is a low-grade, high-tonnage, high-capex project. This naturally pushes us into the lower half of EV/oz. It is important whether capex can be reduced, whether permitting will be feasible, and whether a partner will emerge who can handle the financing. Given the structure of THM as described above, EV/oz will not rise simply because the price of gold has gone up. THM becomes much more interesting as the odds of the project actually moving forward start to improve. In cases like this, I tend to think about valuation as project NPV adjusted for execution probability, with an added haircut for capex risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721266465788107_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1535\" data-height=\"1162\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721266465788107_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Table with Livengood parameters\" width=\"640\" height=\"484\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721266465788107_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721266465788107_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721266465788107_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721266465788107_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Livengood parameters <span>(lithmines - corporate presentation feb-2026)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For THM to start being valued at higher multiples, approaching those of producers, there needs to be an overall improvement in feasibility, permitting, the conclusion of long-term partnerships, and the use of antimony. I am aware of gaps here which, if filled, could significantly advance the company. The broader backdrop is also becoming more supportive. With sentiment improving, geopolitics staying relevant, and gold holding up well, the project is starting to look more economically realistic, which could make THM more compelling to investors than it was before.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The main risk is not gold, but foreclosure</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since, as in other cases, this is only a project awaiting implementation, I consider it very important to mention the risks associated with a possible investment in THM. There are still risks associated with this company that have historically kept its valuation low and have long made THM more of a proxy leverage beta on the price of gold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s capex is so large that it puts serious pressure on the whole investment case unless the financing structure and other key assumptions improve. At the same time, that kind of imbalance is not unusual for a company of this size. However, this is a key risk that will end in disaster without a good partner and a smart financing structure. The market will never pay NPV until it sees that someone else is willing to put hundreds of millions and billions into a project with a long-term return, that long-term nature is key here. If THM keeps issuing more shares without clearly showing what progress is being made, I do not see much reason to stay in the position.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next, I would like to mention the <a href=\"https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/2021?amount=100\" rel=\"nofollow\">cost of inflation</a>, which can render the PFS completely irrelevant, given that it dates from 2021. Since then, there have been significant changes in labor costs, material costs, energy prices, and the very structure of supply chains. In addition, the rate regime itself has changed, and with it the associated cost of capital. Even though the price of gold has risen, higher capex and higher discounts can wipe out a significant portion of these benefits. This is key information because the sensitive PFS shows that the project's economics are not concentrated around 0 but are extremely sensitive to inputs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At lower gold prices, the NPV is negative, while at higher prices it is positive. This means that any shift in capex or discount will significantly reduce the resulting valuation. If management releases a newer project economics report where they make excuses about macroeconomics instead of presenting engagement, that's a red flag for me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721261187348435_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"808\" data-height=\"387\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721261187348435_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart with dollar buying power since 2021\" width=\"640\" height=\"307\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721261187348435_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721261187348435_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721261187348435_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/61434374-17721261187348435_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Buying power since 2021 <span>(in2013dollars)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although, from my point of view, management has been responsible within limits so far, I see another significant risk on the part of the execution itself. The company can burn through new cash without anything happening. The biggest risk after January's financing is not that the cash will run out, but that it will be spent and nothing will come of it. The new prospectuses clearly describe what is supposed to happen with the finances, but the question remains whether this will actually happen. If two quarters pass and the only communication is that we are continuing our work without any further concrete results, I will leave my position. The macro <a href=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/commodities/gold-prices\" rel=\"nofollow\">outlook</a> for the price of the stock may be fine, but unfortunately that means nothing for THM.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusions</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, stability is not about monitoring fundamentals, but about monitoring changes in probability that lead to successful implementation. The currently available information gives me an overall view that I rate as BUY. With its January financing, THM bought itself time and relatively large space to move Livengood from a geological asset to a state that the market can take seriously.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key is that further potential upside no longer depends solely on the price of gold. Management has capital at its disposal that can achieve concrete de-risking, better feasibility, visible permitting, and the possible finding of partnerships. If this is truly successful, then the current valuation may seem significantly low in retrospect. I view the overall position in THM as rather speculative, but rationally justifiable for a BUY rating. It is definitely not for investors seeking certainty. It is a position for investors who understand that they are buying risk-reward asymmetry here.</p>",

(</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMCI\" title=\"Super Micro Computer, Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">SMCI</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">). SMCY has an expense ratio of 0.99% and an extremely high distribution rate: 85.83%. Distributions are paid on a weekly basis. SMCY is a small, but quite liquid ETF, with $150 million in assets under management and an average daily trading volume of $11 million. The fund’s issuer, </span><a href=\"https://www.yieldmaxetfs.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">YieldMax ETFs</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">, is specialized in options-based income ETFs, including a series of single-stock products such as this one.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Strategy</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As described in the prospectus by YieldMax ETFs,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>the Fund uses either a synthetic covered call strategy or a synthetic covered call spread strategy to provide income and indirect exposure to the share price returns of SMCI.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This strategy provides income from the option premiums and exposure to the price returns of SMCI with a limit to the upside. The fund doesn’t invest directly in SMCI, only in options based on it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A covered call strategy consists in investing in an asset and selling (“writing”) one or more call options on it for a premium. In a synthetic covered call strategy, the long position in the asset is replaced with a “synthetic long” using a combination of options designed to replicate the asset’s price return. A synthetic long consists in buying call options and selling put options on the underlying asset with a strike price approximately equal to the asset’s price at the time of initiating the positions. These options typically have one-month to six month terms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund may also use synthetic covered call spreads. Instead of just selling a call against the synthetic long, it will then sell a call and buy another call with a higher strike price for the same expiration date. Buying an additional call reduces the premium income, but also limits the risk of loss on the short call, should the underlying stock price surge beyond expectation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, the fund holds treasuries (mostly short term) as collateral for option contracts, which also participates in income generation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, SMCY executes an options strategy on SMCI to emulate the stock and generate income.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Portfolio</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SMCY has 92% of net asset value in cash equivalents and short-term treasuries, and 11 positions in SMCI options, whose notional values are not specified by YieldMax ETFs.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>A long call and a short put corresponding to a synthetic long expiring on 3/20/2026.</li> <li>Five short calls and four long calls expiring on 3/27/2026 with different strike prices.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Laddering call spreads with different strike prices may reduce the risk compared to having only one. The portfolio composition is an example from 2/26/2026 and may have changed by the time you read this. While the exact holdings and options will change, the strategy remains the same: generating high income writing laddered covered calls.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Fundamentals</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Super Micro Computer, the underlying security in SMCY, is classified by GICS in the Information Technology sector and in the Technology Hardware, Storage &amp; Peripherals industry. Based on Seeking Alpha’s quantitative factor grades, the company has good valuation and growth characteristics, but average momentum and profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-17721243457391748.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SMCI quantitative factor grades\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"177\" height=\"149\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">SMCI quantitative factor grades <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seeking Alpha’s aggregate quantitative ranking puts SMCI in third position in its industry among 27 companies, behind Sandisk Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SNDK\" title=\"Sandisk Corporation\">SNDK</a>) and Dell Technologies Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DELL\" title=\"Dell Technologies Inc.\">DELL</a>). SMCY does not provide good exposure to the growth potential of this underlying asset due to the aggressive call strategy designed to produce income.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Historical Performance</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SMCY has underperformed SMCI by 12.8% in total return between its inception and 2/26/2026. The fund has a short history and this gap may not be representative of its long term potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-17721242941806087_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"665\" data-height=\"230\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-17721242941806087_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SMCY vs. SMCI total return\" width=\"640\" height=\"221\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-17721242941806087_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-17721242941806087_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-17721242941806087_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-17721242941806087_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">SMCY vs. SMCI total return <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this time frame, SMCY shows a 84% loss in share price, partly offset by high distributions. It's total return, like for many similar ETFs, looks better but assumes the reinvestment of these distributions. This NAV decay also impedes a sustainable, growing total return as income is generated on an ever-shrinking asset amount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-17721244194728613_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"665\" data-height=\"230\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-17721244194728613_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SMCY price return\" width=\"640\" height=\"221\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-17721244194728613_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-17721244194728613_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-17721244194728613_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-17721244194728613_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">SMCY price return <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NAV erosion is an intrinsic consequence of the asymmetrical option strategy. SMCY fully participates in the downside moves of SMCI through the synthetic long, while its upside is limited by the covered call or cover call spreads. The negative bias is stronger for a volatile stock like SMCI. This pattern will continue in the future, with little or no erosion in slow trends, and steep decay in volatile times.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The distributions were monthly until 10/15/2025, then became weekly. The next two charts show that they have been on a downtrend in both periods, although they have slightly increased in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-1772124230867985.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Monthly distributions until 10/15/25\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"636\" height=\"281\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-1772124230867985.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-1772124230867985.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-1772124230867985.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Monthly distributions until 10/15/25 <span>(Chart: author; data: YieldMax ETFs)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-1772124178323433.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Weekly distributions from 10/22/25\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"639\" height=\"268\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-1772124178323433.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-1772124178323433.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-1772124178323433.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Weekly distributions from 10/22/25 <span>(Chart: author; data: YieldMax ETFs)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This also makes the strategy prone to reverse splits. While it has not undergone a reverse split to date at the time of writing, this is a distinct possibility in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its income and tax character of return of capital (“ROC”) are very variable: ROC has varied between 0% and 96% in 2026. It may be an issue for tax predictability and has an impact on the net profit of an investment in SMCY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, the distribution paid on 02/27/2026 was 62.60% ROC and 37.40% income, as reported in the table below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-17721241413984501.png?io=w640\" alt=\"% ROC in 2026\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"316\" height=\"371\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/2496631-17721241413984501.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">% ROC in 2026 <span>(YieldMax ETFs)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>SMCY vs. Peers</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next table compares characteristics of SMCY and seven of the YieldMax Option Income Strategy ETF series based on the Magnificent Seven:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDY\" title=\"YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF\">NVDY</a>), based on NVIDIA Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>)</li> <li>YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APLY\" title=\"YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF\">APLY</a>), based on Apple Inc.
