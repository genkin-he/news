To start with, uranium production surprised on the upside, as mined amounts came in 20% higher than the top end of the guidance range (see table below) and 49% higher than the midpoint of the guidance range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similarly, processed uranium production was also a shade higher than the top-end of the guidance, and 20% higher than the midpoint.

This is a complete reversal from my expectations last year, which had forecast a 56% drop in the number. Instead, the actuals came in 189% higher. This was for two reasons:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>At the time of these estimates, the midpoint sales guidance itself was lower at 250,000 pounds, which was subsequently revised upwards by 40%. And as earlier mentioned, the actual sales significantly exceeded even the upwardly revised guidance.</li> <li>Next, the realized uranium price assumption was USD 66.7 per pound, based on the price at that time. The actual figure was 11.2% higher at USD 74.2 per pound.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">...but heavy mineral sands affect revenues</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even then, though, total revenues contracted by 15.6% due to a pullback in revenues for heavy mineral sands, which represent the rare earths segment for Energy Fuels. Heavy mineral sands' revenue, dropped by 60% after the closure of the Kwale mine in Kenya in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The pullback in total revenue wasn't surprising, though, as my estimates had forecast a drop in uranium revenues. If anything, the extent of the drop was a relief. Even with an assumption of unchanged heavy mineral sands' revenues, a 27.6% drop in revenue was projected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With revenue weakness anticipated, I also pencilled in a loss in 2025, which also came to pass. In fact, the loss ballooned by 1.8x due to costs associated with the company's acquisition of the Australian rare earths producer Base Resources in late 2024, as well as expenses related to the company's expansion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Exceptional revenue growth to be seen in 2026</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenues in 2026, however, can look significantly better, based on the company's production and sales guidance as well as its recent acquisition of another rare earths producer, Australian Strategic Materials (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ASMMF\" class=\"ticker-link\">OTCPK:ASMMF</a>). The details are below:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li> <strong>Robust production outlook for uranium:</strong> The production outlook for 2026 is robust, with a 31% increase in mined uranium and a much bigger 97% increase in processed uranium expected at the midpoint of the guidance ranges as provided (see table below). But the biggest increase is expected in sales, of 169%. Even if realised uranium price were to remain unchanged from 2025 and heavy mineral sands' revenues were to be nil, Energy Fuels would still see a near doubling in revenues from 2025.</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722092940245857_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2328\" data-height=\"547\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722092940245857_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Outlook, 2026\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"150\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722092940245857_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722092940245857_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722092940245857_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722092940245857_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Outlook, 2026 <span>(Source: Energy Fuels)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"><li> <strong>Expanding rare earths production potential:</strong> Next, there's the company's recent decision to acquire the rare earths producer Australian Strategic Materials through a share swap agreement plus a special dividend payout. This could add marginally to revenues as well, as Australian Strategic Materials has seen average annual revenues of USD 2.8 million over the past five years.</li></ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, Energy Fuels' losses could increase even further in 2026, considering that Australian Strategic Materials' net losses have averaged USD 13.6 million annually over the past five years. For context, this amounts to ~16% of Energy Fuels' loss in 2025.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stronger longer-term prospects...</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking beyond this year, there are solid developments underway that can continue to support Energy Fuels' growth over the longer term, both from the perspective of rare earths and uranium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Russia and China hold dominant global positions in the supply of processed uranium and rare earths, respectively. With the US at loggerheads with both, ensuring security for these critical minerals has been underlined in recent times. Companies like Energy Fuels are well suited to make gains from this strategic development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It was already the biggest uranium producer in the US, and after its acquisition of Australian Strategic Materials, it has also become the biggest rare earths producer outside of China. While its rare earths' production is nil right now, the company aims to start producing dysprosium and terbium, both of which are restricted by China, in early 2027. Further, construction on the Vara Mada project in Madagascar, with <a href=\"https://www.mining.com/energy-fuels-estimates-1-8b-value-38-year-life-for-madagascar-mineral-sands-project/#:~:text=The%20Vara%20Mada%20project%20was,following%20refinements%20and%20further%20drilling.\" rel=\"nofollow\">promising financials</a> and a mine life of 38 years, is due to start in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the meantime, the company's uranium production can continue to benefit from the solid prospects as nuclear energy receives significant policy support and demand from big tech to power up their data centres.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">...but price run-up indicates stretched valuations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In financial terms, however, the extreme price run-up means that the stock is seeing stretched valuations. For 2026, my estimates indicate that the company can see a revenue of USD 130 million, which results in a forward P/S of 41.7x. This is much lower than the stock's five-year average forward ratio of 65.9x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the extreme price increase over the past year means that it's no longer a reliable indicator of what's next for the price. With uranium production and sales expected to be Energy Fuels' dominant focus in 2026, I compared how the stock stands against Cameco Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCJ\" title=\"Cameco Corporation\">CCJ</a>) instead. The big Canadian miner's forward P/S for this year is at a far smaller 20.2x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the company expected to turn profitable next year (see graphic below), over the longer term, the forward P/E is the relevant market multiple to consider. For 2029, analysts estimates on Seeking Alpha indicate a forward ratio of 51.9x. This, too, remains at least slightly high. For CCJ, the corresponding figure is at ~47x. I also compared it with the rare earths' producer MP Materials (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MP\" title=\"MP Materials Corp.\">MP</a>), which is at 27.2x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722529403635726_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2376\" data-height=\"893\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722529403635726_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Consensus EPS estimates\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"241\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722529403635726_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722529403635726_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722529403635726_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48723034-17722529403635726_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's next?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Whichever way the valuations are considered, they look high right now. Of course, the company has projects underway, like Vara Mada, with promising estimates. But it will take a while to operationalise and the actuals could turn out different than current estimates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, there's a lot going for Energy Fuels right now. In terms of its critical minerals focus and its leading position as a US-based producer, it's in just the right position to reap the benefits of supportive policies. The company's latest production and sales numbers for uranium are only encouraging, and its outlook for 2026 is even more so.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The best course of action right now, would be to buy on any significant dips that reflect reduced market multiples. Otherwise, it's best to wait for more stability in financials before taking a call, especially for long-term investors. I'm retaining a Hold rating.</p>",

While the entire market sold off, the BDC sector got hammered extra hard and remained subdued for a longer time than the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then once everyone realized that actually the tariffs won’t have as drastic consequences as initially thought and the BDCs continued to deliver solid credit quality statistics, it took less than 4 months for the recovery process to get abrupted again. This time it was the bankruptcy of First Brands and Tricolor and the corresponding <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829881-jpmorgan-chase-and-co-jpm-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">“cockroach” phrase</a> that threw the BDCs back to square one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some months later, realizing that the promised cockroaches were somehow not emerging, the market initiated BDC recovery process again, which lasted until late January, 2026, when the SaaS aspect started to gain traction as a reason for BDC repricing. And here the dynamics at one of Blue Owl Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OWL\" title=\"Blue Owl Capital Inc.\">OWL</a>) private BDCs (OBDC II) came into play right around the same time, when SaaS selloff was at its peak moment. As a result of this combination, almost all BDCs plunged and entered into even steeper discount zones.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, the market is <a href=\"https://www.raymondjames.com/-/media/rj/dotcom/files/corporations-and-institutions/investment-banking/industry-insight/bdc_update.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">assuming</a> that about 23% of BDC NAVs (this includes the leverage effects) are effectively worthless.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The question becomes whether this time it is different. Could it be so that the BDC SaaS exposures (which are indeed material for many BDCs) fail and get converted to non-performing assets?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I doubt it because of the following (in no particular order):</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>In the Q4 earning call, the BDC management teams have all expressed no fears about SaaS investment blowout in their portfolios.</li> <li>The non-accrual levels of the BDCs that have so far reported their Q4 reports have remained rock-solid and in most cases the underlying companies have reported growing EBITDA generation levels.</li> <li>BDCs differ from broadly syndicated loan market as they typically implement strict underwriting standards, which come with conservative covenants and ample margin of safety (e.g., interest coverage levels at 2x+ and LTVs below 50%).</li> <li>The SaaS-driven non-accrual risk sounds like a broken record. It is only logical that BDCs go through cycles as they are inherently cyclical investments. And usually right at the cyclical lows, it is when bargain opportunities emerge that can warrant greater upside than just the offered dividend. This is what happened in the GFC, COVID-19, in 2022 when the interest rates were surging etc.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having said that, I fully appreciate the fact that for some investors venturing into BDCs at their cyclical lows when the risks are elevated and the future seems very uncertain might not be acceptable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, it could be so that the level of stress that would come with making BDC bets right would not compensate for the extra return potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, with this in mind, I would like to elaborate on two bulletproof BDCs, which could be bought right now, knowing that both portfolios and dividends are isolated from the SaaS-induced non-accruals.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2 durable NAV and safe dividend BDC picks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If I had to recommend two BDCs, which, in my view, offer the strongest level of protection from not only SaaS bankruptcies but also from a system-wide credit stress in the private credit space, I would go with Capital Southwest (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSWC\" title=\"Capital Southwest\">CSWC</a>) and Main Street Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MAIN\" title=\"Main Street Capital Corporation\">MAIN</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It does not mean that these are my highest conviction buys from an attractive total return perspective, but certainly these would be picks that I could see in prudent retirement income investor's portfolio for whom a base dividend cut or a permanent value impairment is not an option.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me share four reasons, which should substantiate my stance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, it depends on a BDC, but many of the largest and well-known BDCs such as Sixth Street Specialty Lending (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLX\" title=\"Sixth Street Specialty Lending, Inc.\">TSLX</a>), Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BXSL\" title=\"Blackstone Secured Lending Fund.\">BXSL</a>) and Blue Owl Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OBDC\" title=\"Blue Owl Capital Corporation\">OBDC</a>) (but I could go on and on) carry meaningful exposures to SaaS sector. Typically, the portfolio bias towards SaaS is somewhere between 15% to 25%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, for both CSWC and MAIN the exposure to SaaS is below 5%. In CSWC's <a href=\"https://ir.capitalsouthwest.com/static-files/2fe3ecb1-cc82-4310-bce4-61b342d732f3\" rel=\"nofollow\">case</a> we cannot see it at a granular level, but given that it is not present in the Top 10 industry mix, which has 4% as the lowest mark, we can draw a conclusion that for CSWC the SaaS segment consumes less than 4% of the total book. For MAIN we can see this more clearly - i.e., SaaS accounts for ~2% of the LMM <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_2afe6f504d7c4121ebef0996b4c5e9e2/mainstcapital/db/396/11026/pdf/Q3+2025+MAIN+Investor+Presentation+v.ENDNOTES+-+vF+-+FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">loan book</a> and less than 8% of the private credit loan book (on a weighted average basis it translates to sub 4% exposure).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Already here we can basically neutralize the SaaS blowout risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, CSWC and MAIN invest with a strong margin of safety. The average portfolio company for these two BDCs has more robust leverage and interest coverage metrics than what we typically see for core middle market names.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, the weighted average leverage for CSWC portfolio company is only 3.6x, while the sector average falls closer to 4.5x. For MAIN's portfolio investments the leverage metric is even lower. And for example, the EBITDA to senior interest coverage is at 3.0x for MAIN's LMM investments, which means that the company would have to lose about two thirds of its EBITDA (business) to cause some real headache for the BDC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third, CSWC and MAIN are very well-positioned to expand their portfolios further, which should in turn result in incremental NII generation that could, in the worst case, be used to offset pressures from non-accruals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are two elements to take into account when thinking about growth capacities:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Additional borrowings. CSWC has a debt to equity of 1.08x, which is meaningfully below the sector average of 1.20x and a clear indicative of available debt capacity for growth in a financially prudent manner. For MAIN the debt load is much lower - i.e., debt to equity of 0.74x, which ranks it as the third lowest debt BDC out there.</li> <li>Fresh and accretive equity. Since CSWC and MAIN are internally managed BDCs and carry high-quality portfolios they trade at relatively healthy valuations, where the P/NAVs are above 1.0x. The presence of above NAV multiples enables accretive equity issuances that can provide capital for portfolio growth. Majority of BDCs do not have this (access to equity capital) available.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fourth, and this is also quite unique and important in the context of NAV stability and dividend durability, both BDCs could be deemed as equity-biased. Namely, the portfolios are saturated with high-quality equity investments, which can unlock further upside in the form of realized gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CSWC has 9.1% of its portfolio tied to high-quality equity investments. For MAIN the figure is even higher as the cumulative pre-tax net unrealized appreciation of its equity investments accounts for 11.7% of the total market cap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, the benefit of the equity tilt is that as these investments get monetized (happens periodically) they result in notable equity-like gains, which can balance out the headwinds from non-accruals or contribute to further NAV and dividend growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final words</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What we are currently seeing is yet another reminder that BDCs are cyclical instruments. When the sentiment shifts, they quickly drop into a deeply discounted zone, which is actually the right time to buy. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, going out in the market and scooping up discounted names, while the storm is still in the process is difficult. The risk of stepping into value traps is for sure higher than in normal times. Also, opening BDC positions right now might not necessarily be a stress-free exercise, which is also a critical aspect for many investors that I fully respect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So here I see a merit of buying CSWC and MAIN names, which still produce tangible dividends (11.5% by CSWC and 7.3% by MAIN) and are insulated from SaaS credit risks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this context, I would like to also insert the historical total return performance chart:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49926601-17721831774211764_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"743\" data-height=\"533\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49926601-17721831774211764_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Total returns\" width=\"640\" height=\"459\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"459\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49926601-17721831774211764_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49926601-17721831774211764_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49926601-17721831774211764_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49926601-17721831774211764_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ycharts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It really goes well in line with my thesis that MAIN and CSWC are indeed durable investment plays that have what it takes to withstand different cycles without value impairment.</p>",

BlackRock launched<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the fund in December 2007, and </span><a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/239627/ishares-msci-eafe-smallcap-etf\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">it has grown to $14 billion+ in net assets</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> — making it a dominant vehicle in the foreign small/mid-cap blend category by AUM. The fund’s benchmark is the MSCI EAFE Small Cap Index, and as a full-replication passive fund, BlackRock simply holds a proportionate share of the index constituents, rebalancing periodically in line with index changes.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After years of sluggish results, SCZ, and international equity's moment arrived. The fund posted a 32.10% NAV return in calendar year 2025, its strongest showing in recent memory, and is up approximately 9.06% year-to-date through February 23, 2026. International developed market equities have been the standout trade of the young year as investors rotate away from richly valued U.S. mega-cap growth names and toward markets with more attractive valuations and improving macro backdrops. On that front, I have no complaints about what SCZ is doing or where it invests. The issue is purely about cost — and in the passive ETF space, cost is ultimately the game.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SCZ’s benchmark, the <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/fact-sheet/scz-ishares-msci-eafe-small-cap-etf-fund-fact-sheet-en-us.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">MSCI EAFE Small Cap Index</a>, is a credible and well-constructed benchmark covering the small-cap segment of developed markets in Europe, Australasia, and the Far East. Passive investing here means the fund managers are not making active bets — they are tracking the index. But when a passive fund charges 0.40% to do something its competitors do just as well for 0.07% or 0.11%, you have to ask what you are actually paying for. I'll keep this fund as a hold - worth keeping an eye on but not the best option for international small-cap equity.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Breakdown</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SCZ was <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/fact-sheet/scz-ishares-msci-eafe-small-cap-etf-fund-fact-sheet-en-us.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">launched on December 10, 2007</a>, by BlackRock’s iShares platform.

This is a genuine differentiator — at the other end of the spectrum, actively managed foreign small-cap funds often hold 40 to 80 names, and even many passive peers hold fewer constituents. With the top 10 positions accounting for just 2.92% of total assets, no single company or sector event is going to materially impair the NAV. Morningstar recognized this quality, awarding the fund a Bronze medal rating as of April 2025. That said, the fund has struggled versus passive, cheaper indexes, and even after a strong 2025, the fund lagged the passive index by a few percent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721560896968758_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1512\" data-height=\"806\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721560896968758_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"s\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"341\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721560896968758_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721560896968758_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721560896968758_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721560896968758_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha Chart Tool</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a liquidity standpoint, SCZ is well-suited to institutional and retail investors alike, averaging approximately 1.27 million shares traded per day on NASDAQ. The fund’s scale and liquidity at $14 billion in net assets also provides tight bid-ask spreads relative to smaller ETFs in the space. I’ll acknowledge these are real attributes — and they do narrow the gap versus some cheaper but thinner alternatives. But for the vast majority of individual investors, funds like Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VSS\" title=\"Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US Small-Cap Index ETF\">VSS</a>) and Schwab International Small-Cap Equity ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHC\" title=\"Schwab International Small-Cap Equity ETF\">SCHC</a>) are both sufficiently liquid that SCZ’s liquidity premium does not justify the fee premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund employs a <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/fact-sheet/scz-ishares-msci-eafe-small-cap-etf-fund-fact-sheet-en-us.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">0.40% expense ratio</a>. For context, this is the same fee charged by many actively managed ETFs in the space, which at least have the justification of paying for a portfolio manager’s judgement. SCZ is entirely passive. When I compare it to VSS at 0.07% or SCHC at 0.11%, the math is straightforward: SCZ costs an investor roughly 29 to 33 basis points per year more, every year, for a nearly identical outcome. On a $100,000 investment compounded over 10 years, that fee gap represents roughly $3,000 to $3,500 in foregone wealth — money that stays with BlackRock rather than with you.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2026 Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The macro setup for international developed small-cap in 2026 is more constructive than it has been in years, and I want to be clear that I am bullish on the asset class — just not on SCZ specifically as the vehicle. The valuation gap between U.S. and international equities has widened to historically extreme levels over the past decade, and that gap has begun to close. A modestly weaker U.S. dollar, improving European fiscal outlooks, Japanese corporate governance reform, and better-than-expected domestic demand across the UK and Australia all support the EAFE small-cap recovery narrative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Small-cap equities in developed international markets carry a higher domestic revenue exposure than their large-cap peers, which provides meaningful insulation from cross-border tariff disruption. This is an important nuance in the current environment, where Trump tariff unpredictability has created noise around global trade flows. If you want international equity exposure that is less sensitive to U.S.-China trade tensions and more levered to local economic recovery stories, the EAFE small-cap universe is a logical place to be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, the January 2026 results were a reminder that SCZ is not always the sharpest tool even within its own category. The fund returned 5.4% in January, trailing the Foreign Small/Mid Blend category average of 6.2% for the month. Whether that is noise or a sign that VSS and SCHC’s slightly different index construction is producing better results remains to be seen, but it reinforces my view that SCZ is not even necessarily the best passive option in the space, let alone the best overall option. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Portfolio &amp; Risk Profile</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reviewing SCZ’s <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/literature/fact-sheet/scz-ishares-msci-eafe-small-cap-etf-fund-fact-sheet-en-us.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">portfolio</a> as of December 31, 2025, the sector and geographic breakdown reflect what you would expect from a broad index of developed international small caps. Industrials lead at 22.76% of the fund, followed by Financials (12.72%), Consumer Discretionary (12.27%), Real Estate (11.12%), and Materials (10.88%). Information Technology accounts for just 9.13%, which is a far cry from its dominance in U.S. benchmarks. Investors coming from an S&amp;P 500 or Nasdaq-heavy portfolio will find SCZ’s sector mix genuinely different — and that diversification benefit is real.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721562105730858_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"829\" data-height=\"637\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721562105730858_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"scz\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"492\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721562105730858_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721562105730858_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721562105730858_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56402111-17721562105730858_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SCZ Fund Facts as of Dec 31, 2025</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Geographically, Japan is the dominant weight at 35.09% of the fund, followed by the United Kingdom (12.60%), Australia (10.92%), Sweden (5.30%), and Israel (4.59%). The Japan concentration is notable and means that SCZ investors are implicitly making a significant bet on the Japanese macro story, including the Bank of Japan’s gradual monetary normalization and whether the corporate governance reform wave translates into sustained earnings improvement. This is a reasonable bet, but it is a concentrated one for a fund that markets itself on broad diversification.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a risk perspective, the fund has an <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/xnas/scz/risk\" rel=\"nofollow\">beta</a> of 1.09. The beta above 1 reflects the higher volatility though it is a portfolio diversification characteristic, not necessarily a sign that the fund is higher-risk in isolation. Additionally, the fund's 0.68 Sharpe ratio is underwhelming, as risk adjusted returns for other similar funds have been approaching 1, which is more palatable for investors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most significant fund-level risk is one I’ve already flagged: the fee. In a passive indexing context, the expense ratio is one of the only variables an investor can actually control, and paying 0.40% when comparable alternatives exist at 0.07% is a structural drag on compounded returns that never goes away. Every year you hold SCZ over VSS, you are handing back roughly 33 basis points to BlackRock for no incremental benefit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond fees, currency is the primary market-level risk. SCZ holds stocks denominated in yen, pounds, euros, Australian dollars, and Swedish krona, and USD-based investors bear this exposure in full without any hedging. A meaningful U.S. dollar strengthening — whether from tariff escalation, a hawkish Federal Reserve pivot, or a global flight to safety — would compress the fund’s USD-denominated returns even if underlying foreign stock prices were flat. This is a known and accepted feature of unhedged international ETFs, but it is a real source of short-term volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Japan’s 35% weighting is also a concentration risk that deserves mention. Any disorderly yen appreciation, JGB market volatility, or disappointment in Japan’s corporate governance reform trajectory could have an outsized impact on SCZ relative to peers with a different geographic mix. And on the macro side, tariff uncertainty, European fiscal headwinds, and the pace of global rate normalization all remain live risks for an asset class that is only just recovering its footing after years of underperformance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bottom line is that I like the asset class, but not the wrapper of SCZ. International developed small-cap equity is one of the better places to be in 2026, and SCZ’s strong 2025 performance and year-to-date gains reflect genuine fundamental improvement in the asset class rather than just momentum. The portfolio is well-diversified across 2,010 holdings, the fund is liquid, and the Morningstar Bronze rating provides some external validation of the fund’s quality.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But paying 0.40% for a passive index fund in 2026 is simply unnecessary. VSS at 0.07% and SCHC at 0.11% do the same job for a fraction of the cost, and that difference compounds into real money over a multi-year holding period. If you want international small-cap exposure — and there are good reasons to want it right now — there are more efficient vehicles to get it. For existing SCZ holders with significant embedded capital gains, holding makes sense and I am not suggesting you trigger a tax event to save 33 basis points annually. But for new money entering this asset class, I would not be starting with SCZ. I rate it a Hold.</p>",

The hotels are diversified across luxury resorts, lifestyle resorts, urban lifestyle hotels, and urban gateway hotels, with their demand mix being fairly split among leisure transient (39%), business transient (27%), and group (35%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The portfolio is also well-diversified geographically, with Boston, Chicago, and New York City representing the largest market concentration at 13.3%, 12.5%, and 8.2% of EBITDA respectively.

This structure provides the company with greater control over expenses, capital expenditures, and cash flow. With contracts being short-term and terminable at will, there is significant flexibility to quickly test and implement profit-enhancing technologies, and decisions can be made specifically for each hotel's unique needs. In fact, the company’s third-party managed properties have consistently outperformed its brand-managed properties.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719974117358372_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"657\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719974117358372_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://investor.drhc.com/static-files/6b1cf418-fbe0-4508-a63d-00a189f1558b\" width=\"640\" height=\"447\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719974117358372_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719974117358372_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719974117358372_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719974117358372_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DRH Dec'25 Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance Sheet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In July 2025, the company successfully refinanced its senior unsecured credit facility, increasing it from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. The company used this additional amount to repay the existing mortgage loans secured by 2 of its properties. Subsequent to the repayment, and as of Q4 2025, the company’s total debt stands at $1.1 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.98%. This debt is comprised entirely of unsecured term loans, with the earliest maturity coming in January 2028, almost 2 years later. All debt is prepayable at any time without penalty, and the floating rate nature of the debt means the company stands to benefit from a declining rate environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719991238723252_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"659\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719991238723252_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://investor.drhc.com/static-files/6b1cf418-fbe0-4508-a63d-00a189f1558b\" width=\"640\" height=\"449\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719991238723252_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719991238723252_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719991238723252_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/48026918-17719991238723252_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DRH Dec'25 Investor Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of Q4 2025, the company has liquidity of approximately $468 million, comprising $68.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $400 million from its undrawn revolving credit facility. This, coupled with the relatively long duration till its next maturity, means the company has substantial available capital to deploy strategically, or even for emergencies. Its portfolio is also fully unencumbered by secured debt, which does provide an additional option for the company to raise funds if necessary. The company has a net debt + preferred to EBITDA of approximately 3.5x, marking it on the lower end compared to its peers in the same space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One example of the flexibility the company has due to its strong balance sheet came in December 2025, when the company <a href=\"https://investor.drhc.com/static-files/d79bd41c-5cd8-4604-9d27-48f3e2491ac8\" rel=\"nofollow\">redeemed all 4.76 million shares</a> of its 8.250% Series A Preferred Stock for approximately $121.5 million cash on hand. This eliminates approximately $9.8 million in annual preferred dividends, and positively impacts the company’s Funds From Operations (FFO) by approximately $0.03/share. In all, this move has improved the company’s cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Dividends</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For 2025, DiamondRock Hospitality Company declared a <a href=\"https://investor.drhc.com/static-files/02e96b2b-394e-4b15-957d-6bce61e1a7ce\" rel=\"nofollow\">total dividend of $0.36/share</a>, comprising quarterly dividends of $0.08/share and a stub dividend of $0.04/share. The total dividend of $0.36/share represents a 12.5% increase over 2024. The company also stated that it expects to increase its quarterly dividend to $0.09/share for 2026, and possibly pay a stub dividend in Q4 2026 as well. Even excluding the stub dividend, this represents yet another 12.5% increase in the regular dividend, and gives the company a forward dividend yield of 3.6% at minimum (based on the current share price of $10/share).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A quick glance at the company’s Adjusted Funds From Operations (<span>AFFO</span>) shows that this current dividend is sustainable. AFFO for the year came in at $1.08/share, triple the total dividend of $0.36/share paid. Moreover, management has also indicated that the company will continue growing its dividends over the next few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/48026918-1772280483980978_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"741\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/48026918-1772280483980978_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://investor.drhc.com/static-files/aa83aff2-1fd1-4bf4-8f4e-b3c0b7b2a4e5\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"505\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/48026918-1772280483980978_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/48026918-1772280483980978_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/48026918-1772280483980978_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/48026918-1772280483980978_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DRH Q4'25 Earnings Release</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DiamondRock Hospitality Company is currently trading at approximately $10/share, significantly higher than its 52-week low of approximately $6.19/share, reflecting the market’s confidence in the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A look at the price targets from other analysts indicates that the company is currently fairly valued, with the average price target at $10.23/share, only slightly higher than the present value.

The company has meaningful EBITDA exposure to several host and surrounding markets, such as Boston, Florida, and New York City. Hotel bookings in the host cities have surged, which bodes well for the company’s 2026 performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apart from the World Cup, one of the most compelling advantages the company has is that there is negligible new supply affecting its portfolio. 29 of its 36 hotels have no competitive submarket supply under construction, with supply constraints expected to persist for several years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Potential Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As always, there are potential risks to consider. Firstly, macroeconomic sensitivity. As a hospitality REIT, the company’s performance is tied to economic conditions. There have been declines in leisure transient travel and international travel to the country, in part due to the current political and economic environment, including tariff-related uncertainty. Any recession or significant decline in consumer confidence would inevitably have a negative impact on the company’s performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk comes in the form of interest rate risk. With the bulk of the company’s debt being floating rate (70%, net of swaps), the company faces a substantial increase in interest expense should there be a rise in rates. For example, a 100 basis point increase would add approximately $7.7 million in annual interest expense, almost wiping out the savings from eliminating its preferred stock dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One last risk to consider would be that of valuation. As indicated above, the company is currently either fairly valued or slightly undervalued, with consensus price targets coming in around the company’s current share price. Moreover, the stock’s recovery from its low of $6.19/share means most of the near-term upside has been captured, and there is less margin for error.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DiamondRock Hospitality Company has a strengthened and fully unencumbered balance sheet, as well as a supply-insulated portfolio of hotels. Management has consistently sought (and succeeded) to increase free cash flow per share, and they have returned capital to shareholders in the form of increased dividends. While the stock is likely fairly valued at present, it represents a quality holding, and I rate it a “Buy.”</p>",

Based on the recent information, around 40% of private credit loans are extended to software companies, which are currently being disrupted by advanced AI tools. Thus, according to UBS, the default rate could be as high as 15% on these loans. Most importantly, large banks are heavily exposed because they lend to these private credit funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the bust in private credit is not sufficiently large to cause a systemic credit shock and the crisis like 2008 GFC - unless the labor market weakens. In this situation, a spike in the unemployment rate could burst the housing market bubble, the CRE bubble, and increase consumer loan defaults, which would likely trigger a financial crisis comparable to 2008.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, a stable labor market is now crucial in preventing contagion from the private credit crisis to the rest of the economy. The key issue here is whether AI adoption will cause massive layoffs - and the February labor market report could give us some clues.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Leading indicators for February</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The leading indicators for February point to a sluggish job creation, but still a tight labor market, consistent with consensus expectations. Thus, I don't expect any major surprises.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.pmi.spglobal.com/Public/Home/PressRelease/de7251a734954460986e49e0ab041b2f\" rel=\"nofollow\">The S&amp;P Global US Flash PMI</a> for February points to some weaknesses, which could be weather related. For service jobs, the report states:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Sluggish sales growth and concerns over rising costs led to a further month of very modest employment growth, albeit with some companies also reporting difficulties finding staff.

Over the last 12 months, virtually all jobs have been created in Private Education and Health Services, with some in Leisure &amp; Hospitality. However, over the last 3 months there have been 65K jobs created in construction, and 105K jobs created in business and professional services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note, President Trump referenced 70K construction jobs created in his State of the Union address. I fact-checked it, and it's (nearly) true.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The first phase of Trump's plan is construction of factories, which will be evident in new construction jobs created - while the second phase is creation of manufacturing jobs (once the factories are constructed).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/741147-17722139322146401_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"724\" data-height=\"633\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/741147-17722139322146401_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Jobs\" width=\"640\" height=\"560\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/741147-17722139322146401_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/741147-17722139322146401_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/741147-17722139322146401_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/741147-17722139322146401_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>BLS</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's also interesting is the creation of 105K jobs in business and professional and business services, where 30K new jobs have been created in Temporary Help services, as the chart below shows.

We have a new Fed Chair starting in May, and Goldman Sachs global head of investment grade credit, Jonny Fine, is calling for 4 rate cuts this year. I happen to agree, especially with more layoffs occurring. The Fed will need to cut to make it more viable for smaller businesses to expand and entrepreneurs to operate. In a yield-starved environment, high-yield funds will look more attractive, and SPYI has established a track record that is hard to ignore.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that NEOS Investments has done an incredible job generating value for shareholders and establishing a track record that works. The reality is that since inception, SPYI has delivered $20.99 in income, which is an average annualized yield of 12.21%, while appreciating by over 6%. If you're looking for income in a yield-starved environment, SPYI should continue to deliver double-digit income while gradually appreciating with the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561384492338_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"867\" data-height=\"324\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561384492338_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SPYI\" width=\"640\" height=\"239\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561384492338_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561384492338_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561384492338_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561384492338_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Following Up on My Previous Article about SPYI</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in October I had written an article on SPYI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4832929-spyi-etf-remains-attractive-in-yield-starved-environment\">can be read here</a>) where I discussed how SPYI was still attractive as the risk-free rate of return continued to decline. I felt that SPYI stood out for its blend of appreciation and income, as its two-leg option strategy allowed it to operate in any environment. 2025 is in the books, and SPYI delivered another successful year. I am following up with another article on SPYI as I believe we will see a shift of capital from risk-free assets to income producing ETFs and CEFs to recreate the amount of income that was being produced when rates were over 5%. As that happens, I think that covered call ETFs will become more popular than they are and that SPYI can gain a significant amount of AUM. I am still very bullish on the market in 2026 and believe that SPYI is a great ETF if you're looking to produce double digit yields while having some exposure to potential upside appreciation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561384961972_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"878\" data-height=\"245\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561384961972_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SPYI\" width=\"640\" height=\"179\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561384961972_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561384961972_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561384961972_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561384961972_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>SPYI Has Established a Strong Track Record over the Past 3 ½ Years that Could Continue</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors that are focused on income are not necessarily looking for large amounts of capital appreciation; otherwise, they would just be plowing this capital into index funds or individual equities. Unless you have a misunderstanding of what covered call ETFs do, the people adding capital towards SPYI are looking for reliable recurring income. Since inception, SPYI has generated 42 consecutive monthly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYI/dividends/history\">distributions</a> to the tune of $20.99. This is an average monthly distribution of $0.50 which is a monthly yield of 0.96%. It’s hard to find an investment that can throw off a stable monthly yield of around 1%, and after 42 months, SPYI’s track record is solid in my opinion. There are limited fluctuations in the monthly distribution, and SPYI has been able to establish an average monthly distribution of around 12.21%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561384482_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1300\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561384482_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SPYI Distribution\" width=\"640\" height=\"222\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561384482_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561384482_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561384482_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561384482_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Long-term investors were able to buy shares of SPYI at inception for $49.13 so on a $10,000 investment, 203.54 shares could have been purchased. If the distribution income was taken as cash and not reinvested back into SPYI there would have been $4,273.11 in distribution income generated. This is a 42.73% yield on cost or 12.21% annualized. Shares of SPYI are also up 6.13% since inception, which is a total return of 48.86% in 3 ½ years. Investors have been able to generate $4,885.77 of total return from SPYI. If that same $10,000 was invested in the $12 million in August of 2022 you would have generated 3.32% on your $10,000 which is $332 in income. If this was rolled over each year on an annualized basis, the total income would be roughly $1,702 and your capital would still be locked up for another 6 months. There is also no upside appreciation. The track record that SPYI has established is very strong, and I think now that the risk-free rate of return is trending towards the 3% level, it’s going to be very hard for investors to lock up capital for at least a year for low single digit yields.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561385071867_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"893\" data-height=\"599\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561385071867_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"U.S. 12 month bond\" width=\"640\" height=\"429\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561385071867_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561385071867_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561385071867_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721561385071867_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>I am a Big Fan of SPYI’s Framework and Tax Structure</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://neosfunds.com/spyi/#fund-material\" rel=\"nofollow\">SPYI</a> is an actively managed ETF that has a main goal of generating high monthly income in a tax efficient manner with the potential for equity appreciation if the markets move higher. From a mechanics standpoint, SPYI owns the companies found in the S&amp;P 500 and then runs a call options strategy on the S&amp;P 500 Index, which includes written calls for income and purchased long calls for appreciation. Many income ETFs overwrite the portfolio by selling calls and sacrificing a lot of upside. Within the <a href=\"https://neosfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/SPYI-Prospectus.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">prospectus,</a> it is clear that SPYI will leverage two sets of options to protect shareholders. SPYI will sell SPX calls on up to 100% of the equity value to harvest premium and then use part of that premium to buy out-of-the-money SPX calls. The purchased calls allow SPYI to move higher with the market to a degree because they will uncap the sold calls they wrote to generate income. This strategy allows SPYI to not lose all of the upside potential (though structurally it will lose some).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SPYI uses SPX index options that can qualify as Section 1256 contracts, which are generally treated as 60% long-term and 40% short-term capital gains, regardless of holding period. Although, it's good to note that the tax character of distributions can differ, and often is Return of Capital, which lowers investors' cost basis. SPYI also indicated that it may seek to harvest losses in equity and/or options positions to offset realized taxable gains. This is positive for long-term investors in SPYI looking for income because this framework can improve after-tax outcomes versus structures that tend to generate predominantly short-term income. Compared to other strategies, if you are holding SPYI in a taxable account, there could be significant benefits to SPYI from a tax perspective. Investors can read through the prospectus and ask an accountant for further information on this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721562754764953_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1297\" data-height=\"540\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721562754764953_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Benefits of Option based ETFs\" width=\"640\" height=\"266\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721562754764953_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721562754764953_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721562754764953_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721562754764953_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>NEOS Investments</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even when we’re in a bull market, there are periods of volatility, which tend to spike around macro data, Fed pivots, elections, geopolitics, earnings seasons, and liquidity events. I believe that SPYI is built to monetize that volatility through systematic index option writing, and if the market declines, the structure of owning out-of-the-money calls allows it to rebound over time. ETFs that are overwriting the profile tend to cap most, if not all, of the upside potential, and when the market swings to the downside, it makes it very difficult for that fund to rebound. SPYI has allowed investors to stay in the game while generating double-digit yields on a recurring basis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How SPYI’s Upside Capture, Downside Exposure, and NAV Drag Could Look</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most important thing to understand about SPYI’s relative performance versus the S&amp;P 500 is that it doesn’t overwrite and cap all of the upside potential. SPYI owns the positions within the S&amp;P 500 and then overlays index options by selling SPX calls to generate the monthly distribution and buy out of the money call options. The two-leg approach allows upside capture in SPYI. Since SPYI is taking in a net credit from the option overlay, SPYI tends to act differently within different cycles. In a modest bull market where the market rises but finishes below the short-call strike at expiration, the calls can expire worthless and the fund keeps the premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When this happens, investors are getting both equity upside in addition to the option premium, which allows SPYI to keep pace with the index on a total return basis. In the event of a strong rally that pushes through the short calls strike, SPYI is effectively selling away part of the upside for the immediate income. This is the core trade-off for monetizing volatility, as some of the future upside is converted into immediate income while no appreciation is realized until the long calls kick in. In a melt up situation where there is outsized upside, SPYI’s structure allows them to benefit from the long calls. The long calls begin to offset the short calls after the index moves beyond the long-call strike, which negates SPYI’s upside being permanently capped at the short strike.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When markets are declining, SPYI should be looked at as equity risk first and the option overlay second. SPYI owns the positions within the S&amp;P 500 so if the index sells off, SPYI will follow. There is no downside protection built in from puts. The short-call premium can provide a limited cushion, but it is not comparable to the structural protection of owning protective puts. When the market has a mild downturn, the premium harvested can reduce the drawdown and help stabilize total returns, but in events like Liberation Day, when the move to the downside is violent, the premium collected is usually not large enough to offset the equity losses. When net asset value (NAV) drag gets discussed, many assume it means that SPYI is bleeding value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are two different concepts with NAV drag that include mechanical NAV drop from paying the distributions and the structural drag from the strategy. When SPYI pays the distribution, the NAV typically drops by roughly the distribution amount on the ex-date. This is a transfer of value from NAV into cash, and the metric to look at is total return, not the price to NAV. In a structural drag situation, the fund could underperform the index over a period of time. By trading away some upside in exchange for premium, SPYI is intentionally spending a portion of the premium to buy out-of-the-money calls. If the market doesn’t rally enough for those calls to come in the money, the premium outlay can impact the total return. SPYI is likely to work best for shareholders when the markets are range-bound to moderately bullish, and investors should expect equity equivalent drawdowns with a modest cushion from the premium when the markets fall.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks to Investing in SPYI</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I am bullish on SPYI, there are several risk factors to consider. SPYI has capped a lot of the upside by selling calls, and while purchasing the long calls helps, it only uncaps a portion of the potential. If the markets experience a bull market, SPYI is likely to underperform a traditional index fund. While SPYI’s distribution has been stable, the option income could change if there is less volatility in the market. Investors should make sure they understand what they are signing up for with SPYI because this fund is geared towards income, not capital appreciation. Everyone should do their own due diligence, and if you're not looking for income, SPYI is probably not the right investment for you.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that SPYI is a strong candidate for investors who want S&amp;P 500 exposure but also want to generate large amounts of recurring income by converting volatility into monthly distributions. SPYI is designed to give investors a chance at producing both income and appreciation, unlike traditional covered call ETFs. For investors looking for large amounts of monthly cash flow, I am a big fan of SPYI’s structure, as the monthly distributions are yielding close to 1%. As the risk-free rate of return declines, I think more investors will look toward SPYI to generate income, and I am bullish on its future potential.</p>",

The legacy generic products continue to face intense \"competitive pressure.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The kicker is revenue growth deceleration from branded products like BAQSIMI and Primatene MIST. In the US market, management will forgo a price increase this year, which signals that they are simply trying to steady BAQSIMI's volume. Management plans to pull BAQSIMI from certain international markets where it is unprofitable. When Amphastar acquired BAQSIMI from Eli Lilly (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY\" title=\"Eli Lilly and Company\">LLY</a>), there was a 3-year mandate to support <em>all</em> markets. This mandate ends in July 2026. Until then, Amphastar is tasked with marketing BAQSIMI in unprofitable regions-negatively impacting its margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It sounds counterintuitive, but Amphastar's generic business was actually more profitable than its branded business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Compare glucagon and BAQSIMI:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722204577163608_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2700\" data-height=\"1962\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722204577163608_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" width=\"640\" height=\"465\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722204577163608_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722204577163608_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722204577163608_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722204577163608_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author's Compilation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So these product mix trends (BAQSIMI takes up a growing portion of total revenues) have been negatively impacting Amphastar's margins as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before late 2024, Amphastar's gross margins were consistently &gt;50%. Then, of course, there are R&amp;D and SG&amp;A costs, which have had to ramp up due to pipeline investments and legal expenses, respectively. All of this together resulted in a 36% decrease in GAAP net income in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-1772220423280469_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2700\" data-height=\"1140\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-1772220423280469_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" width=\"640\" height=\"270\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-1772220423280469_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-1772220423280469_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-1772220423280469_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-1772220423280469_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Sourced from AMPH PR dated 02/26/26 (Author's Compilation)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, these are all necessary pains required for Amphastar to evolve. So-so long as Amphastar is in a good place financially-the market's focus should be on the road ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the call, management clarified that the difference between \"mid\" and \"high\" single-digit growth in 2026 was pinned on AMP-007 (generic ipratropium). But as I talked about in December, AMP-007's best-case scenario (assuming no Authorized Generic joins the market) is a \"short burst in revenues.\" The asset is not expected to be a major contributor beyond 2026/2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you're looking for long-term major contributors for Amphastar, you have to direct your attention to its preclinical pipeline (acquired from Nanjing Anji last year). However, management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875977-amphastar-pharmaceuticals-inc-amph-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">admitted</a> that they haven't even spoken to the FDA yet regarding AMP-110 (AMP-105, 107, 109, 110 are all proprietary pipeline programs).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And the big catalysts (a GLP-1 and insulin aspart) are not expected <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875977-amphastar-pharmaceuticals-inc-amph-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">until 2027</a>-leaving investors with not much to chew on until then besides stabilizing gross margins, increasing opex, an uncertain AMP-007 launch, and mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Assumptions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On many metrics, AMPH screens \"undervalued.\" On P/E GAAP (forward), AMPH's 7.85 trades at a ~58% discount to its sector peers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I play with my discounted cash flow model, I am mainly interested in finding out what AMPH is priced for, and then questioning how reasonable the implied growth/margin assumptions are.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For a company like Amphastar-that is transitioning from predictable generic products to novel drug development-it would likely not be wise to assume that it'll maintain its free cash flow margins of the past (~17% in the TTM). So, I modeled for 10% free cash flow margins and mid-single-digit growth (5%). These really represent averages over the nine-year projection period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722473582012587_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2420\" data-height=\"1702\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722473582012587_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" width=\"640\" height=\"450\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722473582012587_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722473582012587_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722473582012587_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722473582012587_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author's Compilation</p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722473729257233_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2430\" data-height=\"892\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722473729257233_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" width=\"640\" height=\"235\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722473729257233_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722473729257233_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722473729257233_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722473729257233_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author's Compilation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, single-point estimates can be a bit misleading.

It is no surprise that the top holdings in the portfolio consist of Mag-7 companies, given that the ETF concept involves tracking the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nasdaq\" htloopnumber=\"799632737\">Nasdaq</em>-100 index. There are 103 holdings in the portfolio, and the concentration is quite high, since the top 10 assets account for 48.83%. By tracking the index, this fund smooths out portfolio results but makes it impossible to get alpha from the growth of individual stocks.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/62917110-17722215632078629_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"145\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/62917110-17722215632078629_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Holdings Breakdown of QQQI\" width=\"640\" height=\"92\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/62917110-17722215632078629_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/62917110-17722215632078629_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/62917110-17722215632078629_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/62917110-17722215632078629_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Holdings Breakdown of QQQI</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the dividend yield is in the double digits at 14.30%, those managing QQQI are effectively balancing payouts and capital preservation, allowing for dividend yields without sacrificing capital growth. These payments are generated through an option strategy that uses index spreads (options are based on the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nasdaq\" htloopnumber=\"799632737\">Nasdaq</em>-100 index rather than individual stocks). The mechanism of managing the option strategy QQQI involves a one-time sale of options and the use of a call spread, in which long call options are purchased in addition to the options already written. As a result, you get a profit from the net credit spread, the difference between the premium from selling call options and the cost of buying long call options on the out-of-the-money index.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I should also add that the QQQI option strategy (as with most of the NEOS family of ETFs) can generate payouts that are mostly in the form of return of capital. This means these payouts aren't considered income and aren't subject to immediate taxation, as well as reducing the cost basis when selling the ETF. Profits from QQQI fall under Section 1256, rendering it tax-efficient, since the premium is automatically classified on a 60/40 basis, where 60% of the income is taxed as long-term capital gains and 40% as short-term capital gains. <a href=\"https://neosfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/QQQI-Form-8937-5.31.25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://neosfunds.com/wp-content/uploads/QQQI-Form-8937-5.31.25.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">In accordance with Form 8937</a>, between January 2025 and June 2025, RoC accounted for 98.85% of all QQQI distributions, up from 94.45% between July 2024 and December 2024. The percentage of RoC distributions is influenced by the fact that it may indicate a decline in NAV over time; therefore, the high monthly RoC distributions should be viewed in relation to NAV dynamics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown in the chart below, it is clear that QQQI is not an ETF that depletes capital. By way of example, an investor who <a href=\"https://neosfunds.com/qqqi/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://neosfunds.com/qqqi/\" target=\"_blank\">invested $10,000 when the fund launched on January 29, 2024, has earned $4,307</a>, compared to a return of only $3,240, or 24.8%, for an investment in the benchmark <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nasdaq\" htloopnumber=\"799632737\">Nasdaq</em>-100 Index. Taking into account the fund's <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"two\" htloopnumber=\"799632737\">two</em> years of operation, that means the QQQI's return is on average 12.4% higher than the return from the benchmark. With capital erosion, you'd see QQQI's total return fall below the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nasdaq\" htloopnumber=\"799632737\">Nasdaq</em>-100's return over time. That said, this fund's been around for <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"two\" htloopnumber=\"799632737\">two</em> full years, so it's been around long enough to be considered a decent comparison to other option funds in the ETF market. That said, it's still too early to tell how QQQI will hold up over time, because it hasn't faced any major market downturns, for example, the pandemic. This means we don't have all the proof that the fund managers can keep the capital and overall returns going if the market goes into a serious bear market.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/62917110-17722218447492375_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"491\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/62917110-17722218447492375_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Growth of $10,000 at NAV Since Inception\" width=\"640\" height=\"313\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/62917110-17722218447492375_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/62917110-17722218447492375_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/62917110-17722218447492375_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/62917110-17722218447492375_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Growth of $10,000 at NAV Since Inception</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I suggest comparing QQQI with a passive fund, such as Invesco QQQ Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 ETF\">QQQ</a>), in order to definitively determine the effectiveness of investing in QQQI. I took their total returns from January 29, 2024 (since QQQI was launched). In this period, total returns for QQQ were 1.79% higher than for QQQI. My view is that QQQ's results are higher during a bull market, and when the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nasdaq\" htloopnumber=\"799632737\">Nasdaq</em>-100 moves into a sideways or bearish trend, it is likely that QQQI's actual results will be higher. Even though QQQI's net asset value will follow QQQ in the event of such a decline, its total return will be mitigated by the premium income received. In addition, it is worth considering when evaluating the effectiveness of investing in QQQI that this total return is mainly generated from dividend payments, a large part of which are paid in the form of RoC. For QQQ, overall returns are generated by capital growth. This means that when you factor in taxes on capital gains and dividends, you'll find that QQQI's real performance is way higher.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/62917110-17722219581688113_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"325\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/62917110-17722219581688113_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Total Return\" width=\"640\" height=\"207\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/62917110-17722219581688113_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/62917110-17722219581688113_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/62917110-17722219581688113_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/62917110-17722219581688113_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Total Return</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI cycle stress test</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874614-the-fed-is-bracing-for-an-ai-bubble-burst-and-global-stagflation\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874614-the-fed-is-bracing-for-an-ai-bubble-burst-and-global-stagflation\" target=\"_blank\">Stress test results from the Federal Reserve for 2026 are alarming</a>, since the worst-case scenario assumes a 54% stock market crash, mainly due to a crisis in the AI industry.

Furthermore, the volume of CDSs purchased by investors to hedge against such risks has increased to $10 billion (<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"four\" htloopnumber=\"799632737\">four</em> times in one year).

Nevertheless, one should bear in mind that the primary source of CAPEX financing is not profit, but long-term debt. Companies included in the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nasdaq\" htloopnumber=\"799632737\">Nasdaq</em>-100 are increasing their credit leverage themselves, driven by the strategic need to quickly enter new AI sub-sectors. 2026 will see a continuation of the boom, with no room for a slow entry, since any delay in scaling up will result in the market being divided among investors who have invested more in development in a few years' time. It is precisely for this reason that the management of the largest IT giants continues to opt for increasing debt to finance CAPEX, and does not seek ways to optimize through self-financing. Even though the market is still wondering what the return on AI investments will be, because the infrastructure is being built today and the real ROI won't be known for a few years, the negative scenario will still take time to happen. For now, as the market momentum remains bullish, because monetization is beginning and margins remain unchanged, continue to bet on QQQI, the double-digit return of which now outweighs the potential risks from the uncertainty surrounding the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nasdaq\" htloopnumber=\"799632737\">Nasdaq</em>-100.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks of the investment thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investing in QQQI is still risky because it hasn't been tested in a really bearish market. For example, if the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nasdaq\" htloopnumber=\"799632737\">Nasdaq</em>-100 drops more than 20-30% over 6-12 months, it's not clear how the fund's capital will hold up. This is because, under such circumstances, any premium generated by the option strategy is unlikely to cover more than half of the drawdown. In addition, it is precisely in such cases that further income generated may be reduced due to capital erosion, because the fund will have less capital to work with. Correspondingly, NAV decline could lead to even greater risks for investments in QQQI, thereby making it a less reliable ETF. One exception to this negative scenario could be that the bear market causes growth and market volatility, on which the size of the potential premium from selling options depends. Under such circumstances, profits generated from the option strategy may increase, improving the situation with NAV recovery. I would like to caution, though, in the event of a <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nasdaq\" htloopnumber=\"799632737\">Nasdaq</em>-100 reversal, the QQQI will definitely not be considered a hedging instrument against its decline, so it may be worth considering other assets.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, even though analysts and economists are talking about more risks, it's still my opinion that the market won't crash in 2026 thanks to the massive CAPEX that's keeping the AI supercycle going. That is why I believe QQQI remains an attractive investment fund that targets double-digit dividend yields and offers tax optimization benefits. Nevertheless, from a long-term perspective, investors should exercise greater caution when maintaining income-oriented assets in their portfolios that are highly correlated with the performance of the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nasdaq\" htloopnumber=\"799632737\">Nasdaq</em>-100 and Mag-7 stocks individually. That's why, should we encounter real data confirming unjustified demand for AI products and ROI from investments in data centers and network infrastructure, we'll be prepared to optimize the portfolio, which will most likely exclude ETFs such as QQQI.</p>",

Being humble about your mistakes is how you learn and grow. A great<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> example of this involving myself relates to my </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4499516-cal-maine-foods-stock-showing-promise-shares-look-overpriced\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">decision</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">, back in April of 2022, to rate </span><strong class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cal-Maine Foods</strong><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CALM\" title=\"Cal-Maine Foods, Inc.\">CALM</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) a 'sell.' Leading up to that point, declining sales, profits, and cash flows, had dominated the financial narrative. Admittedly, the company was low risk because of its strong balance sheet. But the stock looked drastically overpriced. I underestimated, quite frankly, just what would happen in the egg market that the company operates in. I did not foresee prices skyrocketing because of industry supply constraints. That ultimately pushed revenue, profits, and cash flows, drastically higher. And as a result, the company's stock price has risen 81.9% at a time when the S&amp;P 500 is up only 50.2%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was one of the biggest misses that I have had in the last couple of years. Looking at the picture today, I see a company that is continuing to benefit from elevated prices. But make no mistake that these price increases are likely temporary. Data from the USDA suggests that prices will drop throughout 2026. And in fact, for the 2026 fiscal year for the company, we have already seen a deleterious impact on the bottom line as a result. Having said that, the stock is incredibly cheap right now. And its balance sheet is remarkably robust. I wouldn't go so far as to upgrade the stock to a 'buy' because of worries over declining prices. But I do think that rating it a very solid 'hold' makes sense here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The picture is better than I thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some companies in the food industry are incredibly diverse from an <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/16160/000156276225000170/calm2025053110K.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">operational standpoint</a>. And others, such as Cal-Maine Foods, are much more concentrated. The company prides itself on being the largest producer and distributor of shell eggs in the US. Its operations consist of hatching chicks, growing and maintaining flocks of pullets, dealing with layers and breeders, producing feed, and ultimately producing and distributing eggs. The company is massive in this industry. According to management, the fleet as of the end of the most recent quarter consisted of 11.4 million pullets and breeders, as well as 49.3 million layers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892558618522_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2258\" data-height=\"868\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892558618522_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"246\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"246\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892558618522_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892558618522_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892558618522_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892558618522_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author - SEC EDGAR Data</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the last few years, financial performance for the business has been admittedly mixed.

You see, the vast majority of the company's revenue, approximately 85% for the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/16160/000156276226000004/calm-20251129.htm#a6234\" rel=\"nofollow\">first half of 2026</a>, came specifically from the sale of shell eggs. Normally when you see rapid revenue growth like what was experienced over the last couple of years, it's because of continued investments aimed at boosting output. Yes, the company has achieved some expansion on that front. From 2023 through 2025, the firm went from selling 1.15 billion dozens of eggs to selling 1.28 billion dozens of eggs. And for the first half of 2026, the 640.2 million dozens of eggs produced by the company exceeded the 639.8 million dozen reported the previous year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289347815117_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2026\" data-height=\"884\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289347815117_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"279\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"279\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289347815117_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289347815117_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289347815117_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289347815117_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author - SEC EDGAR Data</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bigger expansion for the company came from a hike in average prices for shell eggs. Back in 2023, prices averaged $2.62 per dozen. That dropped to $1.93 in 2024 before surging to $3.13 last year. Unfortunately, an outbreak of bird flu drastically slashed supplies of layers in the space. According to one source, since 2022, tens of millions of commercial egg layers have been impacted. This naturally caused a decline in overall supply, while demand remained robust. After all, eggs still remain a major source of protein at an affordable price. So when alternative options are still more expensive, demand remains resilient. We have started to see prices decline. In the first half of the 2026 fiscal year, they dropped to $2.25 per dozen. That's down from the $2.57 per dozen reported a year earlier.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company also continues to benefit from expansion elsewhere. Even though the production and sale of shell eggs represents the main source of revenue growth for the company, it is investing heavily into the egg products and prepared foods markets. Examples here include hard-cooked eggs, egg wraps, protein pancakes, crepes, and wrap-ups. In that vein, in September of 2024, the company made an investment in Crepini LLC, essentially establishing a new egg products and prepared foods joint venture. And in the 2025 fiscal year, the business acquired Echo Lake Foods in a deal valued at $258 million. That business, based out of Wisconsin, produces, packages, markets, and distributes, prepared foods such as waffles, pancakes, scrambled eggs, frozen cooked omelets, egg patties, toast, and diced eggs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892730805206_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2050\" data-height=\"866\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892730805206_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"270\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"270\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892730805206_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892730805206_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892730805206_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892730805206_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author - SEC EDGAR Data</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These activities have helped to boost revenue for the prepared foods and egg products spaces as of late. Prior to the 2026 fiscal year, management never broke out these two separate categories. In the chart above, you can see expansion in revenue for them combined over the last two fiscal years. And in the chart below, you can see revenue figures for them when it comes to the first half of 2026 compared to the first half of 2025. Although this is great to see, it's not going to represent the largest portion of the company and its health. A lot will still depend on shell egg production and prices associated with them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892839201732_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1980\" data-height=\"876\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892839201732_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"283\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"283\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892839201732_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892839201732_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892839201732_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712892839201732_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author - SEC EDGAR Data</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we project out results for the company based on what was seen in the first half of 2026, we would expect net profits for the fiscal year to be around $998.8 million. Adjusted operating cash flow would be $1.25 billion, while EBITDA would amount to $1.38 billion. Using these estimates, and also the results that the company achieved for the 2025 fiscal year, we can see in the chart below how the stock is priced at the moment. Honestly, these are incredibly low multiples. And compared to other companies that are in the food space, which the chart below illustrates, the stock is definitely the cheapest of the group. Add on top of this the fact that it has a net cash position of $1.14 billion compared to a market capitalization of only $3.96 billion, and we are looking at an incredibly healthy company trading on the cheap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289327995313_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2042\" data-height=\"878\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289327995313_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"275\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"275\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289327995313_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289327995313_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289327995313_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-1771289327995313_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author - SEC EDGAR Data</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Normally in cases like this, I would be incredibly bullish. In fact, I would typically be buying the stock hand over fist. However, I am concerned about prices moving forward. After seeing table eggs drop from 7.74 billion pounds in 2024 to 7.37 billion pounds in 2025, which would be a decline of 4.8% year over year, it's expected, according to the <a href=\"https://ers.usda.gov/sites/default/files/_laserfiche/outlooks/113689/LDP-M-379.pdf?v=99499\" rel=\"nofollow\">USDA</a>, for overall egg production to shoot up to 7.90 billion pounds in the US this year. Prices are forecasted to fall drastically.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712894525809395_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2756\" data-height=\"1002\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712894525809395_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Eggs\" width=\"640\" height=\"233\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"233\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712894525809395_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712894525809395_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712894525809395_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712894525809395_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">USDA</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Grade A large eggs, for instance, should see prices drop from $3.74 per dozen last year to $1.20 per dozen this year. That will absolutely have an impact on the bottom line results for the company and likely means that the valuation data that I applied for 2026 is higher than what will ultimately be achieved. Of course, even if profits and cash flows are cut by half, we are still looking at a company that is attractively priced. But because of the uncertainty that exists here, I think a more cautious approach to valuing the company is warranted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712893621353004_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2544\" data-height=\"1416\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712893621353004_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"356\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"356\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712893621353004_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712893621353004_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712893621353004_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712893621353004_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cal-Maine Foods</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One thing that will work in the company's favor as time goes on is that management continues to make <a href=\"https://irp.cdn-website.com/79e86203/files/uploaded/CALM+FY26Q2+-+Earnings+Call+Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">investments</a> in transforming the operation. I already talked about its move into the egg products and prepared foods space. But that's not all. Within the shell egg category, for instance, the company continues to transition away from conventional eggs and towards specialty ones. In the second quarter of 2026, 44% of shell egg sales were specialty eggs. That's up from 32% a year earlier. This is important because, in addition to experiencing higher demand, specialty eggs also demand higher prices. Take the second quarter of the 2026 fiscal year as an example. During that quarter, conventional shell egg prices averaged $1.80 per dozen. That was down drastically from the $2.94 per dozen reported the previous year. But year over year, specialty egg prices dropped only slightly from $2.39 per dozen to $2.37 per dozen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management is making organic investments into the prepared foods side of the business also. In fact, the company recently launched a $15 million network optimization and capacity expansion project aimed at adding 17 million pounds annually of scrambled eggs production by the middle of the 2027 fiscal year. And on top of this, it's also investing $14.8 million into its high-speed pancake line. If everything goes according to plan, this should boost capacity for that product line by 12 million pounds through early fiscal 2027. When you add on top of this the fact that the aforementioned joint venture, Crepini Foods, will see the company invest $7 million through the 2028 fiscal year to add 18 million pounds of capacity, we are looking at significant capacity growth over the next couple of years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712894007856417_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2554\" data-height=\"1426\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712894007856417_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"357\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"357\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712894007856417_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712894007856417_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712894007856417_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/9866571-17712894007856417_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cal-Maine Foods</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management also continues to focus on returning capital to shareholders. In fact, the company is currently paying out about a third of all net profits to the investor base in the form of dividends. The company also has a $500 million share buyback program in place. And in the first half of the 2026 fiscal year, the company bought back 846,037 shares in exchange for $74.8 million. That leaves $375.2 million remaining under its buyback initiative.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on all the data provided, I must say that I am definitely intrigued by Cal-Maine Foods right now. The company is certainly a high-quality business with very little in the way of solvency or liquidity risk. In fact, it is remarkably stable. I like seeing the investments being made by management. Diversifying away from conventional eggs is certainly a wise idea, especially considering their commoditized nature and volatility. Because of how cheap the stock is, it's difficult not to be bullish. But I do think that, based on the picture and its totality, the company deserves a very solid 'hold' rating. It would be higher if not for worries over declining egg prices. But for now, a more cautious approach is justified.</p>",
