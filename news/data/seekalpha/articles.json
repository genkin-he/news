The company has been struggling to live up to its potential for years, posting<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> stagnant results, but shares still commanded premium valuation multiples in the meantime.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After a further fall earlier this year, shares traded at similar levels as January, yet valuations are still very demanding, even if the company returns to post historically high margins, all of which is making me very cautious.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">All About Machine Vision</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cognex has a mission to make advanced machine vision easy, which in itself is a hard thing to do. The company describes itself as the clear technology leader within advanced machine vision.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps this is best described by comparing the link between the human brain and eyes being applied to machines with optics taking the role of the brain and vision software the role of eyes. This allows machines to guide, identify, and inspect items in various industrial, logistics, and manufacturing environments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company employs about 3,000 workers, who generate just shy of a billion in revenues here, with the competitive positioning supported by nearly 1,500 patents issued and patents pending. In terms of geographical coverage, the business is extremely well diversified across the globe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Automotive is a key end market, with other markets including logistics, electronics, packaging, and, to a smaller extent, semiconductor applications as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the 2010s, the company more or less tripled sales, with revenues just surpassing the billion mark in 2021. Revenues have been stagnant in the years thereafter due to overinvestments during Covid, more challenging macro conditions (certainly within automotive), and perhaps some execution issues as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The boom and subsequent period of stagnation have been seen in the share price as well. A $10 stock in the early 2010s saw shares peak around the $90 mark in 2021, but ever since, shares have come down to the $40 mark at the start of the year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gauging Expectations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the end, 2023 turned out to be a very tough year, with sales down 17% to $837 million, with adjusted earnings reported at just $0.73 per share. Following the announcement of Japanese-based Moritex and a recovery amidst easy comparables, growth was returning in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The full-year results for 2024 were not yet known in January, but it was fair to say that adjusted earnings for the year were only seen around $0.75 per share, flattish compared to 2023. With net cash holdings down to just over a dollar per share, a $40 stock at the start of the year commanded very premium valuation multiples, around 50 times earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In February of this year, Cognex <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/773500753/files/doc_earnings/2024/q4/earnings-result/cognex-press-release-q4-24.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> a 9% increase in 2024 sales to $915 million, in between organic growth reported and the contribution of Moritex. So far the good news is that adjusted earnings only rose by a penny to $0.74 per share, with margins lagging here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company failed to issue a full-year guidance for 2025 but only provided a guidance for the first quarter, with sales seen between $200 and $220 million, as EBITDA margins were seen between 12% and 15% of sales.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2025: Mixed Times</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hurt by some currency headwinds, first-quarter sales <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/773500753/files/doc_earnings/2025/q1/earnings-result/cognex-press-release-q1-25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">rose</a> by just 2% to $216 million, although margins were much stronger, with adjusted earnings up five cents to $0.16 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second quarter sales <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/773500753/files/doc_earnings/2025/q2/earnings-result/cognex-press-release-q2-25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">were</a> up 4% to $249 million as adjusted earnings of $0.25 per share look solid but rose by just two pennies on the year before. Over the summer, the company <a href=\"https://investor.cognex.com/news/news-details/2025/Cognex-Announces-New-Leadership-Team-to-Drive-Strategic-Growth-and-Innovation/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> a new leadership team under new CEO Matt Moschner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the ambitions, the company saw mixed results as activist investor Engaged Capital <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4506284-cognex-gains-after-activst-engaged-capital-reports-stake\">reported</a> a stake in the business in the fall, citing potential for huge upside in the shares, believing that new management could boost margins by 1000 basis points over time, in line with previous performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By the end of October, Cognex <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/773500753/files/doc_earnings/2025/q3/earnings-result/cognex-press-release-q3-25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> an 18% increase in third-quarter sales to $277 million, yet the results benefited from a one-time contribution from a commercial partnership with a medical lab automation channel partner, with revenues otherwise up 13%. Adjusted earnings rose from twenty cents to $0.33 per share, or to $0.28 per share if we adjust for the commercial partnership.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Somewhat disappointing is that stronger momentum is set to slow down dramatically in the fourth quarter, which is surprising after the stronger momentum and new leadership being in place. Fourth quarter sales are seen between $230 and $245 million, suggesting a flattish to 7% increase in sales on an annual basis, with adjusted earnings of $0.19-$0.24 per share, largely in line with a $0.20 per share number reported in the final quarter of 2024.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Now?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares of Cognex fell from $47 to $40 upon the release of the results, with the fourth quarter outlook feeling a bit soft. Right now, realistic earnings are seen just shy of a dollar per share this year, a dramatic improvement from 2024 numbers, but still translating into demanding multiples around 40 times earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net cash holdings stand at $600 million, and with 170 million shares outstanding, net cash holdings stand around $3.50 per share. Down to the $40 mark, operating asset valuations stand at $36.50 per share, for a 37-38 times earnings multiple. Operating assets are here valued around $6.2 billion, and with sales seen close to a billion, sales multiples are seen around 6.5 times sales here. In part to undoubtedly please investors, the dividend was hiked by 6%, now payable at $0.32 per share each year, for a yield below a percent here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In between all this, Cognex has seen somewhat of a more resilient performance in 2025. While revenue and earnings growth is seen, and valuation multiples have come in, overall valuations remain very demanding. The risk-reward proposition still is not looking too favorable here despite long-term drivers in place related to labor shortages, inflation, and the need for automation, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At its peak, Cognex managed to post operating margins around 30% of sales. If that happens on a current one billion revenue base, after-tax earnings could come in around a quarter of a billion, equal to earnings around $1.50 per share.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even if this becomes a reality, it still is hard to justify the current valuations of the operating assets at a mid-twenty times earnings multiple. All this makes me continue to bark at current valuations, even if down over half from the highs in a post-pandemic environment.</p>",

Unfortunately, CoreWeave slumped following the deal agreement, in part due to taking on the debt of the data center projects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The deal has a fixed exchange ratio of 0.1235 shares of CoreWeave for each Core Scientific share. The shareholder vote is on October 30 and based on the current price, Core Scientific shareholders would only get $16.67 per share while the stock has already rallied to over $20 on speculation that the deal will get blocked.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CoreWeave has slumped from ~$160 prior to the deal to only $135 now. The stock fell below $100 around the lockup expiration date, further adding injury to insult to Core Scientific shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AI infrastructure stocks shifting from bitcoin mining have seen substantial gains in the last year. Core Scientific shareholders clearly see the massive gains from IREN Limited (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IREN\" title=\"IREN Limited\">IREN</a>) and TeraWulf Inc.

CoreWeave added a $6.5 billion deal with OpenAI and a massive <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500180-coreweave-pops-amid-new-14b-deal-with-meta-for-ai-power\">$14.2 billion deal</a> with Meta Platforms, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), both of which indicate Core Scientific could land an expanded contract.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While approval of the deal could release CoreWeave to trade higher and provide more value to Core Scientific shareholders, the best solution is probably to just cancel the merger and let the stock prices adjust to market values. After all, both IREN and TeraWulf have tripled since July 7.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key investor takeaway is that the timing of the CoreWeave planned acquisition of Core Scientific didn't make a lot of sense. With CoreWeave facing a major lock-up expiration right after the deal announcement and the natural distraction from the major AI data center growth opportunity, the stocks haven't performed well during this period.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Core Scientific has already rallied into the shareholder vote on October 30, but the stock would appear to have more upside. Not to mention, the company appears past due for additional contracts that would juice the stock.</p>",

It also provided a tailwind for the convertible market, where issuers tend to be small- and mid-cap focused companies. This cohort stands to benefit as equity market leadership broadens beyond mega-cap technology stocks—a development we believe represents a significant opportunity, supported by both fundamental momentum and the historical benefits of rate-cutting cycles for these types of companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, we anticipate continued pro-growth fiscal policies combined with a data-dependent but increasingly accommodative monetary policy framework. Markets have advanced strongly from the tariff-induced concerns earlier in the year and may experience periods of volatility into year-end as investors debate the magnitude of recent gains. Nevertheless, we believe risk assets can continue to benefit from strong fundamental momentum across our core investment themes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The hybrid structure of convertible securities—combining equity-like growth potential with bond-like risk-mitigation characteristics—offers an attractive risk-reward proposition in this environment. We believe active management remains essential, as each convertible security offers unique structural features that can evolve over time, making disciplined security selection and ongoing portfolio management critical to optimizing return profiles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jon Vacko, CFA</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>SVP and Senior Co-Portfolio Manager</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Joe Wysocki, CFA</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>SVP and Senior Co-Portfolio Manager</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">October 2, 2025</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Market Environment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The strong equity market performance in the third quarter contributed to convertibles with the most equity sensitivity (+11.5%), outperforming convertibles with total-return attributes (+10.4%) and those with the most bond sensitivity (+5.1%). At the end of the quarter, convertibles with total-return attributes (39% of the market) exceeded convertibles with the most bond sensitivity (35%) and equity-sensitive attributes (26%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All economic sectors within the US convertible market delivered positive results in the third quarter. Leading sectors included materials (+50.6%), real estate (+21.3%), and industrials (+21.2%). The sectors that lagged the index by the most included consumer staples (+1.0%), communication services (+3.0%), and financials (+3.9%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unrated convertibles (+10.1%) outperformed speculative-grade rated (+5.7%) and investment-grade rated (+4.6%) issues. According to ICE BofA, roughly 79% of the US convertible market was unrated on average at the end of the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global new convertible issuance totaled $54.4 billion in the third quarter. It represented one of the most robust third-quarter volumes in recent memory, catapulting the year-to-date total above $125 billion. This strength reflects how companies strategically use convertibles as a cost-effective tool for capitalizing on growth opportunities and refinancing other forms of debt. We expect this favorable issuance environment to persist into year-end and beyond.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance Review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the quarter ended September 30, 2025, the fund (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CICVX\" title=\"Calamos Convertible Fund Institutional Class\">CICVX</a></span>) returned 9.11% (Class I shares at NAV) versus the ICE BofA All US Convertibles Index return of 8.58%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Positive Influences on Performance</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Information Technology</strong>. The fund’s leading security selection in information technology helped buoy relative performance. Technology hardware, storage &amp; peripherals notably helped, as did communications equipment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Consumer Discretionary</strong>. Favorable security selection and an average underweight position in consumer discretionary added to returns, especially in the broadline retail and homefurnishing retail industries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Negative Influences on Performance</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Real Estate</strong>. Security selection and an average underweight allocation within the real estate sector weakened returns. Specifically, data center REITs and our lack of exposure to real estate services held back relative results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Communication Services</strong>. Security selection and an average overweight position in communication services lost ground on a relative basis, specifically in the movies &amp; entertainment and alternative carriers industries.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Holdings - Contributors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bloom Energy Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BE\" title=\"Bloom Energy Corporation\">BE</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">3.00% Convertible due 2028 |1.5% of fund as of 08/31/25</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Profile:</strong> Bloom Energy Corporation is a clean energy technology company that designs and manufactures solid oxide fuel cell systems for on-site power generation. Its flagship product, the Bloom Energy Server, converts fuels like natural gas, biogas, or hydrogen into electricity through an efficient electrochemical process without combustion. The company serves customers in healthcare, data centers, manufacturing, and utilities with reliable, low-emission energy technologies. Bloom Energy was incorporated in 2001 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Analysis:</strong> Bloom Energy’s stock and convertible securities advanced significantly during the quarter, driven by surging demand for its fuel cell technology to power AI data centers, as highlighted by its major partnership with Oracle. Additionally, bullish analyst upgrades and price target hikes—some more than doubling prior estimates—fueled investor enthusiasm, while strong Q2 earnings and revenue growth reinforced confidence in the company’s operational momentum. We view Bloom Energy as a rapidly scaling clean energy leader, combining upside exposure to AI-driven power demand and hydrogen innovation with downside protection through its fixed-income characteristics of its convertible, which offers the opportunity to participate in Bloom Energy’s common stock with a favorable yield advantage over the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Western Digital Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WDC\" title=\"Western Digital Corporation\">WDC</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">3.00% Convertible due 2028 | 1.8% of fund as of 09/30/25</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Profile:</strong> Western Digital Corporation is a leading global provider of data storage solutions, specializing in hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and flash-based memory products. The company designs and manufactures devices used in everything from personal computing and mobile devices to data centers and enterprise infrastructure. It was founded in 1970 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Analysis:</strong> Western Digital’s stock and convertible securities advanced during the quarter, fueled by surging demand for AI and cloud storage infrastructure, which drove strong revenue growth and margin expansion. The rally was further supported by bullish analyst upgrades, a strategic HDD-Flash business split (Sandisk), debt reduction, and shareholder-friendly actions like buybacks and dividends. Western Digital is now a pure-play hard disk drive provider following the separation of its Flash business, allowing for a more focused strategy and streamlined operations. Its leadership in advanced UltraSMR technology and an aggressive product roadmap position it to benefit from accelerating AI-driven infrastructure and storage demand growth. Western Digital’s balance sheet is improving, and the convertible offers participation in the underlying stock tied to accelerating AI and cloud storage demand with a favorable yield advantage compared to the stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Holdings - Detractors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strategy Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSTR\" title=\"Strategy Inc\">MSTR</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">0.00% Convertible due 2030 | 2.4% of fund as of 09/30/25 0.875% Convertible due 2031 | 1.3% of fund as of 08/31/25</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Profile:</strong> Strategy Inc., together with its subsidiaries, advances bitcoin Treasury related strategies that provide varying degrees of economic exposure to cryptocurrency. In addition, the company provides artificial intelligence-powered enterprise analytics software and services globally. It was incorporated in 1989 and is headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Analysis:</strong> During the quarter, Strategy Inc.’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSTR\" title=\"Strategy Inc\">MSTR</a>) stock and convertibles declined partly due to investor debate around the company’s leverage and dilution risk. Additionally, Bitcoin experienced a period of consolidation after strong gains in the prior quarter. Despite this, the company continued to successfully access the capital markets with its fourth, and largest, preferred security issuance this year. We view investing in the convertible bonds issued by Strategy Inc. as a means of participating in the potential equity upside with measured downside risk and hold a favorable view on their positioning within the overall capital structure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Axon Enterprise (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXON\" title=\"Axon Enterprise, Inc.\">AXON</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">0.25% Convertible due 2027 | 0.8% of 08/31/25</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Profile:</strong> Axon Enterprise, Inc. is a public safety technology company that develops and sells conducted energy weapons under the TASER brand, along with body cameras, in-car video systems, and cloud-based digital evidence management platforms. Axon serves law enforcement, military, corrections, and private security agencies across more than 100 countries. Its mission is to protect life and accelerate justice through a connected ecosystem of hardware and software solutions designed to enhance transparency, accountability, and operational efficiency. Axon Enterprise was incorporated in 1993 and is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Analysis:</strong> Axon Enterprise’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXON\" title=\"Axon Enterprise, Inc.\">AXON</a>) stock and convertible securities declined during the quarter, primarily due to some investor concerns over its acquisition of Prepared, an AI-powered 911 communications company, which raised questions about the acquisition’s fit, the price paid, and the revenue impact, none of which were disclosed. We maintain a constructive view on AXON given its dominant position in TASERs and the fact that it has transformed itself from a TASER-focused business into a differentiated provider of integrated public safety hardware, software, and services with high and growing recurring/subscription/software as a source of revenues. AXON sells into a large and growing market, and its strategy is to further embed customers into the AXON ecosystem through cross-selling body/fleet cameras. As AXON continues this mix shift into software and services, and increasingly incorporates AI into its products, its installed base, margins, and free cash flow should continue to rapidly increase. The convertible offers an opportunity to participate in any continued upside in AXON stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positioning and Portfolio Changes</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our portfolio positioning remains focused on companies poised to benefit from transformative secular and cyclical trends. The AI-related theme continues to be among the strongest across capital markets, impacting virtually every economic sector. These opportunities also align with America-First fiscal policies aimed at rebuilding domestic infrastructure and promoting technology leadership. We continue to selectively identify attractive beneficiaries of these themes, and we believe our strategy of leveraging convertibles to pursue asymmetric payoff profiles (i.e., more exposure to equity market upside than downside) is particularly appropriate for the current environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding economic sectors, the largest portfolio weights are in information technology and industrials on an absolute basis. Conversely, consumer staples and energy represent the smallest absolute sector weights with holdings. On a relative basis, the largest industry overweight positions are systems software and movies &amp; entertainment. The financials and health care sectors constitute the most significant relative underweights. With respect to these sectors, consumer finance and health care equipment are among the underweight industries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Allocations to industrials and energy rose during the period with increased weights in heavy electrical equipment and coal &amp; consumable fuels. By contrast, allocations to communication services and health care decreased over the period with reductions to movies &amp; entertainment and health care equipment.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p>For additional information or to download a fact sheet, please visit the fund’s profile page:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.calamos.com/funds/mutual/convertible-cicvx/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> CICVX - Convertible Mutual Fund | Calamos Investments</a></p> <p><em><strong>Before investing carefully consider the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.

It is constructed using the implied volatilities of a wide range of S&amp;P 500 Index options. The <strong>ICE BofA All US Convertibles Index (VXA0)</strong> comprises approximately 700 issues of convertible bonds and preferreds of all qualities and measures the return of all US convertibles. The <strong>Bloomberg Barclays US Corporate High Yield Bond Index</strong> measures the USD-denominated, high yield, fixed-rate corporate bond market. Securities are classified as high yield if the middle rating of Moody’s, Fitch and S&amp;P is Ba1/BB+/BB+ or below. The <strong>S&amp;P 500 Index</strong> is generally considered representative of the US stock market. The <strong>S&amp;P 500® Equal Weight Index (EWI)</strong> is the equal-weight version of the widely used S&amp;P 500. The index includes the same constituents as the capitalization weighted S&amp;P 500, but each company in the S&amp;P 500 EWI is allocated a fixed weight - or 0.2% of the index total at each quarterly rebalance.</p> <p>Unmanaged index returns assume reinvestment of any and all distributions and, unlike fund returns, do not reflect fees, expenses or sales charges.

The Commercial aerospace market accounts for 40% of sales while military &amp; space accounts for 57% of sales. Another 3% of the revenues is generated in the industrial markets, but with 97% of sales in the aerospace and defense segment it is a near pure-play aerospace and defense company. The company has content on major commercial airplane programs such as The Boeing Company's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA\" title=\"The Boeing Company\">BA</a>) Boeing 737, Boeing 787 and Airbus SE's <span>(</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSF\" title=\"Airbus SE\">OTCPK:EADSF</a><span>) </span>Airbus A320 and Airbus A220. Production ramp-ups are not necessarily smooth, and we have seen the ramp-up trajectory being delayed for several programs. Most recently, Airbus <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airbus-delays-some-a220-output-narrowing-window-reach-2026-target-2025-10-27/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pushed back</a> the ramp-up schedule for the Airbus A220. However, the clear growth driver is higher production rates as seen on the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320neo and Boeing 787 program and all of those programs have a significant ramp-up schedule ahead. The company can <span>also </span>count the major manufacturers of business jets among its customers such as Bombardier Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BDRAF\" title=\"Bombardier Inc.\">OTCQX:BDRAF</a>) and Gulfstream, which is part of General Dynamics Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GD\" title=\"General Dynamics Corporation\">GD</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the defense segment, the company has again Airbus, Boeing and General Dynamics as its customers, but also other names such as General Atomics, Lockheed Martin Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT\" title=\"Lockheed Martin Corporation\">LMT</a>), RTX Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTX\" title=\"RTX Corporation\">RTX</a>) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NOC\" title=\"Northrop Grumman Corporation\">NOC</a>) as the company provides solutions for missiles, radars, drones, fighter jets, bombers, war ships and submarines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company does face some transient pressures as OEM destock on balked production ramp-ups, but overall there is a rather positive growth outlook for the company driven by both of its end markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company gets 55% of its sales from electronic systems, which I believe are becoming increasingly more critical for defense markets and 45% comes from aerostructures. Besides revenue growth opportunities, Ducommun is also working on expanding its margins beyond improved operating leverage. The company has shut down facilities in Monrovia and Berryville, which should drive $11-$13 million in annual savings as the company concentrates production in New York and opts for a low-cost footprint expansion in Mexico. Additionally, the company has targeted 25% of revenue to be generated from engineered products, which should come at better margins and higher aftermarket sales. The company is also tracking well on that. Engineered Product sales grew from 9% of sales in 2022 to 23% in 2024 with a target of 25% in 2027.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Limited Tariff Problems For Ducommun</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1301\" data-height=\"732\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"This image shows the Ducommun sales and manufacturing exposure.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ducommun</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a facility in Mexico, it is also important to assess the risk and the reality is that the risk is manageable. That is because Mexico represents less than 5% of the manufacturing footprint and sales are highly concentrated in the US with 85% of all sales going to the US distantly followed by 7% for Europe, China at less than 3% and Mexico and Canada representing less than 2% of sales. We also note that aerospace and defense products tend to be excluded from tariffs by default and USMCA compliance can be leveraged to avoid tariffs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wall Street Expectations For Ducommun In Q3 2025</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ducommun will report Q3 2025 earnings on the 6<sup>th</sup> of November. The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DCO/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly\">consensus estimate</a> on revenues is $211.9 million indicating 5.2% growth and earnings per share of $0.95 indicating a 3.8% decline likely reflecting some of the transient pressures I mentioned earlier. The estimated range on revenues is $211.3-$212.3 million and for EPS it is $0.89-$1.01. We note that there have been no major revisions over the past three and six months for revenues, but estimates on EPS have come down by 11% over the past three months and 6.9% over the past six months. The company does not have a perfect track record of beating Wall Street estimates. Over the past two years, the company missed estimates on revenues once and twice on EPS.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ducommun Has Significant Upside Ahead</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To determine multi-year price targets, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout/mp_1087?avoid_pp=true#hasComeFromMpArticle=true#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\">The Aerospace Forum</a> has developed a stock screener that uses a combination of analyst consensus on EBITDA, cash flows and the most recent balance sheet data.

That easy upside was the simple fact that the company was trading at levels that did not value the expected earnings in 2025 or the realized earnings in 2025. At current prices, the stock is more or less fairly valued for 2025 earnings. As we are heading into 2026, I believe we should look at the earnings for 2026 which provide a $112 price target indicating 19% upside. I feel that it is still justified to maintain a strong buy rating as I typically set stock price targets based on earnings a year ahead and as we head into 2026, we normally are looking at target levels for 2027. For Ducommun, even without doing that we see upside and the stock is substantially undervalued against peers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On EBITDA estimates, there have been no major changes. For this year, estimates rose 1.4% and for 2026 by 2.6% and a small reduction in expectations of 0.4% in 2027. This provides a total uplift in EBITDA between 2025 and 2027 of 1.3% and a slight CAGR contraction measured from 2024 from 13.7% to 13.5%. On free cash flow, we see a 6.5% upward revision for 2025, but it's down 1.6% in 2026 and 10% in 2027. That is a total reduction to the estimates of 4.6%, but CAGR still stands at 54.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2305\" data-height=\"1309\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"This image shows the key metrics for Ducommun by The Aerospace Forum.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"363\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Aerospace Forum</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we look at the key metric, we see a promising trajectory. Sales are expected to grow 6.5% annually, but perhaps more importantly, EBITDA margins are expected to improve substantially from 13.4% to 18% by 2027. We also see better cash conversion and capital expenditures as a percentage of operating cash flow coming down substantially. The company should be able to bring down its debt substantially and by 2027, the leverage should come down substantially. The company does not pay a dividend and it also does not repurchase shares but with a healthy leverage it could opt to return cash to shareholders. Currently, that is not baked into my estimates but we do see a substantial improvement in the financials that could enable it.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Ducommun Remains Attractive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that Ducommun remains attractive. We note that there may be some transient pressures driven by delayed production ramp-ups and facilities going through learning curves. However, we see strong end market growth in commercial aerospace and defense that the company serves through aerostructure and microelectronics. In my view, that is a very nice business to be active in right now and Ducommun is a supplier to almost all original equipment manufacturers in aerospace and defense which provides them with a wide array of growth platforms for which growing demand could lead to potential outsourcing of work to Ducommun and the company has increased its focus on engineered products which come with less competition and actually no competition since Ducommun owns the IP rights and higher margins. So, I remain positive on the company’s prospects going into 2026 and reiterate my strong buy rating.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Revenues are projected to rise another 3 to 4<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> percent in 2025, showing the continued strength of a sector that grows even as broader media habits shift. What drives this momentum is accessibility, digital connectivity, and cultural ubiquity. Gaming today spans generations, with nearly half of players identifying as female and a rising share of older adults now playing weekly. It is no longer just a pastime; it has become a primary channel for entertainment, creativity, and social interaction.</span></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s Not Just Kids Playing Video Games</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/fe641a483cde4f03942461c0dc5a758c/6350_espo-blog-charts_chart-1_2025-10_v1_blog.svg\" alt=\"It's Not Just Kids Playing Video Games\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: theesa.com as of 02.2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, the gaming business model has matured. Mobile now accounts for about half of global industry revenues, and in-game spending has become the dominant source of monetization. The shift from one-time purchases to ongoing digital transactions has created more predictable revenue streams and stronger engagement cycles. As studios continue to extend the lifespan of popular titles through updates, expansions, and live events, gaming has become a recurring digital economy rather than a series of standalone releases.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">In-App Purchases Are a Material Driver of Revenues</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/32286833de3e4a9b9d4246baabc0a431/6350_espo-blog-charts_chart-2_2025-10_v1.svg\" alt=\"In-App Purchases Are a Material Driver of Revenues\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Statista, as of 06.2025.

Over the past year, strong results from Nintendo, Roblox, and NetEase show how publishers are finding new ways to expand engagement and monetize their audiences. AppLovin was a standout contributor, as its AI-driven ad platform helped developers optimize user acquisition and improve profitability. Tencent also added to returns through steady performance across its global gaming operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some of these names, including AppLovin, Tencent, and AMD, are no longer part of the index due to ESPO’s strict requirement that at least half of company revenue come from gaming and esports. This approach ensures exposure stays pure and aligns with the industry’s long-term growth drivers, not broader tech trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key themes behind performance include:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Expansion of mobile and in-game revenue models supporting recurring growth.</li> <li>Strong content pipelines from global publishers extending franchise longevity.</li> <li>Increased use of AI tools in development, marketing, and player engagement.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AI Acceleration Moment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Artificial intelligence is emerging as the next major catalyst for gaming. In his recent appearance on the Thoughtful Money podcast, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck discussed how <a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/blogs/investment-outlook/jan-van-eck-q4-2025-outlook-escaping-the-reckoning/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\" title=\"Q4 2025 Outlook: Escaping the Reckoning?\">AI may be undervalued</a> by markets when it comes to creative industries. He noted that the leveraged buyout of Electronic Arts highlights how investors may be missing the intersection between AI and gaming’s potential for innovation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gaming companies are poised to embrace AI faster than many other industries because experimentation and rapid iteration are already central to their culture. AI streamlines every layer of the value chain, from how games are made, to how they are played, to how they are marketed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Developers are using AI to build and test new worlds in days instead of months. Gameplay is becoming more adaptive, with storylines and NPCs that respond to player behavior. Studios are marketing smarter, using data to target players and personalize content. Together, these advances are reshaping production cycles, improving engagement, and expanding profitability potential across the ecosystem.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI Game Developers are Adopting AI Tools in All Aspects of Development</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/7ea254e910a340fa9a339851ce013e5b/6350_espo-blog-charts_chart-3_2025-10_v1_blog.svg\" alt=\"AI Game Developers are Adopting AI Tools in All Aspects of Development\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Konvoy, as of 2025. For illustrative purposes only.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gaming’s New Playbook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The intersection of gaming and AI represents one of the most compelling growth frontiers in digital media. As AI tools lower production costs, enhance storytelling, and deepen engagement, gaming is positioned to remain one of the most globally connected and innovative industries. Leadership within the space will evolve, but the underlying growth drivers, including scalable intellectual property, recurring digital revenues, and expanding player engagement, remain firmly intact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The VanEck ESPO ETF captures this evolution through a focused portfolio of companies at the heart of the video gaming and esports ecosystem. By maintaining strict inclusion criteria and global diversification, it offers exposure to a sector that is not only growing but redefining how entertainment, technology, and digital identity intersect.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Approaching the Video Gaming and eSports Opportunity</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For investors, gaining exposure to this fast-changing sector requires focus. The video gaming and esports industry spans publishers, hardware manufacturers, and software platforms that directly generate revenue from interactive entertainment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The VanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF tracks the MVIS Global Video Gaming and eSports Index, which includes companies deriving at least 50 percent of revenue from gaming and esports-related activities. This rule ensures that the portfolio remains centered on companies truly driving industry growth rather than broader tech conglomerates with peripheral exposure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By combining exposure across publishers, developers, and hardware makers, the <a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/video-gaming-esports-etf-espo\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener\" title=\"ESPO - VanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF - Overview\">VanEck ESPO ETF</a> provides a comprehensive view into one of the most creative, innovative, and high-growth corners of global media.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAT\" title=\"Caterpillar Inc.\">CAT</a></span>) this year. By now, it appears that I've likely missed something as the stock has rallied ~40% since <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4820597-caterpillar-tariffs-continue-to-wreak-havoc-on-profitability\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">my latest article.</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> In that analysis I found signs that tariffs were wreaking havoc on the company's profitability and with the valuation being elevated I thought the risk/reward was unattractive. Caterpillar seems to have found a new catalyst: AI.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the analysis <span>below</span>, it is shown that AI is powering strong results in their Energy &amp; Transportation segment. While that's great news, tariff headwinds are alive and well. Profitability was significantly eroded with operating profit and EPS both declining YoY despite good demand. While there should be some optimism as a result of AI tailwinds, I believe the forward P/E's rapid expansion since the middle of the year shows that there has been too much exuberance with no easy fix for the company's profitability woes. The stock trades at a hefty premium and since there seems to be overvaluation, I have decided to stick with my sell rating for now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"649\" data-height=\"233\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Rating History\" width=\"640\" height=\"230\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"230\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618340267624764_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Demand Is Picking Up</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"670\" data-height=\"421\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Sales\" width=\"640\" height=\"402\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"402\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761834681659393_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Caterpillar Q3 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Caterpillar reported <a href=\"https://www.caterpillar.com/content/dam/caterpillarDotCom/releases/3q25/3q25-caterpillar-inc-financial-results.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">2025 Q3 earnings</a> just very recently on October 29th and top-line results show signs that demand is starting to pick up. We'll go into more depth regarding where this strength is coming from a bit later but for Q3, the company as a whole reported sales and revenues of $17.638 billion. This is a fresh all-time record for Caterpillar and it represents growth of 10% YoY. That is a major bounce back after <a href=\"https://www.caterpillar.com/content/dam/caterpillarDotCom/releases/2q25/2q25-caterpillar-inc-financial-results.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">a 1% decline in sales and revenues</a> in their Q2 and so business activity has taken a major turn for the better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, they smashed <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAT/earnings\">consensus expectations</a> as they beat them by a whopping $864.15 million. Even for a company of their size, that is a substantial beat and so their top line was a pleasant surprise for sure. <a href=\"https://s25.q4cdn.com/358376879/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/3Q-2025-Analyst-Slide-Deck-vFinal.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">In the above chart</a> you can see that sales volume was the major driver for growth, again indicating that business activity has improved significantly. There was some minor weakness in price realization that may be an indication of an unfavorable mix but the effects are really negligible when compared to the considerable increase in volume. Lastly, as another sign that demand is becoming robust, Caterpillar reported that their backlog has hit $39.8 billion, a fresh all-time record. Of course, this is welcome news for investors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Energy &amp; Transportation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"719\" data-height=\"405\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Energy\" width=\"640\" height=\"361\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"361\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-1761835383184691_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Caterpillar Q3 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As promised, let's see where all the top-line strength is coming from. Their Energy &amp; Transportation segment is currently their largest segment both by sales and profit and in Q3, it saw by far the strongest results. This is the segment that's directly involved with AI since <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510198-caterpillar-stock-jumps-as-ai-fueled-energy-demand-lifts-earnings\">AI data centers use</a> Caterpillar's battery storage systems and backup generators. I, for one, did not foresee AI providing significant tailwinds to their business but here we are and it really acts as a saviour to the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see above, total sales jumped by 17% YoY as they reported strong sales volume. Their Construction segment saw growth of just 7% while their Resource segment had just 2% growth. The importance of their Energy &amp; Transport segment doesn't end there, however. While profit margin expanded by 10 basis points in this segment, the other two segments saw considerable margin contraction and so in addition to driving top-line growth, AI tailwinds seem to be doing the heavy lifting in terms of the company's profitability. Overall, with AI data center construction showing no signs of slowing down, Caterpillar seems well-positioned to continue benefitting.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tariffs Still A Headwind</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1215\" data-height=\"531\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Tariffs\" width=\"640\" height=\"280\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"280\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/57947294-17618362096111972_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Caterpillar Q3 Earnings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the above chart, the factors affecting operating profit are shown. Despite a healthy growth rate for the top line, operating profit actually fell 3% YoY to $3.052 billion. As you can see, the sales volume strength and price realization weakness carried over from their sales and revenues figures but the main cause of profitability weakness was due to manufacturing costs. In their earnings release, Caterpillar stated that \"unfavorable manufacturing costs largely reflected the impact of higher tariffs.\" This shows that despite the AI tailwinds they are benefitting from, the tariff headwinds that I highlighted in my previous article are still alive and well. If it weren't for the margin strength in their Energy &amp; Transportation segment, things could have been much worse for their profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of profits, Caterpillar reported an adjusted EPS of $4.95 for Q3, representing a 4.26% decline YoY. While that's still undesirable, do note that in Q2, they experienced a 21.2% decline for EPS and so there has been notable improvement. In addition, they managed to beat expectations by $0.43 to show outperformance and so despite the YoY decline, results were still better than feared.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash Flows &amp; Capital Returns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the profitability weakness, Caterpillar managed a nice improvement in cash flows. The company reported ME&amp;T free cash flows of $3.2 billion, representing an ~$500 million increase over the prior year period. While this is, of course, good news, shareholders may not be too thrilled that capital returns actually dropped YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q3, Caterpillar distributed a total of $1.1 billion, ~$700 million in the form of dividends and ~$400 million in the form of share repurchases. While total dividend payout remained relatively stable <a href=\"https://www.caterpillar.com/content/dam/caterpillarDotCom/releases/3q24/3q24-caterpillar-inc-financial-results.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">from the year-ago quarter,</a> stock buybacks dropped significantly YoY from ~$800 million. Therefore, while FCFs improved, the company doesn't seem too eager to share the cash with shareholders. That could be a sign of cautiousness from management.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Caterpillar provided limited numeric financial guidance but still gave some broad ideas of how the outlook is shaping up. For full year 2025, they now expect sales and revenues to be modestly higher than in 2024. This is a change in language from \"slightly higher\" and so in essence, they have raised their guidance. For Q4 in particular, they are expecting \"strong\" sales and revenue growth and so it appears that the AI tailwinds are indeed going to continue for their Energy &amp; Transportation business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With or without tariff effects included, Caterpillar expects the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to be in their annual target range. However, without tariffs, the figure would be in the top half of the range while with tariffs, the figure would be in the bottom half. Therefore, for 2025 as a whole, tariffs will be a significant drag on the company's profitability. Overall, I would say there are not many surprises in their outlook as the AI boost to sales and profitability weakness were already seen in their Q3.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors May Be Overoptimistic</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e13a1a37a7859ea5fada0b955216a113.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see in the chart above, Caterpillar's forward P/E ratio has been in a quite steady uptrend over the past few years. Since the middle of this year, it seems the expansion has picked up speed, and I believe the current reading of 31.45 shows excessive optimism.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Firstly, investors should definitely cheer the arrival of AI tailwinds. I, personally, did not foresee AI data centers having such a profound impact on their Energy &amp; Transportation business and so it's a pleasant surprise. However, the company is not out of the woods. Growth in their other two segments is still relatively sluggish and more importantly tariffs are weighing heavily on profitability. It is unlikely to be an easy fix for profitability as tariffs are really beyond the control of Caterpillar and so while overall demand is back on a good trajectory, headwinds are eroding that positivity as seen by the decline in operating profit and EPS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, I believe investors who are piling into the stock due to the new association with AI have become overoptimistic regarding their outlook. Note that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAT/valuation/metrics\">Seeking Alpha shows</a> the stock is trading at a nearly 50% premium to the Industrials sector according to the non-GAAP forward P/E ratio. Therefore, I would be very cautious about the current valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Concluding Remarks</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While there are some good signs for Caterpillar, in my view investors have gotten ahead of themselves. The elephant in the room was the big boost provided by AI tailwinds but while many are focusing on the resulting improved demand, I believe overlooking the profitability woes would be a mistake. Despite all the optimism, the company's profits actually shrank YoY due to tariffs and with no easy fix to this issue, I would say the outlook is still only mixed. Meanwhile, as shown above, the forward P/E has roared to a multiyear high and is at a major premium to the sector. I believe this shows investors have become a bit too exuberant on the stock. With Caterpillar being overvalued, I have decided to maintain my sell rating at this point.</p>",

Furthermore, unlike many of its peers, it<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> has not been suffering from excessive or overly high valuation levels.

So am I. The company has declined despite what I believe to be a significant improvement in prospects and also somewhat in fundamentals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's look at what we have here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plenty to like, even if the valuation isn't as great</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Infineon is, in large part, a play on things like automotive chip/semiconductor markets. That means if you're bearish or not excessively bullish on the EV trends currently permeating the market, you should (like me) take a somewhat more conservative stance on the company and its potential. Not that it's going to go negative or anything - just not as bullish as some perhaps tend to be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's wrong, however, to say it's <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em>just<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em> EVs. Even the new generation of ICE vehicles needs all manner of sensors - voltage chips and the like, which are supplied by a market leader like Infineon. As I've mentioned earlier, the company is a great player in power efficiency in general, and if you notice what industries across the world are doing, power conservation is definitely part of this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">High-level risks to a legacy, Europe-located company such as this are very macro-oriented. We could mention the fact that China seems very set on developing its own chip industry in the country, but this also needs consideration that Infineon is actually a business that focuses on discrete power, rather than analog power management ICs.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1912\" data-height=\"995\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Infineon 3Q25 IR Presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"333\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618209890766592_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Infineon <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"3q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">3Q25</em> IR Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So what the heck is the difference?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, the former, which is Infineon's focus, are things like transistors and resistors - while the latter are things like so-called PMICs, that combine functions in a single <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em>die<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em>.

Also, it forces Infineon to have manufacturing capacity different from its peers, leading to higher fixed costs in a scenario where supply exceeds demand. Because much of the demand comes from the automotive industry, this means that you should be prepared for volatility. Infineon has actually, as of the last few years, focused more on its automotive and industrial sectors, essentially increasing its exposure to that volatility in turn (divesting smaller business parts).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And while arguments in its favor are healthy growth from increases in products from Infineon, both in ICE and EVs, there is a commodity characteristic to the business that is hard to get away from. Further, because of its exposure to the EU, the company doesn't have access to the advantages of low labor costs that other companies enjoy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, the company performed very well during <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"3q\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">3Q</em>.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1909\" data-height=\"997\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Infineon 3Q25 IR Presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"334\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761820795623189_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Infineon <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"3q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">3Q25</em> IR Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And while I've harped on the company's exposure to automotive, there's exposure to things like general e-mobility, renewables, software, IoT, AI and data that isn't to be underestimated either.

My point here is that for what the company does, there aren't that many significant players in the field, and Infineon is by far the biggest one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With very solid <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"3q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">3Q25</em> results, and an estimate for 2025E fiscal that is sort of a <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em>kitchen sink<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em> year, Infineon is poised to see recovery and growth from the automotive trend shift that we've been able to slightly confirm with businesses like Autoliv (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALV\" title=\"Autoliv, Inc.\">ALV</a>) (albeit a slow trend shift).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The right way to invest in Infineon here is, I believe, for a 3-4 year timeframe. That's the time required to see growth materialize here, but once it does, we can see a significant and market-beating rate of return.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last quarter of 2025E, which reports in about 2-3 weeks, is unlikely to change things here. While my expectation is for the company to return to growth in <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"4q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">4Q25</em> with demand recovery for its products, the YoY results for 2025E are likely to be negative to the tune of a double-digit EPS decline.

That PT still holds. The company is currently trading at €34.3. I considered raising my PT and fair value targets here, but ultimately decided that they still serve. However, I will make it clear here that once things start to grow, I will be raising the fair value and PT's to better reflect what I believe Infineon in a growth environment to be capable of, which is closer to a €50/share fair value at a 20x P/E for the 2028E fiscal, which would in turn imply a PT of about €42/share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But this requires better results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, buying at this valuation comes with a significant upside both to my previous fair value target of €38-€39/share, but also to a longer-term upside. The longer-term annualized RoR here is 15-16% per year at a 5-10 year average, and over 16% at the average 20-year P/E.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1708\" data-height=\"1336\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"F.A.S.T graphs Upside Infineon\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"501\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761822181084294_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span><span></span>F.A.S.T. Graphs <span> Upside Infineon</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, since my last article, Infineon has dropped to valuations I would consider investable here. The combination of upside from 2026-2028E from a recovering automotive market, with the relatively low valuation and the company currently being in a dip, implies this. The fundamentals are reflective of this as well, including a BBB+ credit rating, a 1% yield (low, but safe, and growing), very low debt at below 22% long-term debt/capital, and a market cap, even with the drop, of below €44B at this time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Better alternatives with a similar risk profile are very rare at this time. You could make an argument for STMicroelectronics, which I've also made in a recent article where I covered the company. The upside is 15-17% here as well. I consider Infineon better than STM because of the depth of the EPS drop in STM; however, at this time it is expected to drop by over 60%. Infineon is, simply put, safer here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Texas Instruments, meanwhile, is in a remarkably similar trend as this company, with the exception of no near-term crash (the crash for TXN was in 2024, not 2025, also at about 24%). The issue I have with TXN is the forward valuation premium. This company requires 23-25x P/E to outperform, at 20x P/E like Infineon, it's essentially 0% growth or thereabouts - negative without the impressive 3.5%+ dividend that the company pays.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1720\" data-height=\"1340\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"F.A.S.T graphs TXN Upside\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"499\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761823328241411_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span><span></span>F.A.S.T. Graphs <span> TXN Upside</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, ON Semiconductor (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ON\" title=\"ON Semiconductor Corporation\">ON</a>) may be undervalued, but it is also incredibly volatile and currently has no yield. Its range in the last 52 weeks has been between $31 and $76, which should express the depth of that volatility. The company is also, out of these, the only one with a junk-graded investment rating, and at 15x P/E, the 20-year average, is set to give less than 15% annualized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I therefore consider ON to be uninvestable here as well, with regard to my targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That brings alternatives to either STM or Infineon - and my choice here is Infineon.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"&amp;\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">&amp;</em> Considerations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Infineon were to significantly outperform and some risk factors were not to be as severe as expected, then price targets and fair values could go up to a €38/share or above mark, an attractive price target. Furthermore, historically, we've been able to see valuation levels of over 30x P/E, and if these come back, then the current valuation of 25x P/E is only the beginning. But as things currently stand, Infineon is set to recover as the automotive sector recovers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Significant risks for the company at this valuation are more general in nature. Commoditization of its industry, lower gross margins than its peers, and cyclicality not only of semis, but of end industries can cause further volatility, and for the recovery to take longer than expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond that, I do not view there to be many significant risks to my thesis and price target at this time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Infineon is a very solid business with a good long-term upside. It has sector leadership in multiple, crucial segments in the chip industry, and despite the commoditization of some of its end markets as well as the competitive position from China, I do not view it as unlikely that the company may outperform over the long term. In fact, I view it as likely, and this makes it a <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">Buy</em><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch='\"' htloopnumber=\"640931228\">\"</em> at the right price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't see anything in <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"3q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">3Q25</em> or the coming <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"4q25\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">4Q25</em> to change my thesis or expectation for the company from my assumption of <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">buy</em>, which leads me, as of this time, to increase my rating back to <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">buy</em>, and I maintain my previous PT of €35/share and fair value of €38-€39/share. Once we start seeing concrete recovery, I would increase this to allow for higher multiples.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (<em>italicized</em>).</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p><em>This company is overall qualitative.</em></p></li> <li><p><em>This company is fundamentally safe/conservative <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"&amp;\" htloopnumber=\"640931228\">&amp;</em> well-run.</em></p></li> <li><p><em>This company pays a well-covered dividend.</em></p></li> <li><p>This company is currently cheap.</p></li> <li><p><em>This company has a realistic upside based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion.</em></p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company fulfills 3 out of 3 quality indicators and 1 out of 2 valuation indicators.

Clearly, the price action suggests that the market is not convinced that we will lose a significant amount of Russian oil supply. Yesterday’s meeting between President Trump and President Xi only served to strengthen this conviction, with Russian oil flows to China apparently not part of broader talks between the two leaders. This is important for the market given that China imports around 2m b/d of Russian oil. It’s the only buyer that could meaningfully increase its purchases if India reduced its imports of Russian crude.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On Sunday, OPEC+ is set to meet. It appears likely that the group will agree to another 137k b/d supply increase for December. The uncertainty surrounding sanctions on Russia also supports this increase. However, the move will only reinforce the bearish outlook for the market, adding to the substantial surplus expected through 2026. Obviously, this is assuming no supply shocks from Russia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Middle distillate cracks remain well-supported, with lingering uncertainty over the impact of sanctions on Russian diesel exports. The ICE gasoil crack is holding around $30/bbl, after a strong rally since mid-October. However, the latest data from Insights Global shows that gasoil inventories in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) region increased by 109kt WoW to 2.27mt, which saw its gap to the 5-year average widen. In Singapore, meanwhile, after a significant increase in middle distillate stocks the previous week, stocks declined by 6.25m barrels over the last week.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">US natural gas Dec’25 futures rallied 3.7% yesterday, and the strength has continued in early morning trading today. The move higher comes despite US natural gas inventories rising by 74 bcf over the last week, in line with expectations and above the 5-year average increase of 67 bcf. Instead, the market appears to be focused on forecasts for cooler weather, which should prove supportive of demand.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Agriculture - China to buy 25mt of US soybeans annually</span></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CBOT soybean futures extended their upward rally, with prices surging more than 1.9% at one stage yesterday. This was after President Donald Trump announced that China would immediately purchase large volumes of US soybeans. Later, the US administration said that China agreed to buy 12mt of soybeans between now and January, with a further commitment to purchase at least 25mt annually over the next three years. The announced purchases are largely in line with China's imports of US soybeans prior to the trade war. For reference, China imported around 22mt of US soybeans in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The latest fortnightly report from the Brazilian Sugarcane and Bioenergy Industry Association (UNICA) shows that sugarcane crushing in Central-South Brazil stood at 34mt over the first half of October, an increase of 0.3% year-on-year. Sugar output over this period rose 1.25% YoY to 2.48mt. Meanwhile, the sugar mix in CS Brazil over the fortnight was 48.2%, up from 47.3% a year ago. This is despite prices suggesting that mills should favour a stronger ethanol mix. The cumulative cane crush so far this season still lags last year, down 2.8% to stand at 525mt, while cumulative sugar production totals 36mt, up 0.9% YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

In this case, I'm talking about Xerox Holdings Corporation (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XRX\" title=\"Xerox Holdings Corporation\">XRX</a></span>). As you may know, if you follow my work, about 5-6% I allocate to what we might euphemistically call \"troubled\" companies. The company that<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> used to be the leader in copying physical documents in a world where physical documents and copies are going out of style faster than horse-drawn carriages certainly qualifies as one such company. The deterioration since my last \"BUY\" rating for the company certainly speaks for itself, with a negative 65% since that last article a year ago.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm very glad that despite my own rating, I elected to mostly go for other risky companies that have not declined as much (though the one I chose has still not beaten the market, speaking about TUI AG (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TUIFF\" title=\"TUI AG\">OTCPK:TUIFF</a>)), but at least haven't lost 65%. My own position in Xerox was, as <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4746052-can-lexmark-save-xerox-i-say-maybe\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4746052-can-lexmark-save-xerox-i-say-maybe\" target=\"_blank\">my communication suggested, a \"small starter position\".</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But there's a difference between crashing that amount and being unrecoverable. When it comes to Xerox, in my last article, I made a case for why the company might be able to save ailing Lexmark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So the question here becomes, because it's been less than 11 months since that piece, is 11 months enough to answer the question of whether the company is going bankrupt?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would argue that it isn't.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This makes today, on earnings day of the 30th of October, an excellent day for updating my thesis on Xerox. Further, after a 60% decline and more, it might be fair to say that the company has dropped enough for me to be interested in investing after all.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Or am I?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's see here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Xerox—Looking at the potential upside on a forward basis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Xerox is, and remains, the leader in print solutions. That is the company's battle cry and what the company has been focusing on for a long time. However, as mentioned above, this industry is currently declining. Will it see a revitalization? I doubt it. Can Xerox corner what there is left, and what, despite the decline, won't go away?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Printing is unlikely to disappear entirely. Certain things are likely to remain needed in printed form. I belong to the group <a href=\"https://www.liontreegroup.com/graphic-design/is-print-really-dead-why-print-marketing-is-making-a-comeback/#:~:text=Print%20isn't%20dying%2C%20it's,%E2%80%93%20The%20Business%20Research%20Company%29.\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.liontreegroup.com/graphic-design/is-print-really-dead-why-print-marketing-is-making-a-comeback/#:~:text=Print%20isn't%20dying%2C%20it's,%E2%80%93%20The%20Business%20Research%20Company%29.\" target=\"_blank\">that believes that printing will not disappear</a> (nor physical material) but exist alongside digital—the question is at what size, and what will the market look at when that transformation is done.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some arguments for printed/physical material are the physical permanence it offers, security, and in many cases, legal needs of some areas and geographies. We have several things here that can only be done with physical print and copies, and I believe that things have gone too extreme to the digital side anyway. So a drop like the one we're seeing today in 3Q25, or the company's drop since the 2024 period, doesn't really faze me, unless it's based on some very real, fundamental trends.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1866\" data-height=\"956\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Xerox Investor Presentation 2025 IR\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"328\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-1761841558278176_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Xerox Investor Presentation 2025 IR</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So what are the fundamental trends?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's remarkable how similar XRX is to some companies I've invested in at extreme lows. I've invested in companies like Unum Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UNM\" title=\"Unum Group\">UNM</a>), Lincoln National Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LNC\" title=\"Lincoln National Corporation\">LNC</a>), and Intrum AB (publ) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ITJTY\" title=\"Intrum AB (publ)\">OTCPK:ITJTY</a>) as well as TUI AG. The commonality for every single one of these investments was that at the time of investing, serious analysts and investors were calling for bankruptcy risks. In the case of Intrum, bonds were trading at below 75 cents on the dollar to par. It was perceived as serious in every single case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, Unum is one of my better investments, Intrum is up 380%, and LNC is up more than 100%. I say this not to toot my own horn, but to tell you that I am comfortable with the ups and downs, provided I can understand them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Xerox is risky. EPS for 2025 is definitely going negative (in my view). The company is B- B-rated (Intrum was worse, was at CCC-). The company still pays a yield, which is something, but it's reduced. Debt is actually high, especially since they bought Lexmark valued at $1.5B, which is now more than 3x the entire market capitalization of the company at a price of below $4/share.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1878\" data-height=\"1026\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Xerox Investor Presentation 2025 IR\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618415400375838_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Xerox Investor Presentation 2025 IR</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If there is one trait I believe you need as an investor going into something like this (as of today, I'm long Xerox), it's patience.

Of course, such an argument is an easy one to make, even if things just keep declining—but in this case, I do believe there is serious reason to expect recovery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I detailed in my original article, the company is likely to be able to leverage some key strengths. One, Lexmark's A4 platform, which is market-leading in the growing core market. It's also likely to be able to capitalize on Lexmark's A3 Models and OEM business, adding Xerox's considerable R&amp;D. Expansion into APAC is likely to drive this further as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is also shifting by expanding into digital services and IT solutions, both very attractive businesses, with areas like document workflows, intelligent document processing, and the like (though Xerox is likely to encounter substantial competition here).</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1867\" data-height=\"848\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Xerox Investor Presentation 2025 IR\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"291\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618417569032366_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Xerox Investor Presentation 2025 IR</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason, dear readers, that I am positive here is because many of the synergies mentioned above are starting to materialize. Revenue is growing, and not in small amounts. It's almost up 25% YoY, and FCF is growing (up over 20%), with debt repayment in full force. The company's adjusted earnings are still impaired, together with operating margins, but again, Xerox is in the absolute middle of a transformation that will take years. No one at the company has told us to expect this to be done at this time. The synergies, as mentioned in the 3Q25, are back-heavy, with most of them coming either in 2026 or 2027. The only thing the company is expecting to manage this year is the initial elimination of double overhead and the like—the heavy stuff comes in the next 36 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In retrospect, I did make one big mistake. I shouldn't have gone positive when I did. I should have entered at a \"Hold\" and waited for some of these issues and likely valuation trends to arrive. The fact that I did not invest a substantial amount of capital yet is no excuse at all—I gave the rating, and this gives responsibility (in my view). Timing of valuation is never easy, and I, of course (obviously), could not expect this, but given the transformations that I've been a part of as an investor, I should have drawn logical links between my tendency to enter too early at times and let this flow to ratings as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I didn't.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So let me be clearer this time. If you invest here, be ready for further declines—not guaranteed, but entirely possible. Xerox now has a load of debt that is unenviable, but most of that debt is laden toward the end of 2029-2039—by that time, we should know whether the company has succeeded or not.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current timeline we have is 2026-2028. For the remainder of the year, the two positive takeaways and expectations we do have are a significant increase in FCF and an operating margin that's likely to trend toward 4-5%. If the company manages this, it will be good. I expect the company in 2026 to manage flat revenue but to be able to go over $300M of gross cost reductions, be able to really start reshaping things here, which should enable an FCF of above $300M per year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That should start to allow for higher valuations here. My current forecast for 2026 is about a dollar's worth of EPS, compared to about the same level last fiscal, and for that to grow by 30-40% in fiscal 2027. Those improvements are likely, in my view, to come from the aforementioned synergies, growth in IT and digital (but I'm less optimistic on this than other analysts), and continued significant downpayment of debt. Since the M&amp;A, almost every cent has gone to paying that down, the best current use of cash. The entry back into the mid-market for printing<a href=\"https://www.explorexeroxproducts.com/Product/Index/IJP900_XPE?Language=en-US&amp;Region=NARS\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.explorexeroxproducts.com/Product/Index/IJP900_XPE?Language=en-US&amp;Region=NARS\" target=\"_blank\"> through the IJP900 is also something I consider to be likely to boost revenues.</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's see what we can make of valuation after 3Q25.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation for Xerox in 2025—look at 2026-2027</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you want to invest here, expect a recovery and profit period of no less than 3 years. My own forecast is this. As I said in my previous article, the market considers most of Xerox's sales to be worthless here. Why do I say this?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because it's currently trading at less than 0.2 to sales, less than 0.7x to revenues, and a book valuation of 0.55x. This is, by the way, despite the fact that analysts are in agreement that revenue is likely to recover close to 2019 levels and above, potentially.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"3026\" data-height=\"2017\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Xerox Revenues TIKR.com\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618425850938566_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Xerox Revenues TIKR.com</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Same thing, by the way, with EBITDA.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"3026\" data-height=\"2017\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Xerox EBITDA forecasts TIKR.com\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618426260485246_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Xerox EBITDA forecasts TIKR.com</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So if both sales and earnings are likely to increase in the future, what could the company be worth?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Depends. And this is what makes a company like this interesting. Less than 1-2 years ago, when the company made $1/share in EPS, it traded at a 12-14x P/E. It currently trades at a negative P/E due to negative earnings this year. But if earnings were to recover to even close to this, and the market saw Xerox at a similar valuation, we're talking several hundred percent in returns.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1722\" data-height=\"1486\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FAST Graphs Xerox Upside\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"552\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618427290336263_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FAST Graphs Xerox Upside</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And remember, the forecast you see above is not based on anything outlandish. If the company manages a net savings amount of $300M over the next few years, this would obviously substantially improve the company's cash flow, which in turn would increase net income. That is what I believe the recovery will come from. The $18/share fair value suggested above isn't even unrealistic, if the company manages this, Xerox traded at $18/share less than 2 years ago, and to my mind it was riskier back then because it didn't have the turnaround plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I've made it part of my investment approach to invest in distressed value, as I call it. Xerox, as I see it, is distressed value. The company is \"down\", but it's getting back up. I don't see any clear risk for bankruptcy or issues. The credit risk is considered high when you look at some bonds out there (try USU98401AE97, for instance), but when you look at what the company manages in EBITDA, revenues, debt payments, and the like, I don't really see the company going bankrupt.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1831\" data-height=\"1001\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Xerox Investor Presentation 2025 IR\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49836612-17618430836841066_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Xerox Investor Presentation 2025 IR</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a risky business, but if you're comfortable with what I consider \"manageable risk,\" then this is for you. I'm taking and adding a long 0.25% position of my portfolio in Xerox at this time, resulting in a 0.29% position, and I expect a big payoff eventually, well over 100-200%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My price target was $14/share. I'm cutting it to fair value $12/share at a $1.2/share EPS and a 10x P/E, with an upside of over 200%. My PT is therefore $8/share, but that makes this company a discount at this price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks &amp; Considerations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market considers Xerox sales \"worthless\". It now also considers the earnings and most of the other parts of the company worthless, going by the way it's valuing the business. It's trading at less than 0.2x to sales, less than 0.7x to revenues, and less than 0.8x to book. The company's book value at this time is higher than the share price, and at almost $3-4/share, not a small amount more than the share price. With Lexmark, this is even better, and I continue to see the risks being outweighed by the positives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Print declines and the company not succeeding in the turnaround remain the core risk here. Because this is such a substantial risk at this point, I would be careful investing at all here, unless you really are comfortable with the sort of risk/reward this offers but also requires in terms of patience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a real potential, just like with Intrum, of a capital loss here, but I consider that to be very unlikely based on 3Q25 and the company seeming to move forward with its turnaround plan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Count me in for now with the following thesis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Xerox offers, following the Lexmark deal and 3Q25 results, an attractive play on printing and printing services, as well as related IT. Following this, the company is becoming a vertically integrated producer and service-offering business, which is attractive, if high-risk.</li> <li>I consider Xerox to be exceedingly cheap here, but the company is a speculative investment. However, this is something I am comfortable with, and I'm increasing my position.</li> <li>I give the company an updated PT of $8/share and a fair value target of $12/share, above which I might sell, depending on how quickly it \"went there\". However, the potential for $18-20 over time is definitely there.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them (<em>italicized</em>).</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em>This company is overall qualitative.</em></li> <li>This company is fundamentally safe/conservative &amp; well-run.</li> <li>This company pays a well-covered dividend.</li> <li><em>This company is currently cheap.</em></li> <li><em>This company has a realistic upside based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion.</em></li> </ul> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company fulfills 1 out of 3 quality indicators and 2 out of 2 valuation indicators. That means 3/5 \"stars\" here, which is enough for an attractive thesis for the company. Based on this and a price target of $8/share share, I see a risk/reward-adjusted upside that's attractive enough for me. I give the company a \"Buy\" rating as of October 2025.</p>",

Market concentration and style factors continued to be headwinds for the portfolio as returns have been dominated by AI stocks, cyclical<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> companies and interest rate-sensitive financials, which are expected to benefit from deregulation.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Health Care holdings were the largest detractor. The sector has been under pressure due to US policy announcements aimed at lowering the price of healthcare. It has also proven a source of funds for investors looking to allocate into the AI theme. However, the announcement of a deal to provide lower prescription prices for government-funded Medicaid patients, but not the larger Medicare channel, may be a turning point for the sector as this lifts some of the regulatory overhang and provides greater clarity for research and development spending. This would be positive for the portfolio’s exposure to the drug discovery value chain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dynamics in the Financials sector have also worked against the portfolio, as easing of regulation favoured large-cap banks which benefit from an increase in capital market related activity. European regional bank KBC (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KBCSY\" title=\"KBC Group NV\">OTCPK:KBCSY</a>) rallied, but companies that typically deliver more consistent earnings through economic cycles, such as consultant Marsh &amp; McLennan (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MMC\" title=\"Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc.\">MMC</a>), have traded lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The lack of exposure to commodities within the Materials sector created a relative headwind, whilst sustainable construction materials maker Sika (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SXYAY\" title=\"Sika AG\">OTCPK:SXYAY</a>) came under pressure as the European construction market remains sluggish. Within Industrials, concerns over AI potentially disrupting business models were negative for data service providers, though better performance came from companies improving resource efficiency or benefiting from energy management and electricity grid investment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consumer Discretionary holdings have been a bright spot with eBay (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EBAY\" title=\"eBay Inc.\">EBAY</a>), which delivered strong results after management refocussed the business on core platforms, rallying. The portfolio’s auto component company Aptiv (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APTV\" title=\"Aptiv PLC\">APTV</a>) rebounded from its lows and gained momentum after it announced a divestment that allows it to focus on higher-margin advanced driving applications, Within Information Technology, companies with exposure to AI infrastructure also performed well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Market overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global equities posted strong gains in Q3 2025, supported by resilient macroeconomic conditions, improving corporate earnings, fiscal stimulus and deregulation in the banking sector. However, market dynamics favouring hypergrowth, cyclical and value stocks have created headwinds for investors focused on quality, and market concentration increased over the period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) in the US was a key catalyst early in the quarter, providing short-term stimulus through extended tax cuts and incentives for domestic reshoring. While concerns linger over its longer-term impact on the US fiscal deficit and inflation, the OBBB helped lift investor sentiment, particularly in large-cap and technology stocks. The US Federal Reserve’s September interest rate cut also helped to support share prices and extend the risk-on rally in equities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emerging markets also performed well, buoyed by a weaker US dollar and supportive policy measures in China, which included new renewable energy standards targeting high-emission industries and support for the technology sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we end Q3, US regulatory uncertainty has eased for Health Care stocks with the announcement of a deal between President Trump and drug company Pfizer to lower prescription drug prices for the government-funded Medicaid programme. In the short term, the US government shutdown may weigh on investor sentiment but historically these shutdowns have been resolved with little impact on equity markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite elevated valuations and increased market concentration, the investment team believe opportunities exist in stocks that have been de-rated despite strong earnings momentum and among companies demonstrating strong secular growth.

The company is benefitting from sustained demand for its cloud infrastructure platform and AI-powered applications. During the period, a US$500bn project was announced with OpenAI and Softbank to build five new AI data centres in the US.</li> <li>Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>)(Semiconductors, US) outperformed during the period as investors rewarded the chip maker’s robust demand outlook driven by surging capital expenditures from ‘hyperscale’ data centre operators.</li> <li>TE Connectivity (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TEL\" title=\"TE Connectivity plc\">TEL</a>)(Electronic Manufacturing Services, US) generated strong performance in Q3, as faster-than-expected data centre revenue and margin expansion from their Industrial Solutions segment facilitated very strong quarterly results.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Detractors (absolute basis)</strong> </p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>London Stock Exchange (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LDNXF\" title=\"London Stock Exchange Group plc\">OTCPK:LDNXF</a>)(Financial Exchanges &amp; Data, UK) has been impacted by concerns that AI may disrupt its Data &amp; Analytics business model which provides investment solutions, risk tools and wealth &amp; enterprise tools. London Stock Exchange is integrating AI into its own business model and believes that the business is defendable as it is based on real-time data, which is hard to replicated with AI, and customers operate within a regulated framework and need to rely on a trusted, verifiable source.</li> <li>Alcon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALC\" title=\"Alcon Inc.\">ALC</a>)(Health Care Supplies, Switzerland) traded lower after Q2 equipment sales for eye surgery were softer than expected. Management indicated orders for its new system ‘Unity’ remain robust, but its launch is being deliberately phased to allow time to train eye surgeons. It will take time to convert these orders to installations and sales, however there should be an acceleration in the second half of the year.</li> <li>Intuitive Surgical (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ISRG\" title=\"Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\">ISRG</a>)(Health Care Equipment, US) has been weak due to news that a competitor is providing refurbished and repurposed instruments at lower prices. However, Intuitive believes price is only one component customers consider, with reliability, security of supply, accuracy and innovation also factors in decision making. Meanwhile, the market for surgical robotics continues to expand with new applications in areas such as cardiac surgery.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market has gone through another period of extreme concentration, with investors’ focus returning heavily to the AI theme and more cyclical or ‘hypergrowth’ stocks. This has resulted in a de-rating of many companies that the investment team believes continue to deliver strong fundamental performance and offer compelling structural growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, within Health Care, the portfolio is focussed on companies providing solutions which reduce the time or cost of drug development or improve patient outcomes through innovative products and services. The headwinds which have impacted the sector may now have reached a peak, leading investors to re-examine their appetite for these companies given the clear strength of sector tailwinds such as innovation of treatments and ageing populations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Within Financials, the portfolio holds companies that are improving access to finance, and businesses which offer greater operational consistency such as data analytics, payment processors and financials consultancy businesses, rather than cyclical, leveraged 'balance sheet' financials. While these stocks are currently out of favour, we believe they remain well placed to benefit from structural growth and deliver superior long-term returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, the portfolio retains holdings in a range of companies that the team sees as able to capture either revenue or cost opportunities through implementing AI innovation into their operations. Some of these stocks have been under pressure as investors anticipate disruption to their business models, while our investment team expects these companies, which include recruitment platforms, semiconductor chip designers and stock exchange operators, to benefit from their investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The investment team’s focus remains on finding companies with compelling structural growth, with quality characteristics at reasonable valuations. The team believes that the portfolio offers truly diversified exposure to multiple powerful trends across both environmental and social sustainability opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Fund overview</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Impax Global Opportunities Fund is a long-only all-cap global equities strategy that invests in high quality companies with sustainability tailwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio managers</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Kirsteen Morrison, David Winborne</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CFA® is a trademark owned by CFA Institute.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Performance attribution as of 09/30/2025</p></td></tr> <tr> <td><p>Sector: Average active weights (%)</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Communication Services</p></td> <td><p>-7.28</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Consumer Discretionary</p></td> <td><p>-6.28</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Consumer Staples</p></td> <td><p>-1.84</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Energy</p></td> <td><p>-3.54</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Financials</p></td> <td><p>1.82</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Health Care</p></td> <td><p>8.24</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Industrials</p></td> <td><p>5.32</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Information Technology</p></td> <td><p>3.81</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Materials</p></td> <td><p>2.30</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Real Estate</p></td> <td><p>-1.93</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Utilities</p></td> <td><p>-2.58</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Cash</p></td> <td><p>1.94</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p>Portfolio characteristics</p></td> <td><p>As of 09/30/2025</p></td> </tr> <tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Market cap (weighted average) ƒ</p></td></tr> <tr> <td> <p>Fund</p> <p>US$564BN</p> </td> <td> <p>Benchmark</p> <p>US$907BN</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Forward price earnings~</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Fund</p> <p>21.2x</p> </td> <td> <p>Benchmark</p> <p>19.1x</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>ROE ο</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Fund</p> <p>22.1%</p> </td> <td> <p>Benchmark</p> <p>21.7%</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Beta∞</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Fund</p> <p>0.95</p> </td> <td> <p>Benchmark</p> <p>-</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Number of securities</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Fund</p> <p>38</p> </td> <td> <p>Benchmark</p> <p>2,509</p> </td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Total relative contribution (%)</p></td></tr> <tr> <td><p>Communication Services</p></td> <td><p>-0.50</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Consumer Discretionary</p></td> <td><p>0.44</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Consumer Staples</p></td> <td><p>-0.22</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Energy</p></td> <td><p>0.09</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Financials</p></td> <td><p>-1.42</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Health Care</p></td> <td><p>-2.13</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Industrials</p></td> <td><p>-0.71</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Information Technology</p></td> <td><p>-0.26</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Materials</p></td> <td><p>-0.92</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Real Estate</p></td> <td><p>0.10</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Utilities</p></td> <td><p>0.08</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Cash</p></td> <td><p>-0.16</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total</p></td> <td><p>-5.62</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Definitions</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><em>ƒ</em></p></td> <td><p>Weighted Average is an average in which each quantity to be averaged is assigned a weight.
