I'm Daniel Snyder from Seeking Alpha. Today, we're jumping into conversation with Michael Del Monte, but we're taking things interstellar. We are diving into an article he wrote just earlier a few months ago about ARKX. That is The Space Exploration &amp; Innovation ETF. I have so many questions. But before we dive-in, Michael, welcome to the show. You've been writing for Seeking Alpha for a little while here. Why Space? What made this ETF pop-up on your radar?</p> <p><strong>Michael Del Monte</strong>: Yeah. It's great to chat with you on the show. Looking forward to the conversation. And, Space is such an interesting and unique concept for investing. You have this large pool of investments that's finally coming back to Earth and no pun intended on that, but there's just a lot of interest right now whether it's for aerospace and defense or for the defense industry or for just satellite communications and just like offshore oil. You have so much money being invested in Space right now. It's just incredible time to be in the industry.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: So, we're going to dive into a couple of the catalysts that you have mentioned to me before, but you wrote this article back in August, and this ETF's up about 16.29% is what I'm seeing here on Seeking Alpha since you wrote that. So, obviously been doing pretty well even though we've been going through weird times in the macro environment.</p> <p>Obviously, the administration stuff has that going on, tariffs. Things are being re-moved all around the world for supply chains. It seems like in Space, also you have a lot of money that's in the private equity side of thing. And that's been a whole topic of conversation is, well, we can't always get access to what's going on. I know a lot of people think about Starlink or what Jeff Bezos is doing. And all these people are working on Space, but we can't usually get access to that unless you're an accredited investor, right? So, this ETF that ARK put together, we'd love to hear your rundown. I mean, what do you think about the expense ratio at 75 basis points? I mean, the assets under management are $522 million. You had mentioned stuff about this being high beta names within the portfolio. Can you give the investors listening today just a little bit of rundown?</p> <p><strong>MDM</strong>: Yeah. So, just at a high level, 75 basis points, that's a normal range for a more thematic type ETF. For an index fund, you might see something quite a bit lower like Charles Schwab or Vanguard is going to be 3 basis points for something that's leveraged. You're going to look at 150 basis points. So, for thematic equity ETF, 75 isn't too terrible of an expense.</p> <p>As far as, like, the high-beta theme, you're looking at companies that are in that high growth stage, going back to the private equity side, that you discussed. A lot of companies are pretty new, pretty innovative, and a lot of them are still pre-revenue. So, they're building up all these expenses, building the technology, whether it's rocket ships, whether it's satellite communications, or whatever it may be related to Space. They're in the development phase, they're in the testing phase, they're in the early stages of revenue or pre-revenue even. So, it's, you don't have a lot to value these companies based on. You don't have earnings, you don't have free cash flow to look at. So, you just basing your assumptions on what the potential growth is going to be for these companies.</p> <p>So, it can result in quite a volatile market for one of them. You're going to see a lot of momentum trading going on within the ETF, within the individual stocks. So, it can lead to, some pretty significant movements relative to the broader market.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: So, let's talk about some other names, right. Rocket Lab Corp, Kratos, L3Harris Technologies, Teradyne, Archer Aviation, Palantir, Advanced Micro Devices. I mean, there's more in here that I think they're up to 33 holdings within this ETF right now, but as you were mentioning, some of them are looking for that next level of growth, right? So, we've been having the track Palantir and AMD. Like, some of those make sense to me, but then you have Archer Aviation, Rocket Lab, they seem a little bit more foreign. So, where is the growth? Where is the revenue coming from for the companies like that?</p> <p><strong>MDM</strong>: Yeah. So, it's really interesting. I think the ETF it has a pretty good balance between I'll call it more traditional but larger aerospace companies that might be more established. And then you have like the newcomers like Rocket Lab, and these guys. So, it's like a balanced type approach to building the strategy. AMD, that's I don't want to call it a no brainer, but it provides a little bit of a baseline, I'll say, for stability.</p> <p>The company's semiconductors, they can be put into satellites. It can be put into whatever you want into the rockets, whatever. So, there's some versatility in there. It's not like they're putting a GPU in the portfolio just because it's the cool thing right now. Palantir, there was a conversation to where the software would be utilized for the Golden Dome project, which is that big satellite project, the defense satellite system that is designed to be a larger scale version of the Iron Dome in Israel.</p> <p>So, it's essentially pulling in a ton of companies and their technology, whether it's laser systems, whether it's propulsion systems, whatever it may be. Pulling in all these companies to integrate this large scale defense system to essentially defend against hypersonic missiles. So, it seems like it's more broad than it is, but it all ties together at the end of the day.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: So, for Golden Dome though, like, what is, from what your research has presented you, what's the timeline on that? Are we talking that this is like a one year project that these companies are going to see hyper growth on their earnings and their balance sheets and everything else? Or is this, like, multi years, if not decades? Like, we have a dream for a project. It might work. It might not. Of course, we know Iron Dome, but, I mean, you go to space, you're talking about completely different physics up there.</p> <p><strong>MDM</strong>: Yeah. You have a bunch of satellites floating around and trying to communicateâ€¦</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: Once they crashed to Earth, almost every week now as well just because they're being decommissioned, right. So, it's like, what's the timeline there? What should investors actually be thinking about? Like, is this going to be in the next few quarters? Are we talking about year-over-year?</p> <p><strong>MDM</strong>: Yeah. So, honestly, that's hard to say. There's no definitive timeline that has been presented at this point as far as I'm aware, but it's a $175 billion project last time I checked, at least to get it up and running and started. As far as the investing horizon goes, it's probably going to take quite a few years just to get the project plan mapped out, who's building what and integrating what into what.</p> <p>So, it's not like you have one company building the, let's say, detection satellites. It's going to be a group of companies building that one component of the satellite. And then you have, like, more of the defense satellites, ones that are being designed to be equipped with directed energy or lasers, to shoot down hypersonic missiles, which are missiles that were, I think they were illegal to be built some years ago, and then the U.S. found out China was developing them. So, it was an uh-oh moment where we need to develop this technology, we need to develop countermeasures, things like that. So, it's one of those things where it needs to be defended against.</p> <p>So, it's going to be quite a long time horizon as far as I'm aware. You're going to look at 5, 10 years to really get things up and running, probably going to be longer. You're probably going to have ongoing maintenance. How long does the satellite have in Space before it needs to be decommissioned and replaced? Like, what was it, like, 10 years or so? It's not that long of a lifetime, when you consider the holistic part of it. So, it's going to be something that you're going to have your large scale investment upfront over the next couple years.</p> <p>You're probably going to have like that testing phase revenue where you get a grant for testing out that technology. You're going to get to the next round of grants to integrate it. It's just an ongoing process for space and defense, projects like that. So, we're probably looking at quite a few years before big money really sets in.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: Okay. And then you had also mentioned to me before, Artemis program and artificial intelligence and how those might support this ETF specifically. What's the cases there?</p> <p><strong>MDM</strong>: Yeah. So, Artemis is quite an interesting project where NASA is essentially looking to land and build a development on the moon or I think it's on the â€“ what is it? The South Pole or the dark side of the moon? Not to - or Pink Floyd there, but, they're looking to build an establishment, an autonomous site on the moon to essentially act as a midpoint, so to speak, to get to deeper space.</p> <p>So, when you launch a rocket to get to space, it used up quite a bit of fuel and resources just to get out of the first atmosphere. So, building that, I guess, moon base is going to be like that refueling station. You're taking your spaceship to the gas station to be able to get further out without having to deal with another layer of intense gravity.</p> <p>So, it's an interesting project. I believe it's had a few delays here and there. Intuitive Machine was one of the companies that was a part of it. They made big headlines the other year with their lander or rover not landing upright and then essentially running out of energy after some time.</p> <p>So, it's an interesting project, a little complex from what it looks like, but it's something that is moving along. What was the other question?</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: Also, we've talked about artificial intelligence would also probably benefit this ETF because of the names like AMD, right? For example. So, wanted to ask you before we wrapped up here, on your article back in August, you said, I reiterate my Buy rating, but advise reducing ARKX exposure as a percentage of a portfolio to manage risk and maintain diversification. And that was north of 16% ago or your 16% return you've had since then. The ETF price from when we're recording this is hovering near $31 a share. I got to ask you now, now there's been a few months, are you still a Buy? Are you still reducing exposure? There's been a lot of changes in the macro environment. What are your thoughts now? Where do you stand with the rating on this ETF?</p> <p><strong>MDM</strong>: Absolutely. So, it still stands at a Buy. Circling back to our conversation earlier about high-beta names, you have the Federal Reserve that's actively, expect â€“ well, they're expected. I don't want to say they're actively because they can change their minds at any time, but they're expected to reduce the interest rate by two incremental cuts throughout the rest of the year. So, two 25 basis point cuts throughout the rest of the year. And then, it seems like they're going to be cutting one more time in 2026, depending on the macro data, which isn't currently coming out with the government shutdown aside from CPI this last week.</p> <p>We could see more cuts. We could see a lot of things change between now and next year. So, in correlation with high-beta stocks, they typically do exceptionally well during interest rate cuts. You have lower cost of financing. You need that alternative to receive yield. So, you can expect or you can typically expect high-beta stocks to do pretty well during periods of lower cost of capital.</p> <p><strong>DS</strong>: Alright. So, you're saying risk on. Alright. Thank you so much, Michael. Everyone, thank you for watching this episode. If you haven't already, go follow Michael on Seeking Alpha. Go to his author profile. He has hundreds and hundreds of different pieces of analysis that he's published. He's publishing new ones all the time, long term focus and stuff like this. So, like, unique ETF. I love it because not a lot of people focus on the Space side of things. For some people, I know it just feels like a dream that's a little bit too far or not there yet, but that's what makes it exciting to me.</p> <p>So, Michael, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. Everyone, this has been another episode of ETF Spotlight. I'm Daniel Snyder, and we'll see you next week.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3LhzXon\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Follow Michael Del Monte on Seeking Alpha!</a></strong></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder\"></div><p><strong><a href=\"https://bit.ly/3JABe9w\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Follow ARKX on Seeking Alpha!</a></strong></p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMCI\" title=\"Super Micro Computer, Inc.\">SMCI</a></span>) stock had a few tough weeks after dropping from around $60 to $50. Nevertheless, the stock is still around 9% more expensive than it was when I wrote my previous bullish <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4812674-super-micro-computer-ai-champion-priced-for-distress\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">writeup</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">.

Some indications suggest that SMCI's share price might experience a bumpy road post-earnings. However, the stock is too cheap, and its long-term potential is too strong to ignore. Therefore, I continue buying before earnings and will double down in case of a post-earnings dip. Therefore, my take on SMCI is still Strong Buy.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fundamental analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Super Micro Computer releases its FQ1 2026 earnings next week, November 4th. The stock price already suffered during this earnings season when it dropped by 4% in one day after last week's quarterly sales report revealed a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4507518-super-micro-drops-after-q1-sales-results-miss-estimate-by-nearly-15b\">$1.5 billion massive revenue miss</a>. However, this miss was more kind of noisy headline rather than the company's fundamental problem. The reason is the management's strategic decision to upgrade design wins, which just means that the company hasn't lost these $1.5 billion of this fiscal year's sales but moved it to the next quarter. Therefore, from the perspective of the FY2026 revenue potential, nothing has changed much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"862\" data-height=\"345\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" width=\"640\" height=\"256\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618897526968546_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is still expected to double its revenue between FY2026 and FY2031, according to the above forecast from consensus. And I think that this long-term optimism is not only due to the strength of AI adoption momentum but also because of SMCI's proven ability to capitalize on massive data center tailwinds. There is a 45%+ CAGR demonstrated over the five years across all key financial metrics, which is the number one reason I believe that SMCI is extremely strong in absorbing data center tailwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"969\" data-height=\"431\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" width=\"640\" height=\"285\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-1761889936371374_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is not because of just some luck but thanks to the management's firm commitment to strengthen SMCI's strategic positioning in the new era. I've already mentioned SMCI's growing investments in CAPEX and R&amp;D in my previous coverages. Today, let's talk about more qualitative factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Super Micro recently <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509479-supermicro-teams-up-with-intel-micron-to-set-record-breaking-results-for-quantitative-trading\">struck new partnerships</a> with semiconductor giants like Intel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC\" title=\"Intel Corporation\">INTC</a>) and Micron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU\" title=\"Micron Technology, Inc.\">MU</a>) to achieve \"record-breaking results for quantitative trading benchmarks.\" This is expansion into a new area for SMCI, which can have a potentially huge impact over the long term. According to <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/sp/ter01-piecing-together-the-127-trillion-global-stock-market/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visual Capitalist</a>, the global stock market is worth $127 trillion. And it is only the stock market, while there are other enormous markets using automated trading, like commodities and foreign exchange. Succeeding with this new partnership might open great growth opportunities for SMCI over the long term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another large and thriving area where SMCI <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510241-super-micro-ceo-unveils-expansion-into-federal-market\">recently announced</a> it is expanding into is the federal market, with initiatives to support digitalization of the U.S. government. This is quite promising because the U.S. government is the world's by far largest spender, with its annual budget of <a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/federal-spending/\" rel=\"nofollow\">around $7 trillion</a>. Of course, just a portion of the budget will be allocated to digitalization projects where SMCI can potentially participate. However, modernization of the government and making it more efficient and streamlined is one of the President Trump's top priorities, meaning that we might see some large, interesting projects in this domain as well over the next three years. To improve its chances to win large contracts with the U.S. government, the company currently collaborates with Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) to improve and tailor its offerings to make them a better fit <a href=\"https://www.supermicro.com/en/pressreleases/supermicro-expands-collaboration-nvidia-and-strengthens-compliance-data-integrity-and\" rel=\"nofollow\">for government applications</a>. I think that it is difficult to argue that having Nvidia in your corner is a great asset, which increases your chances of succeeding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A few weeks ago, the company also announced that it now has <a href=\"https://www.supermicro.com/en/pressreleases/supermicro-introduces-new-business-line-data-center-building-block-solutions-data\" rel=\"nofollow\">a new business line</a>, which is the Data Center Building Block Solutions (\"DCBBS\") division. According to the management, this step is aimed at expanding SMCI's reach and cover smaller clients as well. This looks like a logical strategic step to increase long-term revenue growth potential because SMCI has been already successful in working with large clients. Therefore, expanding into the area of smaller players with their DCBBS solutions will likely work well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Super Micro Computer's forward P/E ratio setup looks bullish. SMCI's forecasted FY2027 forward P/E ratio of just 15 is unfairly low given the company's rapid revenue growth and proven record of capitalizing on AI tailwinds. The forecasted dramatic P/E contraction means that Wall Street analysts expect solid EPS growth over the next three years despite competitive pressures.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1117\" data-height=\"516\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" width=\"640\" height=\"296\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618861379440138_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The forward P/E ratio setup is not the only reason why I am confident that SMCI is significantly undervalued.

I think so because there is stability in this ratio at the moment if we compare the TTM basis to the last five years' average. Therefore, to figure out SMCI's fair value as a business, I think that multiplying 1.4 by the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMCI/earnings/estimates?period=annual\">$32.2 billion FY2026 revenue forecast</a> from consensus is a fair approach. The result of this multiplication is $45 billion, meaning there is a compelling 45% upside potential for the next twelve months.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mitigating factors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since we are speaking about SMCI mostly in the context of the upcoming earnings release, I think that the biggest risk at the moment is failing to deliver a strong EPS surprise. As we already said, the public already knows about the revenue miss from the preliminary results release, and this factor was already absorbed by the market. However, the market also has expectations around SMCI's EPS, and missing this one might adversely affect the share price post-earnings. I am cautious in this respect because SMCI's EPS surprise record is not the best, frankly speaking. Three misses over the last five quarters means that the win rate is below 50%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1543\" data-height=\"573\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" width=\"640\" height=\"238\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59768804-17618880811948903_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The risk of SMCI not delivering the expected FQ1 2026 EPS performance might be high, which I see from the ultra-conservative 5.6% upside potential suggested by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMCI/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">Wall Street analysts</a>.

This will be <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4508501-american-water-works-essential-utilities-to-merge-in-all-stock-deal\">a huge merger</a> within the U.S. water utility space.</p> <p>I've been a long-time Essential Utilities shareholder<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> within my buy-and-hold portfolio. So, I've been taking a fresh look at WTRG stock to decide what to do with that position ahead of the potential merger.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why Some Essential Utilities Shareholders Are Displeased</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I've seen some people that seem frustrated with this deal offer. That's understandable due to the limited premium and the firms' respective dividend policies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">American Water Works is offering a roughly 10% premium to where Essential Utilities had been trading prior to the deal announcement. However, there's a catch there. Specifically, this is an all stock purchase, with American Water Works offering 0.305 shares of AWK stock per share of WTRG stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The issue here is that American Water Works stock has traded down by roughly the same amount as the stated premium, meaning that there's been no net benefit to Essential Utilities shareholders because the value of the acquiring company has decreased. Here's a chart showing this in action:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a 10% deal premium and an 11% drop in AWK stock over the past week, any benefit from the acquisition announcement has been effectively offset.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, WTRG stock is actually trading down about 6% since the deal was announced. That's likely because the deal isn't expected to close until the beginning of 2027, so there is a time value of money component to consider as well as it relates to potential merger arbitrage trades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second factor that has irritated some Essential Utilities investors is that the dividend from AWK stock is significantly lower than the dividend from WTRG stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, American Water Works has had a lower dividend yield than Essential Utilities for virtually all of the past decade, with the gap widening notably more recently:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of this writing, WTRG stock is offering a 3.36% dividend yield compared to AWK stock's 2.45% yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, for investors that let their WTRG stock convert into AWK shares once the deal closes, this amounts to a sort of backdoor dividend cut. To put specific numbers to it, Essential Utilities currently pays out $1.37 per share in annual dividends. At the proposed conversion rate of 0.305 shares of American Water Works per Essential Utilities share, investors would receive $1.01 per share in annual dividends from the 0.305 shares of AWK stock that they will be given as merger consideration. That's a meaningful reduction in dividend income.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why The Deal Makes Sense</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's not all bad news, as far as this merger goes, however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The clear positive is that the combined company will be far and away the largest privately-run water utility in the United States. American Water Works already serves millions of people across 14 states, with that set to jump to 17 states once this deal closes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's notable that there are no other U.S. publicly-traded water utilities with a market cap of more than $3 billion. American Water Works' market cap is around $26 billion with Essential Utilities coming in second at $11 billion. The next biggest is <strong>American States Water</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AWR\" title=\"American States Water Company\">AWR</a>) at $2.8 billion. As such, the combined firm will be far and away the biggest player in this space once the deal closes, with a likely market cap in the $35-$40 billion range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even prior to announcing this deal, American Water Works was already guiding that it would spend roughly $18 billion on CAPEX between 2025 and 2029. That's a large number, all things considered, and now that figure should further increase as the company takes on the maintenance, repairs, and expansion of Essential Utilities' water infrastructure as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe the company's combined size will make it far and away the most well-known and liquid investment vehicle for the U.S. water utility sector. The practical consequence is that the combined firm should have a lower cost of capital than its peers and be able to sell bonds at attractive interest rates thanks to its scale and platform advantage. It will also be a leading bidder when privately held water systems come up for public sale. With its low cost of capital and national-scale footprint, it is a logical acquirer to keep rolling up smaller water systems around the country.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, I would note that American Water Works has grown earnings per share more quickly than Essential Utilities over the past decade. Essential Utilities got a boost from its 2020 acquisition of <strong>Peoples Natural Gas</strong>, but aside from that, American Water Works has generally had a more favorable growth profile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That is to say that while investors are making a sacrifice in terms of the starting dividend yield today in swapping WTRG shares for American Water Works, this could be offset with a higher earnings per share growth rate. And, ultimately, stronger EPS growth should lead to solid annual dividend increases as well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">WTRG Stock Verdict</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I understand why some investors are not pleased with this deal. As a longtime Essential Utilities shareholder myself, I'm not particularly thrilled with the takeover price or premium being offered here. I think WTRG stock should be worth more than $40 per share in a takeover.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, we are getting paid via American Water Works shares, and AWK stock has been basically flat since 2019, which is a major deviation from its usual longer-term trend:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, American Water Works revenues and earnings per share have continued to grow at a healthy clip. This continues now, with American Water Works' recent Q3 earnings report showing <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510758-american-water-works-gaap-eps-of-1_94-beats-by-0_05-revenue-of-1_45b-beats-by-120m\">9.8% year-over-year revenue growth</a> and a healthy EPS beat. The Essential Utilities acquisition should also aid that growth rate going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this to say that AWK stock is also trading at a fairly low valuation now compared to its past history. The water utility industry as a whole is dealing with depressed valuations. While I was expecting significant upside in WTRG stock going forward, I see substantial room for AWK stock to trade higher as well once sentiment improves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, as interest rates drop, we may see investors flood back into dividend stocks and defensive risk-off type assets, especially if a recession occurs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Putting these factors together, it's fair to say that I don't love this deal. But I can see the strategic rationale. I certainly get the appeal of having a larger scale business with a lower cost of funding operations, especially as American Water Works is in a significant investment cycle right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At one point, AWK stock had traded up to more than 40x trailing earnings and close to 25x EV/EBITDA. That valuation was hard to justify. But shares have cooled off dramatically since then, and this looks like a reasonably attractive entry point:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, I plan to hold my WTRG shares up through the deal and let them convert into shares of American Water Works.

Capstone has recently <a href=\"https://capstonecopper.com/news/capstone-copper-announces-up-to-360-million-investment-from-orion-for-25-interest-in-santo-domingo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> the partnership with Orion Resource Partners, which has acquired 25% of that project for up to $360M. While Orion is certainly a competent partner for this project, and Capstone needed a partner here not to overextend its balance sheet, the sales price was on the low side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">$360M is about 21% of the net present value of Santo Domingo using the latest feasibility study of this project, where conservative metal prices were used. The copper price was $4.10/lb and the gold price was $1,800/oz in that feasibility study. There is a buyback option in this deal following commercial production, which likely explains the lower sales price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have covered Capstone quarterly over the last couple of years, and my prior articles can be found <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/bang-for-the-buck/analysis?ticker=CS%3ACA\">here</a>. Today's article will focus on the Q3 2025 result that was released yesterday after the close, and the company also hosted a conference call yesterday, which can be found <a href=\"https://capstonecopper.com/investors/events-and-presentations/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock price performance of Capstone sold off substantially in April of this year, which happened to many copper miners, but the drawdown for Capstone was more pronounced. This caused me to add the stock to my portfolio in the C$6-8 range earlier this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capstone has recovered substantially from the lows and is up 37% in U.S. dollar terms this year. Much of the recovery is likely due to the strong copper price, where the COMEX copper price is back above $5/lb and the LME Copper price is not far behind, just below $5/lb. The <a href=\"https://capstonecopper.com/news/capstone-copper-announces-sanctioning-of-mantoverde-optimized-project/\" rel=\"nofollow\">sanctioning</a> of the Mantoverde Optimized project in August of this year has likely been a tailwind as well.

The production is set to grow both in the near term and longer term, while the operating costs will decrease gradually. That is a very attractive combination, especially in the current environment where copper prices are around $5/lb.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"903\" data-height=\"482\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 7 - Source: Koyfin\" width=\"640\" height=\"342\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure 7 - Source: Koyfin</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock price performance for Capstone has been strong from the lows earlier this year, and it has been relatively good in 2025 overall. However, with a higher copper price and higher production expected from Mantoverde Optimized in the next couple of years, the valuation does not feel excessive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The EV to 2026 &amp; 2027 EBITDA is around 5-6, and I do think those EBITDA estimates will be somewhat conservative if the current copper price holds going forward. So, while the risk-reward has worsened some following the recent rally, I still rate Capstone Copper as a buy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There aren't that many copper mining companies with good operating histories and jurisdictions trading at this price. Given that Capstone has plenty of reserves and likely further growth potential from the existing assets, there is still a lot to look forward to for Capstone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Economic weakness or a strong dollar that might impact the copper price are probably the main risks to be aware of, even if the good balance sheet and lower cost operation make Capstone relatively resilient over time. Stable production at the 4 operating mines will be important over the next few years as well, when the company is set to fund the construction of Santo Domingo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1246\" data-height=\"620\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 8 - Source: Capstone Copper Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"318\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure 8 - Source: Capstone Copper Presentation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

This is where I end up looking at things much differently, because I read through the entire earnings report and listen to the earnings call before forming an opinion. Shares of META fell as low as $650.25 as the headline news made the financial community question the CapEx spend and make references to the Metaverse. It wasnâ€™t possible for anyone to go through the data while the sell-off was happening considering the conference call hadnâ€™t happened nor is it possible to read a press release and the financial statements in a millisecond. The main point that the algoâ€™s and traders didnâ€™t calculate in their decisions to sell is that the </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285165-meta-reports-third-quarter-2025-results\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285165-meta-reports-third-quarter-2025-results\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">EPS miss</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> was because of a $18.95 billion tax expense which increased more than $16.5 billion QoQ. They also didnâ€™t see that despite increasing the CapEx spend in Q3 by more than $3 billion to $19.85 billion, their cash generated from operations increased by more than $4 billion QoQ to $29.99 billion.

Since then shares of META have declined by -8.65% while the S&amp;P 500 has increased by 7.52%. I had discussed how META delivered a blowout Q2 which was driven by AI-fueled ad growth and unmatched user engagement as they crushed revenue and EPS estimates. I envisioned a long growth runway as Meta continued to leverage AI, wearables, and its massive user base to unlock new revenue streams and profitability. I felt that the market was underestimating Metaâ€™s AI wearables and future earnings potential as I have learned not to discount Mark Zuckerbergs vision. I am following up with a new article to discuss why I think the market is wrong on META and how this will ultimately turn into an opportunity for long-term investors.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"873\" data-height=\"248\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Meta\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"182\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>What the investment didnâ€™t have time to see as they were fixated on the large EPS miss</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The whole point of quarterly earnings reports is to inform the market and more importantly the shareholders about the progress that is being made within a company. People trading around headlines without caring about the substance within the earnings report is short term capital and that doesnâ€™t matter to me. On the top-line <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285165-meta-reports-third-quarter-2025-results\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285165-meta-reports-third-quarter-2025-results\" target=\"_blank\">META</a> beat revenue estimates by $1.83 billion as they generated $51.24 billion throughout Q3. The reason why everyone sold the news was because META missed on EPS by -$5.66 and generated $1.05 of EPS. If people actually waited until the earnings call was over they would have learned that EPS was down because of a onetime noncash reduction in deferred tax assets that META no longer anticipates using under the new U.S. tax law. Their tax rate would have been 14% if it wasnâ€™t for this charge, instead it was 87%. This is where the market can become shortsighted and created opportunities for long-term investors. Later in the earnings call Susan Li (META CFO) discussed that the transition to the new U.S. tax law may have resulted in an accounting charge in Q3 but they are expecting to recognize significant cash tax savings for the remainder of 2025 and future years going forward. In my opinion this is a horrible reason to dump META as the short term money is more interested in immediate gratification rather than what will ultimately benefit the company going forward.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1432\" data-height=\"559\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"META Cash from Ops\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"250\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Steven Fiorillo, Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is one of the biggest aspects that was overlooked and why I prefer to look at the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META/cash-flow-statement\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META/cash-flow-statement\" target=\"_blank\">cash flow statement</a> over the income statement in many scenarios. I care more about the cash that META is generating from operations and what they are doing with the cash rather than worrying about a one-time tax charge. The reality is that META has continued to increase their CapEx, but their cash from operations continues to expand. META has generated $107.57 billion in cash from operations in the TTM which is an increase of 17.79% YoY ($16.25 billion). The bottom line is that in order for META to increase their revenue they need to reinvest in their buisness. Despite CapEx increasing by 65.15% YoY to $61.53 billion META is still generating $44.23 billion in free cash flow (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCF\" title=\"First Commonwealth Financial Corporation\">FCF</a>). The other aspect that I believe was overlooked was the actual metrics from Q3. METAâ€™s cash from operations increased by $4.44 billion (17.36%) QoQ while their CapEx increase by $3.31 billion (20.03%). META allocated 20.03% more toward CapEx but their quarterly FCF actually increased to $10.15 billion (12.47%) QoQ. So what are people really mad at? I believe that people are getting frantic that the days of spending frivolously on the Metaverse are back but I have a news flash for those investors. This time itâ€™s the entire segment of big tech and not just META. This is the way of the future and to get there these companies need to make massive investments and they are funding it through profitability.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1386\" data-height=\"608\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q3 Deck\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"281\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>META</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside of the crazy interpretation of why META actually missed, I felt this was another strong quarter. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285165-meta-reports-third-quarter-2025-results\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285165-meta-reports-third-quarter-2025-results\" target=\"_blank\">META</a> grew their revenue 26% YoY to $51.24 billion while increasing their gross profit by 26.66% ($8.82 billion) to $42.04 billion. METAâ€™s income from operations increased 18% YoY to $20.54 billion. Itâ€™s crazy that people wanted to sell off a company that has a 82.03% gross profit margin and is operating at a 40.01% margin. The buisness is humming as the family of apps revenue generated $50.77 billion while Reality Labs revenue increased 74% YoY to $470 million. META was in a position to repurchase $3.16 billion of Calls A shares while paying out $1.33 billion in dividends during Q3. I think a big factor to keep in mind is that their net income would have increased by $15.93 billion to $18.64 billion, compared to the reported net income of $2.71 billion. I think everyone should keep in mind that there were 3.54 billion family daily active people using their products which was an increase of 8% YoY while the ad impressions delivered across their family of apps increased by 14%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>There is a lot to be excited about as META continues to position themselves for the future</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">META continues to position itself for the future by aggressively investing in A.I. which could end up ushering in a new windfall of revenue. Meta is focused on establishing itself as the leading frontier A.I. lab and building personal superintelligence that everyone can utilize. Through METAâ€™s superintelligence offerings they are focused on delivering A.I. experiences and computing devices that impact the users that utilize their products. META also continues to lead the marketplace with A.I. glasses as they continue to develop next generation of models and products. META recently announced their 2025 line of Meta Ray-Ban display glasses at Connect which feature a high-resolution display and new AI capabilities. META believes that these endeavors with the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta products will become very profitable products that will be accretive to the bottom line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">META is in a position to leverage itâ€™s A.I. capabilities to enhance its highly profitable family of apps segment to unlock new revenue streams. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835033-meta-platforms-inc-meta-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835033-meta-platforms-inc-meta-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">META</a> is expecting to advance its recommendation systems across several avenues through 2026. This would include surface content that caters to diverse user interests on Instagram while progressing on longer-term ranking innovations in 2026 as they create foundational ranking models and developing new model innovations to produce more relevant recommendations. Reels has grown into an annual run-rate business that exceeds $50 billion as the overall time spent on Facebook and Instagram grew double digits year-over-year in Q3 which was driven by video. The advertising revenue from advertisers using end-to-end automated solutions such as Advantage+ lead campaigns has reached $60 billion. META continues to refine ad supply across its to deliver better and more relevant ads. META continues to see a lot of growth in business messaging which grew 60% YoY and they are opening business AIs to businesses across messaging platforms to help scale conversations and improve sales.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"999\" data-height=\"214\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"META EPS\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"137\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Steven Fiorillo, Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The haircut that META took has made it the cheapest stock in big-tech on a forward earnings basis. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META/earnings/estimates\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META/earnings/estimates\" target=\"_blank\">META</a> is now expected to generate $27.05 in EPS during 2025 and $33.62 in 2027 which is an increase of $6.56 or 24.25% over the next 2-years. META is now the only company in the Magnificent Seven which is trading under 20 times 2027 earnings. The one-time tax expense that META just incurred is nothing more than a one-time expense and this isnâ€™t changing the forward EPS outlook in the analyst projections. This makes me bullish on the long-term potential from the current valuation META is getting and I think this will be looked at as a buying opportunity a year from now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks to investing in META</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I am bullish on META after the sell-off there are several risk factors to consider. Everyone should do their own due diligence as my speculations could be incorrect. Over the past 2-years META has generated $197.33 billion in income operating income from itâ€™s family of apps and generated -$39.29 billion in operating income from Reality Labs. When these are netted out META has still generated $158.04 billion in income from operations over the past 2-years. Part of the reason why META was selling off is because a segment of the investing community is worried that META is gong to continue to increase their spend on CapEX and A.I. wonâ€™t be there profit center that META envisions it will and it will look much more like Reality Labs. The A.I. landscape could also take much longer for META to monetize compared to the amount of capital their allocating toward it and this could negatively impact earnings. There is a lot for investors to consider so please do your due diligence before starting a position in META.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1283\" data-height=\"194\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q3 Deck\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"97\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Meta Platforms</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that the sell-off was unwarranted and that META got caught in the cross-fire between stop-losses and algos trading. The reality is that META had a one-time $18.95 billion tax expense that caused them to produce a major miss on EPS. META got caught in a downtrend immediately without anyone getting a chance to read through earnings or listen to the call. METAâ€™s cash generated from operations increased by more than $4 billion QoQ to $29.99 billion which outpaced the $3 billion that CapEx increased by. META is expecting that they will generate between $56-59 billion of revenue in Q4 and I am expecting that their EPS will be back to normal as their CFO said that the new tax law would create a tailwind for earnings going forward. I believe that META is trading at a strong valuation at less than 20 times 2027 earnings and that we will look back on this period as a buying opportunity rather than the current picture that is being painted of the sky is falling.</p>",

But the nowcast suggests that there was a fair amount of growth momentum in the previous quarter to keep recession risk low.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The partially updated <a href=\"https://www.dallasfed.org/research/wei\" rel=\"noopener\">Weekly Economic Index</a> (WEI), published by the Dallas Fed, suggests as much. WEI edged down to a 2.0% pace for the week through Oct. 25, an estimate that equates with a four-quarter GDP growth thatâ€™s slightly below the 2.1% pace reported for Q2. The report suggests that the economic trend is holding steady. But since some of WEI inputs â€“ weekly jobless claims, for instance â€“ arenâ€™t updating, the latest estimate may be misleading.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Optimists can also point to the Atlanta Fedâ€™s <a href=\"https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow\" rel=\"noopener\">GDPNow model</a>, which is currently estimating a strong 3.9% for Q3 economic activity (as of Oct. 27) â€“ well above the median estimate in the chart above and slightly faster than the Q2 advance. But here, too, the updates should be viewed with a non-trivial degree of skepticism due to the missing data for some of the modelâ€™s inputs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The government shutdown is costing the economy about $7 billion per month, according to a <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-10/61823-Shutdown.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">new report</a> by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Thatâ€™s a rounding error for a $30 trillion economy, but itâ€™s still another headwind at a time when signs of a labor market downshift have been persuading the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This much is clear: the longer the shutdown lasts, the stronger the headwind. Meantime, itâ€™s still reasonable to guesstimate that economic activity grew at a moderate pace in Q3. The outlook for Q4, by contrast, is far more uncertain from the perspective of developing a reasonably accurate nowcast. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.capitalspectator.com/us-economy-probably-grew-at-solid-pace-in-q3/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

This is likely due to a combination of low growth rates (typical of a large company) and what is likely an average valuation for the industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But the price-earnings ratio shown above is well below the average for the market. That would imply that even if the valuation is average as the quant system shows, there could be more stock price progress made as long as the turnaround continues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now with that quant system rating, this may not be the most favorable time for stock price appreciation. After all, the market is looking towards a recession with the implication of weak commodity prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But that is just the time to consider an integrated major. This is the type of company that will lead any industry recovery. Because of the quant system rating, the stock price (in the judgement of the quant system) has a fair chance of going down before it goes up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But given the low visibility of the industry and commodity prices in general, it may be wise to consider dollar cost averaging rather than going \"all-in\" at once.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability, which happens to be my favorite, is rated excellent. Revisions and Momentum are likely keeping the stock price from following much of the industry. Management announced some more portfolio moves to adjust profitability. Each move itself may not be all that material to the latest results. But if management keeps \"tweaking\" the portfolio correctly, then over time a lot of losers will be gone before they can hurt results.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Major Project Pipeline</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like most majors, this company has a long list of upcoming major projects that will likely replace some things that were sold or shut down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2173\" data-height=\"1205\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shell Corporation List Of Material Projects Coming Online In The Near Future\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shell Corporation List Of Material Projects Coming Online In The Near Future <span>(Shell Corporate Presentation Third Quarter 2025)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.shell.com/investors/results-and-reporting/quarterly-results/_jcr_content/root/main/section/simple_copy/promo_1962010312_cop/links/item3.stream/1761789807852/d5fdd917d2b521125c2a10067399225077314fb2/q3-2025-slides.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Since Shell has moved</a> to England (as the last article noted), the company has been justifying that move by refocusing the business on its main oil and gas roots.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the company does venture into \"green\" projects, then those projects have to meet the same profit criteria as the main line of business.

Earnings are still lower this fiscal year than last year. But Mr. Market is always concerned with what is being done recently. A strong quarter can often overcome the reality of the fiscal year results.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Debt Issue</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a side issue the net debt figure also declined in the latest quarterly report. The debt is still above the previous fiscal year. But that decline may well relieve some investors who were worried about climbing debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Understand that the debt was well within \"safe\" territory. The company could likely afford more debt and still be investment grade. However, for those of us who remember back in the late 1970s and early 1980s about Exxon Mobil Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>) having a debt issue that went from next to nothing to a whole $4 billion, there will always be those investors that worry about rising debt, no matter how safe the debt level is. There are enough of them to significantly affect market valuations of at least some stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What any investor needs to understand is that there is a world of difference between rising investment-grade debt levels and non-investment-grade debt that sends the debt ratio \"off the charts\". The reason is that part of the evaluation that leads to an investment-grade rating is that the management will deal with debt issues on a prompt basis (compared to companies with below-investment-grade ratings). This is a general rule and not company-specific. But it does mean that rising investment-grade debt levels are usually not a factor to worry about.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the website noted, Shell<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511031-shell-misses-top-line-and-bottom-line-estimates-initiates-q4-outlook\"> beat the consensus</a>. Some of that beat was likely due to the idea of Shell in the past rather than the progress being made by the refocusing effort. Many times, the consensus is based on the history of the company. But this company is demonstrating that it does not intend to follow that history. Instead, it intends to improve upon that history.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That makes this idea a strong buy for buy-and-hold investors. This is a growth and income story that has an additional boost from the ongoing turnaround effort. A diversified company like this with a relatively high debt rating is considered below average risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But despite the stock price appreciation, the price-earnings ratio is still low during a period of weak commodity prices. To me, this is nothing close to a cyclical top. Instead, weak commodity prices imply a bottom at some point in the future. Generally, cyclical stocks look very expensive at cyclical bottoms due to a lack of earnings. That could mean there is far more long-term upside potential than the market gives this stock credit for.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current bargaining that is resulting in threats of trade wars and tariffs needs to be replaced with something constructive and permanent. If the political uncertainty caused by this bargaining continues, then the much-feared recession can well become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Business tends to \"hunker down\" and pull back during times of uncertainty. The latest <a href=\"https://www.dallasfed.org/research/surveys/des/2025/2503\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dallas Fed Report</a> confirms that trend with a worse 2026 on the way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The uncertainty could make for lower-than-expected commodity prices that are sustained for longer than expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, a diversified company like this one will come through such a period in better shape than many in the industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk is whether or not the stock simplification and the accompanying move to England will pay off in the long run. There are clearly some short-term benefits from the move. But the situation can change to make the move unexpectedly unfavorable or at least not worth the effort.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Taking a step back and evaluating the overall market: the Pandemic inflation surge has passed, enabling the Fed to cut interest rates further this year â€“ which is historically a positive for equity markets; earnings have proven to be resilient and continue to broaden out beyond the Magnificent 7; and secular forces, such as productivity gains from generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI), continue to provide markets an additional tailwind.</li> <li>As we look ahead, innovation is flourishing in many areas of the US economy, and we are continuing to find quality companies across the market cap spectrum in these favored areas. These areas include, but are not limited to, pioneering Gen AI companies in semiconductors and software, as well as industrial companies enabling datacenter expansion and power infrastructure to support it. We are excited about AIâ€™s role in the emerging defense and space technology sector, as a historically low growth area sees an inflection in autonomous software and hardware systems. This positive inflection is also benefiting areas such as cloud, e-commerce, mobility, search, and social networks, as well as non-technology sectors such as Communication Services, Consumer, and Health Care.</li> <li>That said, there are several countervailing factors still in play, such as policy uncertainty. Therefore, we believe security selection is more important than ever as high-quality businesses with strong business models and exceptional management teams should be better equipped to pass through tariffs, adjust supply chains, and find productivity gains from Gen AI tools.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>TOP 10 ACTIVE OVERWEIGHT POSITIONS</strong></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Company</strong></p></td> <td> <p><strong>Fund Weight</strong></p> <p><strong>(%)</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Index Weight</strong></p> <p><strong>(%)</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Active Weight</strong></p> <p><strong>(%)</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Market Cap</strong></p> <p><strong>($B)</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>AppLovin Corp.</p></td> <td><p>3.4</p></td> <td><p>0.5</p></td> <td><p>+2.9</p></td> <td><p>219.1</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Arista Networks, Inc.

Mid and small cap company stocks tend to be more volatile and may be less liquid than large cap company stocks. Mid and small cap companies also may have more limited product lines, markets, or financial resources and typically experience a higher risk of failure than large companies. However, larger companies may have slower rates of growth than smaller successful companies. Investments in growth companies can be more sensitive to the company's earnings and more volatile than the stock market in general. The Fund engages in active and frequent trading of its securities, which may result in increased transaction fees, reduced investment performance, and higher taxes.
