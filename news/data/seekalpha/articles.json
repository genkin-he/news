As shown in the chart below, no other month has experienced a larger median maximum drawdown. Somewhat surprisingly, though, April at -4.5% and January at -4.3% aren’t far behind. What makes the month seem even more volatile than it is, though, is that for anyone who has been around a while, two of the three largest intra-month drawdowns from a high have both occurred in October. In 1987, the S&amp;P 500 declined by more than 34% from peak to trough, while in 2008, it plunged by 28%. The only other months with an intra-month decline of more than 25% were March 2020 (-30.12%) when Covid shut down the economy, and November 2008 (-26.45%) during the financial crisis. It isn’t always a crazy month, but when it is, October sure knows how to disappoint!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1013\" data-height=\"552\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"S&amp;P 500\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"349\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/50624080-1761932492372839_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.bespokepremium.com/interactive/posts/think-big-blog/what-volatility\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

However, the main beneficiary, Nvidia Corporation (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), is expected to continue to enjoy the tailwinds of the AI infrastructure arms race thanks to its undisputed leadership in the GPU market that is growing at a rapid pace. Meanwhile, NVDA's been making recent efforts in expanding AI to new fields such as networking, edge computing, etc.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I continue to rate NVDA as a Strong Buy, and believe that the stock price will likely appreciate rapidly after reaching the recent plateau of $5T market cap. I plan to buy more shares at any dip in the market. The stock price is still at a nice discount in terms of PEG multiples and should be a top candidate for investors who consider adding growth exposures.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA Update - A Fast but Steady AI Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia currently holds a dominant share in the GPU market, reaching 94% in Q2 of 2025, while AMD's share dropped to 6%. The increase has been ongoing. So I believe that NVDA already has had a permanent lock-in in securing the main computing business until the next disruptive technology, like quantum computing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA's flagship products are datacenter GPUs based on its industry-leading Blackwell architecture that keep their technology advantages in the market. The key main products include:<span> </span></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><span>GB200/GB300 NVL72: These are computing supernodes that combine Grace CPUs and Blackwell GPUs designed for massive-scale AI and HPC tasks. </span></li> <li><span>RTX PRO 6000: It is a Blackwell standard server edition built for enterprise data center workloads with AI and visual computing capabilities.</span></li> <li><span>H200 Tensor Core GPU: using the preceding Hopper architecture, this product has performance enhancements for large language model (LLM) inference and HPC workloads. I believe it can also be deployed in a wide range of edge computing cases (see more details later)</span></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia is expecting the revenue to reach over $207 billion at the end of 2026 and continue to grow over 20% in the subsequent two years. Looking at the growth multiples estimated below, NVDA's progress in both earnings and sales has outpaced the projections made in January (box on the left). More specifically, the 2027 growth rates have been upgraded to higher numbers (see highlighted).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1133\" data-height=\"199\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Author/SA data\" width=\"640\" height=\"112\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618623221992276_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>NVDA Growth Estimates (Author-maintained SA Eecords)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The accelerated growth can also be evidenced by the estimates for 2028. The current version is 22.7% which is much higher than the 14.4% estimate <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4777169-nvidia-ai-infrastructure-is-more-critically-needed-than-ever\">recorded</a> in April.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is still some <a href=\"https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/10/29/nvidia-nasdaq-nvda-stock-price-prediction-for-2025-where-will-it-be-in-1-year/\" rel=\"nofollow\">doubt</a> about NVDA's growth on Wall Street, regarding the sustainability and magnitude of its high double-digit growth rate. However, I believe NVDA represents what true AI growth should look like at this stage. I call it a true AI growth barometer for the AI industry.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h2> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">No Sign of Slowdown in the AI Arms Race</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI has shown no signs of slowing down in the buildout of the AI infrastructure. In fact, the most recent earnings report from Microsoft indicated that it will <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510964-microsoft-outlines-fy26-capital-expenditure-acceleration-as-ai-demand-drives-80-percent-ai\">increase</a> its AI spending in 2026 from the record level in 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the power of the current AI models or the differentiation of the LLM models still largely depend on the computing power to provide fast iterations and improvement. This inherently technology-driven demand will likely continue for the next few years until some kind of new generation of AI models/algorithms (e.g., AGI) takes over. This is one of the key reasons why all the mega companies, including Microsoft, Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), and Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>), have announced plans to increase AI spending on infrastructure next year during their earnings report this week. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other significant evidence for sustained GPU growth is that the nuclear energy boom is directly driven by the need for much more AI datacenters. As <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/insights/artificial-intelligence/ai-boom-may-drive-over-60-surge-in-us-nuclear-capacity-by-2050/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a>, the nuclear generation in the U.S. will grow by 27% in the future to in order support the operations of the AI datacenters. So GPU as the core component for these data centers would expect to grow in the same line.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI Edge Use Cases will go a long way</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Compared to the overheated field of Gen AI and large models, one lesser-known AI use case is AI <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/edge-computing/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">Edge Computing. </a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AI at the edge has been a very compelling story for quite some time because of the real-time performance that edge computing facilities can provide. A wide range of AI use cases, such as robotic AI, physical AI, will require real-time communication and highly integrated systems, such as software API calls, to work seamlessly. This is where the AI intelligence running at the edge will be much more advantageous than from a remote AI data center.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The following is a <a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/embedded-computing/\" rel=\"noopener\">snapshot</a> of some examples from a long list of AI use cases shown on Nvidia's edge computing site:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"709\" data-height=\"636\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/tag/embedded-computing/\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"574\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618776277450213_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Edge AI Use Cases (Nvidia)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These highlight many very exciting AI applications in industries such as Robotics, Clinics, Medical, Healthcare, City infrastructure, etc. I believe these use cases have a bright future for AI after the current wave of Gen AI. NVDA's GPUs will play a huge role and see significant growth tailwinds when these applications are developed and deployed on a full scale.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>AI on Networking enables more Applications</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At its most recent GTC event, Nvidia announced to take a <a href=\"https://www.lightreading.com/5g/nvidia-takes-1b-stake-in-nokia-which-promises-5g-and-6g-overhaul?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Issue:%202025-10-30%20Light%20Reading:%20Weekly%20%5Bissue:78344%5D&amp;utm_term=Light%20Reading%20Weekly\" rel=\"nofollow\">$1Billion</a> stake in Nokia and plans to extend its AI technology to the networking areas, such as 5G and the future 6G communication and transportation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe this is a significant move from NVDA to yet another important growing segment of the networking industry. The so-called \"AI-powered 6G\" will create future cellular devices capable of intelligent processing at the edge points of a telecommunication network. Some of the actual use cases will be similar to those for edge computing, as explained very well below on the Nvidia edge site.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The vast amounts of data generated by IoT sensors across various industries offer incredible opportunities to enhance services, optimize operations, and save lives. To achieve this, businesses must deploy AI computing at the network edge, enabling real-time decision-making.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The difference for networking is that the edge AI is running on the networking devices, which will have a huge installed base (like the mobile cell sites) across the world. So it is a strategic expansion in the telecommunications market for NVDA, which started with Nokia's investment and partnership.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still Relatively Cheap Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I started my first coverage on NVDA with a Strong Buy. I projected a future market cap of 10 trillion for NVDA in the whole AI megatrend. The key point was that I expected NVDA to become the market MVP upon reaching 10T instead of reaching the $5T plateau, which might not allow enough time for NVDA to overtake Microsoft or Apple as the most valued player. I also sketched a roadmap as below:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>How long will it take for NVDA to reach the $10T market cap? There are probably two phases involved. The first is that the discount can be made zero in the relatively short term in any bull cycle. This could be anytime in 2025 or as soon as after the Q4 earning report in late February when the growth is confirmed. This implies a 51% gain from the current price level. So $208 will be the target for this phase of run-up and reach the “Median-matched” level, representing about $5 Trillion market cap.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Obviously, NVDA has exceeded my expectations by accomplishing the MVP at $4T and keeps its lead with a market cap of over $5T recently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> If we look at P/E valuations, the earnings growth tables shown earlier reveal a remarkable pattern from the comparison. Both January and the current (October) estimates for the one-year-ahead forward P/E are around 50, and the two-year-ahead P/Es are about 20s. Those are fairly consistent valuations derived at different times (10 months apart).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My key takeaway is that Mr. Market has done a good and fair job in recognizing the growth quality for NVDA. Consequently, it leads to a similar conclusion made previously in January that NVDA stock is still cheap despite the price having appreciated by 64% in the past ten months, as shown below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618638940359132.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4763639-nvidia-expect-growth-momentum-to-continue-with-the-rise-of-agentic-ai\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"267\" height=\"376\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618638940359132.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618638940359132.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618638940359132.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618638940359132.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618638940359132.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618638940359132.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618638940359132.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44152406-17618638940359132.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's NVDA Rating History (SA) </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using my favorite metric to monitor growth tech stock, NVDA's PEG ratio shows a deep discount at almost -30% compared to the sector median.

This stock has consistently been my top growth play in 2025. I have been adding shares at the recent price dips. I believe the stock will continue to outperform in the current AI cycle and be the first company to reach a $10T market cap if all the supporting conditions remain intact.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a secular growth stock, the main risk for investing in NVDA is the potential slowdown of the U.S. economy. Recent reports indicated there have been some layoffs in the technology companies. For example, Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) plans to cut <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/amazon-lay-off-about-14000-roles-2025-10-28/\" rel=\"nofollow\">14000 jobs</a>. The job cut on such a large scale is typically a sign of slowing growth ahead for the company. Whether it is a company-specific issue or an issue for the whole industry will remain to be seen. This should be a key risk factor to be monitored very closely. The industry-wide slowdown will greatly impact the AI growth projection. As the dominant AI infra leader, NVDA will be hit the most.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the technology front, new disruptive innovations, such as quantum computing, could change the AI landscape completely. These are the long-term risks for GPU products. To NVDA's credit, the company has been actively investing in AI startups and developing its own quantum computing technology to keep it up with the potential challenges. NVDA investors should have such risks on their watch.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusions</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are a lot of growth opportunities in the AI technology space. We have witnessed the remarkable growth journey from the GEN AI hype to the current agentic AI (that almost all enterprise players are talking about), the physical/robotic AI, etc., and the edge AI. The GPUs have been and will continue to be at the center of AI computing power, essential for evolving AI technologies and products. NVDA's undisputed leadership position in the current GPU products will support its sales and earnings growth for many years to come. The stock remains a Strong Buy and looks very attractive at the current PEG-discounted levels. </p>",

The drug is called Attruby in the US and marketed as Beyonttra in the EU and Japan. Beyonttra is commercialized by Bayer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAYZF\" title=\"Bayer A.G.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">OTCPK:BAYZF</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) in the EU and by Alexion, a rare disease division of AstraZeneca (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZN\" title=\"AstraZeneca PLC\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">AZN</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) in Japan. Reported analyses show that the drug causes rapid, sustained reductions in cumulative cardiovascular events.

This drug is marketed as Attruby in the US and Beyonttra in the EU and Japan and reduces cardiovascular (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CV\" title=\"CapsoVision, Inc.\">CV</a>) death and CV-related hospitalization. Likewise, the European Commission approved Beyonttra with a centralized marketing authorization in February 2025. Beyonttra is also commercialized in the EU by <a href=\"https://investor.bridgebio.com/news/news-details/2025/beyonttra-acoramidis-the-first-near-complete-ttr-stabilizer-90-approved-by-the-european-commission-to-treat-attr-cm-02-11-2025/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bayer</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BAYZF\" title=\"Bayer A.G.\">OTCPK:BAYZF</a>) and in <a href=\"https://investor.bridgebio.com/news/news-details/2025/beyonttra-acoramidis-the-first-near-complete-ttr-stabilizer-90-approved-in-japan-to-treat-attr-cm-03-27-2025/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Japan</a> by Alexion, AstraZeneca's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZN\" title=\"AstraZeneca PLC\">AZN</a>) rare disease division.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interestingly, BBIO receives tiered royalties for those sales.

October 2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, BBIO has another drug candidate called <a href=\"https://bridgebio.com/news/bridgebio-announces-infigratinib-is-the-first-ever-investigational-therapeutic-option-for-achondroplasia-to-be-awarded-breakthrough-therapy-designation-by-the-fda/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infigratinib</a>. This one is in Phase 3 for achondroplasia in pediatric patients. The trial is already fully enrolled, and topline data is expected in early 2026. The primary endpoint of the trial is annualized height velocity (AHV) over 12 months, and secondary endpoints include body proportionality and safety. If results come in as expected, Infigratinib could be the first oral treatment to challenge other injectable drugs for achondroplasia. Infigratinib is also studied in Phase 2/3 in hypochondroplasia, a closely related FGFR3-driven dysplasia in children.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Attruby’s Competitiveness For ATTR-CM</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that in mind, I believe it’s worth focusing on Attruby. In my view, its main competitors are Pfizer's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>) <a href=\"https://www.pfizer.co.uk/products/prescription-medicines/vyndaqel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tafamidis</a> (Vyndaqel and Vyndamax) and Alnylam's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALNY\" title=\"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\">ALNY</a>) <a href=\"https://investors.alnylam.com/press-release?id=28831\" rel=\"nofollow\">vutrisiran</a> (Amvuttra). Tafamidis is an established oral TTR stabilizer with payer coverage, with a list price of over $200 thousand per year. Vutrisiran won a US label expansion in March 2025 to cover ATTR-CM. This one is a subcutaneous RNAi dosed twice yearly. It’s also more expensive than oral stabilizers, with a potential competitive advantage related to convenient, less frequent dosing schedules.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having said that, I think Attruby’s competitive advantage is its rapid and sustained effects on cumulative CV results. In fact, this alone could be an important reason for patients to switch to this drug. In the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (<a href=\"https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.09.013\" rel=\"nofollow\">JACC</a>) papers published in May and September 2025, the results show that patients on Acoramidis (Attruby) had fewer heart problems overall. Specifically, about half as many total serious heart events over 30 months as those on placebo (49% lower cumulative risk). Also, Acoramidis (i.e., Attruby) seems to deliver cumulative benefits for CV events within 6 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009836204293_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1230\" data-height=\"546\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009836204293_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Corporate Presentation.

October 2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s worth highlighting that Attruby’s list price is around <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-approves-bridgebios-drug-rare-heart-condition-2024-11-23\" rel=\"nofollow\">$244 thousand</a> per year. This is slightly below <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/icer-raises-cost-effective-price-pfizers-attr-drug-final-analysis-still-calls-hefty-discount\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tafamidis’s price</a>, which is approximately $268 thousand per year. However, the price differentiation may not be the main deciding factor for patients because rebates and plan-specific access rules could affect the actual final cost. That’s why sticker price matters less than contracting and coverage. That’s why I think BBIO must now focus on maintaining its edge with clinical benefits, such as swift and long-lasting benefits, and progressing its commercial rollout.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation And Risk Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, from a valuation perspective, BBIO trades at a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBIO\">$12.7 billion</a> market cap after its recent October 2025 report. Its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/18874091\">latest financials</a> show its balance sheet holds $643.0 million in cash and $3.0 million in marketable securities. This amounts to $646.0 million in highly liquid resources against $1.9 billion in financial debt (notes due by 2027, 2029, and 2031) and other regular operating liabilities. Thus, I estimate BBIO’s enterprise value at approximately $14.0 billion at the time of this writing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1118\" data-height=\"468\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Seeking Alpha.\" width=\"640\" height=\"268\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009835587256_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Seeking Alpha.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, according to Seeking Alpha’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBIO\">dashboard on BBIO</a>, the company is projected to generate around $842.0 million in revenues by 2026. That would price BBIO at a forward EV/S of 16.6, which does seem pricey compared to its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBIO/valuation/metrics\">sector’s median</a> forward EV/S of just 3.8. And while this could be a major valuation concern, I think BBIO’s impressive gross margins so far could justify this premium. After all, BBIO’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBIO/profitability\">gross margins</a> track at 96.2%, which far exceeds its peers’ gross margins of 59.7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Likewise, BBIO’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBIO/income-statement\">Q3 EBIT margins</a> again improved YoY from -6849.5% in Q3 2024 to -113.0% in Q3 2025. Naturally, these are still deeply negative operating margins, but it does show how rapidly BBIO is improving its margins. And since BBIO’s topline is expected to add another $347.6 million YoY (relative to 2025), it can bring a lot of shareholder value over time for BBIO based on these trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, there are still some risks, like BBIO’s ongoing cash burn. I calculate that BBIO burned through $112.5 million <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBIO/cash-flow-statement\">during Q3 2025</a>. Note that I got this figure by simply adding its cash flows from operations, CAPEX, and purchases of intangible assets (because it’s a biotech). This would imply an annualized burn rate of around $450.0 million, and a cash runway of 1.4 years, which is a yellow flag.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1495\" data-height=\"593\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Seeking Alpha Charts.\" width=\"640\" height=\"254\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/59327344-17619009837312276_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Seeking Alpha Charts.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, again, the main justification for this is BBIO’s anticipated topline growth and high gross margins. Just to give you an idea, a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBIO\">$347.6 million</a> YoY increase in revenue by 2026 at a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBIO/profitability\">96.2% gross margin</a> translates to an extra $334.4 million in added operating inflows before operating expenses. Still, aside from cash burn concerns, there’s also some potential headline risks at this point. If BBIO’s upcoming NDAs for Encaleret and BBP-418 fail or meet serious setbacks, it could definitely send the shares lower. This is especially true for a stock that’s already trading at a premium, so make sure you size your position accordingly.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Growth Bet</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, BBIO continues to execute on its promises, and growth seems on track to meet its 2026 targets. Naturally, I reckon there are valuation risks (since it trades at an obvious premium), and regulatory hurdles it must overcome in the near term for its new candidates. But aside from these issues, I feel BBIO’s rollout with Attruby definitely shows great promise for long-term investors. In my view, this is a high-margin franchise that over time justifies a GARP “Buy” rating for BBIO at these levels.</p>",

The latest development on this front is the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM) issuing a </span><a href=\"https://discoveryalert.com.au/news/us-strategic-investment-australian-rare-earths-2025/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">letter of interest</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to fund up to US $200 million for VHM's Goschen Rare Earths and Mineral Sands Project in Victoria.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This follows a similar move in September of this year, when EXIM backed US $67 million for Sunrise Energy Metals' scandium project in New South Wales. Both projects are now part of Washington's \"Supply Chain Resiliency Initiative,\" which sources say is designed to reduce dependence on China. The latter country currently dominates over 80% of global rare earth processing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A New Strategic Rare Earths Asset</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Goschen Rare Earths and Mineral Sands Project, developed by VHM Limited in northwest Victoria, is rapidly emerging as a strategic asset in the global race to secure critical minerals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With over 413,000 tons of total rare earth oxide and a proven ore reserve of 199 million tons, Goschen is designed to supply both light and heavy rare earths. Alongside valuable mineral sands like zircon and rutile, these are essential for electric vehicles, defense systems and clean energy technologies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The project has already cleared major regulatory hurdles, including environmental approvals and a mining license, and is positioned within a Tier 1 jurisdiction with robust infrastructure and logistics. Analysts note that its scalable design and dual revenue streams make it one of the most commercially and geopolitically attractive rare earth ventures outside of China.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of Several Globally Significant Moves</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VHM CEO Andrew King called EXIM's decision a globally significant move to resolve current supply chain vulnerabilities. And it is not the only such endeavor. In September, the <a href=\"https://www.australianmining.com.au/us-to-inject-103m-into-sunrise-scandium-project/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener\">EXIM bank</a> had issued a similar LoI to finance Sunrise Energy Metals' Syerston scandium project, marking another strategic move to secure critical mineral supply chains outside China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The funding would cover nearly half of the project's development capital, pending the completion of a feasibility study, which is expected by late October. That analysis will incorporate updated ore reserve estimates as well as an optimized mine plan.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Part of a Strategic Realignment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Many experts following the rare earths sector believe these types of investments aren't just financial, but geopolitical. By securing long-term supply from Australia, the U.S. is executing a \"friend-shoring\" strategy, rerouting critical inputs through trusted allies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the U.S., the supply of critical rare earths has recently become a matter of even greater concern. In April 2025, Beijing imposed export controls on several rare earth elements, effectively weaponizing its mineral dominance amid rising global tensions. American industries, from aerospace to semiconductors, depend on rare earths for magnets, batteries and precision components.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now it seems the U.S. has found a strategic way to bypass China by using financing as foreign policy. By offering 12-15 year repayment terms and streamlining approvals via the Single Point of Entry framework with Australia, the U.S. is accelerating project viability and locking in <a href=\"https://rareearthexchanges.com/news/exim-bank-the-quiet-engine-behind-americas-global-economic-strategy/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener\">future supply</a> as part of its Supply Chain Resiliency Initiative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A final investment decision on Goschen and Syerston is expected within months. When that happens, these projects will become part of America's overall industrial policy. There could also be more U.S.-backed Australian lithium, cobalt and other rare earth projects in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, in Greenland</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to Australia, the U.S. has intensified its interest in Greenland's rare earth reserves. For instance, the Tanbreez deposit is particularly valuable because it contains a high proportion of heavy rare earth elements, which are more scarce and critical for high-performance applications.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, Greenland's geopolitical significance adds another layer to this endeavor. As a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark located in the Arctic, it offers both resource potential and strategic positioning.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

I mentioned in the comments that I have reentered Amazon around the $220 per share level and even more during the $210s. As a long-term holding, Amazon honestly still isn't too expensive and is still at a good entry point, as I'm rerating Amazon to a \"Buy.\"</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWS</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Focusing on AWS first, my main concern was that Google Cloud and Azure's growth rate was accelerating while AWS was decelerating last quarter, with operating margins contracting YoY (due to higher capex, so it wasn't a big deal), as AWS started to lag its peers. The main concern investors and analysts had was the fear that AWS would lag as the trend of AWS revenue growth was trending downwards while its close peers continued to accelerate, which would flip the script and remove Amazon's dominance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mentioned by CEO Andy Jassy in the press release:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>AWS is growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022, re-accelerating to 20.2% YoY. We continue to see strong demand in AI and core infrastructure, and we’ve been focused on accelerating capacity – adding more than 3.8 gigawatts in the past 12 months</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This removes the doubts from investors that Amazon is slowing down anytime soon. I believe this is the main reason that Amazon stock jumped after the results: investors wanted a higher growth rate and got numbers unseen since 2022<span>,</span> which is very bullish. Amazon dumped last quarter as there were huge doubts that Amazon would be able to reaccelerate AWS growth again, which was perfectly shown in this quarter. Mentioned on their <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835958-amazon-com-inc-amzn-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835958-amazon-com-inc-amzn-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">earnings call</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>To put that into perspective, we're now double the power capacity that AWS was in 2022, and we're on track to double again by 2027. In the last quarter of this year alone, we expect to add at least another 1 gigawatt of power.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWS is expected to continue to gain and not fall behind anytime soon, as they have the capacity to meet demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another bullish sign from just over a week ago was the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/dns-error-major-aws-outage-amazon-snapchat-reddit-venmo-2025-10\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/dns-error-major-aws-outage-amazon-snapchat-reddit-venmo-2025-10\" target=\"_blank\">AWS outage</a>, as the outage led to many different services, from Robinhood's brokerage services, Snapchat and Reddit social media platforms, and even SAP's S/4HANA platform, leading to enterprises having to halt their workflows since they all run on AWS. This was a signal to investors and a reminder that AWS remains the largest cloud platform in the world, generating the largest revenue amount in the world, as the reliance on AWS remains high despite a slower growth rate in previous quarters. This quarter's earnings report simply removes the doubt that AWS is slowing down completely.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Main Concern with AWS</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main question now is whether Amazon is still trailing behind with Azure and Google Cloud catching up?</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td>Hyperscalers from Q2</td> <td>Last 4 Quarters Revenue</td> <td><p>1Y</p></td> <td>2Y</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AWS</td> <td>$116.378B</td> <td>$136.16226B</td> <td>$159.3098442B</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Google Cloud</td> <td>$49.192B</td> <td>$64,933.44B</td> <td>$85.7121408B</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Microsoft Azure</td> <td>~$75B</td> <td>$104.25B</td> <td>$144.9075B</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is from my last article's table, and Amazon's growth rate was assumed at 17%, Google Cloud at 39%, and Microsoft Azure at 32%. Using last quarter's cloud growth rates, Google Cloud and Azure in 2 years would close the gap to AWS, as AWS had more revenue than Google Cloud and Azure combined in the last 4 quarters (excluding Q3). Now using the new updated growth rates:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td>Hyperscalers from Q3</td> <td>Last 4 Quarters Revenue</td> <td>1Y</td> <td>2Y</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AWS</td> <td>$121.9B</td> <td>$146.28B</td> <td>$175.536B</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Google Cloud</td> <td>$52.996B</td> <td>$71.01B</td> <td>$95.16B</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Microsoft Azure</td> <td>~$75B</td> <td>$105B</td> <td>$147B</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Note: Azure doesn't disclose their number but disclosed their revenue number surpassed $75B in Q4 FY25 (the quarter prior to this one), so I'm using that number but just changing the growth rate, but the numbers from the last 4 quarters of Azure should be higher.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWS is now reaccelerating with 20% growth YoY from 17% last quarter and expanded operating margin from 32.9% in Q2 to 34.6% in Q3, but it still slightly lags its closest peers. The most recent wave of earnings showed that Azure grew 40% YoY, Google Cloud grew 34% YoY, while AWS is still only growing at 20% YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Google Cloud and Azure combined from the old growth rates were $230.6<span> billion</span>, which is now up to $242.16<span> billion</span>. AWS is growing from $159.3<span> billion</span> to $175.5 billion. Now considering the fact that I'm using old Azure numbers, as the number should be closer to $83 billion in the last four quarters ($75 billion divided by four quarters and make one quarter grow by 40%, while the other three quarters of the $75 billion stay the same), which means in 2Y Azure would be $162.7 billion, which means that the gap between AWS has closed down and that AWS's position of largest cloud provider will be easily threatened. These are all just estimates with their current growth rate and assume their current growth rate doesn't accelerate or decelerate, but should still show the picture to investors that AWS will be lagging its close peers and lose some market share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bottom line is that at least AWS is showing some hope and reaccelerating growth, so it doesn't simply let its top spot get disputed by its closest peers. It needs to continue to show acceleration of growth, as Google Cloud and Azure are also accelerating growth, as Azure's growth rate is double that of AWS. These earnings show that AWS won't just get beaten down and let Google Cloud or Azure run over AWS, but it still needs to show that it can maintain its growth rates, which are already lower than its closest peers. Overall, the reacceleration of growth in AWS is very bullish for the future of Amazon, as a majority of its operating income comes from AWS.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wide Moat</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-1761860033579809_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"854\" data-height=\"609\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-1761860033579809_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Revenue across Business Segment on Amazon Investor Relations\" width=\"640\" height=\"456\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-1761860033579809_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-1761860033579809_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-1761860033579809_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-1761860033579809_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-1761860033579809_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-1761860033579809_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-1761860033579809_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-1761860033579809_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Revenue across Business Segment <span>(Amazon Investor Relations)</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I also mentioned that Amazon has a wide moat as it continues to dominate the retail e-commerce scene and continues to expand a wider range of products. One thing I like about Amazon is that they continue to add to their service rather than just sitting still and not having any new products/services, especially for Amazon Prime. This creates a scenario for consumers where the opportunity cost is high to cancel their Prime subscription, which is still cheap considering the services they offer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just to quickly highlight some points and results from their press release, two new services are available for Prime. They started offering some NBA live coverage in over 200 countries, delivering an average audience of 1.25 million viewers in the U<span>nited States</span> during the season-opening double header, according to Nielsen. Amazon also <span>d</span>rew over 70 million in global views for \"The Summer I Turned Pretty\" as well as expanding same-day delivery for groceries to over 1,000 cities, with over 2,300 by the end of 2025. With a focus on their Amazon Prime Video, which continues to be a success, they continue to grow their advertising business, which still shows no signs of slowing down yet. They also announce partnerships that allow advertisers to buy ad space on Netflix, Spotify, and SiriusXM media through Amazon Ads, as Amazon remains one of the biggest platforms to not just buy day-to-day products, but also enterprise services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With every single segment continuing to show solid growth rates and no real deceleration across every segment, Amazon doesn't really have any weak segments, as all its core businesses continue to thrive.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Amazon and AI</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mentioned in their press release:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>Saw continued strong adoption of Trainium2, its custom AI chip, which is fully subscribed and a multi-billion-dollar business that grew 150% quarter over quarter.</p> <p>Launched Project Rainier, a massive AI compute cluster containing nearly 500,000 Trainium2 chips, to build and deploy Anthropic’s leading Claude AI models.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It was mentioned on the earnings call that Trainium 3 is set to preview by the end of 2025, and Trainium 3 is more efficient than Trainium 2 by 40%:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>But because Trainium is 30% to 40% more price performant than other options out there, and because as customers, as they start to contemplate broader scale of their production workloads, moving to being AI-focused and using inference, they badly care about price performance. And so we have a lot of demand for Trainium.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trainium 2 grew 150% QoQ and is fully subscribed, which suggests that Trainium 3 will be oversubscribed, which is very bullish. With more and more capex and increased cloud capacity within the whole ecosystem, the high demand for Trainium2 and the launch of Trainium3 are signs that the demand for cloud remains strong. If momentum doesn't slow down, Trainium3 could be a huge segment for Amazon as data center operators are focusing on more efficient chips and a training-focused chip, which Trainium can provide compared to more general-use chips. This means lower cost per training unit, which is very important, especially for smaller enterprises, as Anthropic continues to be Amazon's Trainium's biggest customer.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The launch of their AI agents, like Rufus, an AI-powered assistant, has 250 million customers using it, and shoppers using Rufus are 60% more likely to complete a purchase. Noted from the earnings call:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>But if you don't know what you want, it's -- physical store with a physical salesperson still has some advantages. Obviously, lots of people do it on Amazon all the time. But you very often want to ask questions and help -- get help narrowing what you're going to look for. And as you keep asking new questions, having a whole bunch of different options presented to you.</p> <p>And I think AI and agentic commerce are going to change the experience online where that experience where you're narrowing what you want when you don't know is going to get better online than it even is in physical environments.</p> <p>Right now, I would say the customer experience is not. There's no personalization, there's no shopping history, the delivery estimates are frequently wrong, the prices are often wrong.</p> <p>So we've got to find a way to make the customer experience better and have the right exchange value. But I do think that the exciting part of this and the promise is that AI and agentic commerce solutions are going to expand the amount of shopping that happens online.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI agentic experience could change the online shopping experience and replicate a physical store, which targets people who don't really know what they want and need recommendations or to look around. This is seen with features like <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-shopping-app-buy-for-me-brands\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-shopping-app-buy-for-me-brands\" target=\"_blank\">Buy For Me</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It was noted that the experience right now is not good, as it lacks personalization, shopping history, delivery estimates are often wrong, and prices are wrong. Amazon is trying to find a way to change the way that AI agents can find a solution to change the experience for online shoppers with the number of online shoppers today. If Amazon can improve its online shopping experience through AI agents, which don't necessarily have to be their own AI agents, Amazon could be the frontrunner for one of the best experiences for online shopping, which could boost revenue as it increases the likelihood for consumers to spend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As more and more consumers shift to online shopping, Amazon is probably one of the most perfectly positioned companies to utilize AI agents to recommend items to customers. Amazon has the cash to get their hands on one of the top AI agents, has a huge customer base, and has a whole network/supply chain that enables them to ease the customer experience as much as possible, and that no other firm can replicate.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts and Looking Forward</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618620542331684.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Results and Guidance on Seeking Alpha\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"600\" height=\"307\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618620542331684.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618620542331684.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618620542331684.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618620542331684.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618620542331684.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618620542331684.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618620542331684.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618620542331684.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Results and Guidance <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon beat the top and bottom lines and raised guidance for Q4 revenue. This suggests that Amazon continues to show strength and has no signs of slowing down yet, as it is difficult to be bearish when each one of Amazon's segments continues to thrive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the recent earnings, I believe there is a huge narrative shift for Amazon, as the last quarter was slightly bearish, particularly in the weakness of AWS. The temporary weakness has now been straightened out, and any bearish sentiment has been removed. I'm still slightly concerned with the growth rate comparison to its closest peers, but the trend upwards and a growth rate not seen since 2022 are very bullish.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618668355300171_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"846\" data-height=\"567\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618668355300171_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon Valuation Metrics on Seeking Alpha\" width=\"640\" height=\"429\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618668355300171_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618668355300171_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618668355300171_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618668355300171_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618668355300171_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618668355300171_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618668355300171_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/61375197-17618668355300171_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Amazon Valuation Metrics <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are the valuations before the recent jump, and even after a 10% pop, Amazon's P/E is still lower than 40, while P/S is just under 4 on a trailing 12-month basis. This honestly isn't too expensive when Google trades at around 9 P/S and Microsoft trades at around 14 P/S. On a P/E basis, it is still trading way below historical averages, while Amazon's dominance is only getting bigger and better by the quarter. If it trades closer to its P/E non-GAAP trailing 12-month basis, it could suggest as high as 50% P/E upside. Though that is unlikely for a mega-cap like Amazon, the idea is that there is still easily space for Amazon to grow. Up to a 5-year return basis, even after the overnight market pop, Amazon is still underperforming the S&amp;P 500 on a 5Y basis. If Amazon accelerates AWS growth and every segment remains at similar levels, this could easily be Amazon's inflection point.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I already have a decent-sized position in Amazon, as I restarted my position (mentioned in the comments of my last article) when it entered the $220s and even more when it entered the $210s level. I always tend to wait for three days when a stock makes a huge move to either side to see how it swings, but if Amazon swings lower in the next few days, I will be looking to add more to my current position and am happy to add slightly more under $240 and even more under $230. As a long-term holding, Amazon at its current price levels and reassurance that its key business in the AI boom isn't slowing down honestly remains attractive and can easily be a market outperformer. I upgrade Amazon to a \"Buy.\"</p>",

I am of the opinion that the company will generate value for its investors. The firm has diversified its operations, and I think it will continue<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to do so. This aspect will be the main catalyst for the company in the upcoming years.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seaboard is a relevant pork producer in the U.S., but this industry has faced challenging times, which have contributed to the company's undervaluation. Currently, the company's price-to-book ratio is 0.65, just to mention one valuation ratio. Thanks to the Commodity Trading and Milling (CT&amp;M) and Marine operations, the company has been able to stay afloat and generate positive earnings. These operations have counterbalanced the losses reported by the pork segment. I believe that the pork market will experience better moments at one point in the future, and Seaboard will improve its financial position, which should increase its stock price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, Seaboard has invested significant financial resources to expanding its operations. This year, it has integrated five new vessels, which have contributed to expanding its marine operations. Furthermore, its revenues increased by 14.52% in Q3 2025 annually.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has low debt levels. In Q3 2025, Seaboard had $3,557 million in current assets and $2,988 million in total liabilities. As such, it could pay all its debt using its current assets, which indicates its solid <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SEB/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a> position. The company has several disputes in court, which is a risk factor. In addition, commodity prices could decline, representing another aspect of concern. However, I think that Seaboard's positive aspects outweigh the negative ones. For these reasons, I think that Seaboard is an excellent investment opportunity.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Introduction</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is my second article on Seaboard, a company that I believe will experience an increase in its stock price. Since Seeking Alpha published <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798040-seaboard-with-a-stable-net-income-low-debt-and-trading-below-book-value-is-it-undervalued\">my first write-up</a>, the company's stock price has increased by 16.39%. In <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509858-seaboard-gaap-eps-of-113_71-revenue-of-2_54b\" rel=\"noopener\">Q3 2025</a>, Seaboard reported revenues of $2,540 million, which represents a 14.52% increase year-on-year. In addition, that quarter, it reported a net income of $110 million versus a net loss of $149 million in Q3 2024. These results show an excellent quarter.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pork and CT&amp;M Segments</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that Seaboard is a diversified company. The CT&amp;M Segment partially hedges the Pork operations. In other words, if Seaboard's pork operations report financial losses, its CT&amp;M would likely report profit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/88121/000008812125000017/seb-20241231x10k.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener\">Feed is the primary cost</a> of raising hogs. These animals need to eat food on a daily basis, which primarily consists of corn and soybeans. As such, if the price of these commodities increases, it will increase the cost of sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/88121/000008812125000079/seb-20250927x10q.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">In Q3 2025</a>, the Pork Segment of Seaboard reported $544 million in revenues and $458 million in costs of sales. Therefore, costs of sales accounted for 84.19% of the company's revenues. To provide context, animal feed represents a significant portion of these costs. As depicted in the chart below, the Pork Segment has experienced a decline in the cost-of-sales-to-revenues ratio in Q3 2025 compared to the values achieved <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=88121&amp;owner=exclude\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">during 2022-2024</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159427130978.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seaboard's pork segment: cost of sales-to-revenues\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"563\" height=\"302\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159427130978.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159427130978.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159427130978.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159427130978.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159427130978.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159427130978.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159427130978.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159427130978.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Image was created by the author with data from filings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that 2022 and 2023 are meaningful for this analysis. The chart reveals that in those years, the Pork Segment's cost of sales was significantly elevated, which occasioned operating losses in that segment. However, the CT&amp;M Segment reported operating earnings in those years. For instance, <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/viewer?action=view&amp;cik=88121&amp;accession_number=0000088121-24-000025&amp;xbrl_type=v\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">in 2022-2023</a>, this segment reported an accumulated operating profit of $296 million, while the Pork Segment had an operating loss of $459 million. As such, the CT&amp;M Segment partially counterbalances the pork losses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the 2024 Annual Report, Seaboard indicates that its CT&amp;M Segment transports and markets wheat, corn, soybeans, soybean meal, and other commodities. Consequently, the prices of these commodities have an influence on the revenues and net income in this segment. If prices of these commodities increase, Seaboard will obtain higher revenues for each ton of product sold, which will positively affect its net income. Returning to 2022 and 2023, although the Pork Segment reported operating losses due to higher costs of sales, the company benefited from reselling commodities at higher prices. As noted, corn and soybeans are the main raw materials to produce feed for hogs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 2025</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the previous section, I mostly focused on what occurred in 2022-2023, but that is old information. In <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20283356-seaboard-corporation-report-of-earnings-and-dividend-declaration#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">Q3 2025</a>, Seaboard's revenues were $2,540 million, representing a 14.52% increase year-on-year. Operating costs grew less proportionally than revenues. They amounted to $2,342 million in Q3 2025, representing a 12.54% increase compared to Q3 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenues increased due to excellent results of the CT&amp;M, Pork, and Marine Segments. In Q3 2025, CT&amp;M's net sales increased by $235 million on a yearly basis, which represents a 21.08% increase. The company said that this result was due to higher volumes of commodities sold, which was partially offset by lower commodity prices. In addition, the Marine Segment experienced an increase in its net sales, which increased by $51 million (15.69%) year-on-year, reaching $376 million in Q3 2025. Higher cargo volumes and freight rates drive this increase. Furthermore, in Q3 2025, the Pork Segment experienced an annual increase of $42 million in its net sales, representing an 8.37% gain. This increase was due to higher selling prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving to operating income, Seaboard reported $109 million in net income in Q3 2025 versus $149 million in net losses in Q3 2024. A higher profit margin in the Pork Segment contributed to these results. Overall, the company achieved excellent results this quarter.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Debt</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are companies with wonderful businesses, but they often experience financial distress due to inadequate debt management. For this reason, I decided to include this section, which makes the write-up more robust. Further, I spotted Seaboard due to its low debt levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/88121/000008812125000079/seb-20250927x10q.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">In Q3 2025</a>, Seaboard had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1,244 million. That quarter, it had debts (lines of credit and long-term debt) of $1,495 million. As such, it could pay almost all its debt using its cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, which, in my view, is a positive aspect. Secondly, in Q3 2025, the company has $3,557 million in current assets and $2,988 million in total liabilities. Therefore, it could pay all of its liabilities using its current assets. Thanks to these excellent results, it achieved a 37.54% liabilities-to-assets ratio in Q3 2025, which indicates that the company has a solid debt position.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capex</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seaboard has allocated significant resources to expand its operations. I think this aspect will contribute to creating value for its shareholders. As depicted in the following chart, its adjusted capital expenditures (capex) were $348 million in 2019, increasing to $528 million <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=88121&amp;owner=exclude\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">in Q3 2025 TTM</a>, which represents a 51.72% increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159623185384_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"239\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159623185384_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seaboard: net sales and capital expenditures\" width=\"640\" height=\"152\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159623185384_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159623185384_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159623185384_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159623185384_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159623185384_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159623185384_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159623185384_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159623185384_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Image was created by the author with data from filings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798040-seaboard-with-a-stable-net-income-low-debt-and-trading-below-book-value-is-it-undervalued\">my previous article</a> on Seaboard, I noted that, from 2019 to 2024, the company's capex was at least 1.5 times higher than its depreciation and amortization. Thanks to the considerable deployment of capital, the company has expanded its operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q3 2025, Seaboard said that five new dual-fueled vessels were delivered to the company, and the remaining one will be delivered in Q4 2025. In addition, Seaboard mentioned that it entered into an agreement to add a new vessel, which will be worth $75 million. With these investments, its Marine Segment operations will improve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Most of these vessels have been operating on commercial routes between the U.S. and Latin America. For example, in June, <a href=\"https://www.seaboardmarine.com/news/seaboard-marine-launches-fastest-direct-service-from-colombia-to-u-s-northeast-with-new-weekly-calls-to-gloucester-marine-terminal/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">it began</a> weekly sailing from Santa Marta, Colombia, to the Gloucester Marine Terminal in Philadelphia. This is only one of several routes that Seaboard opened this year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Repurchase Program</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seaboard has repurchased its common shares, which is always a positive aspect. In 2020, it had 1,160,779 outstanding common shares, declining to 957,951 in Q3 2025, for a 17.47% decrease. Furthermore, in May of this year, the company authorized a repurchase program to buy up to $100 million in shares by December 31, 2027. This initiative will create value for investors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Ratios</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Up to this point, I have only implemented an analysis concentrated on Seaboard, without including other similar firms. Consequently, this section analyzes some <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/comparison/new/MCUyQ3NlYiUyQ3NmZCUyQ3RzbiUyQ2FkbSUyQ2JnJTJDaHJs\">valuation ratios</a> of Seaboard, Smithfield Foods (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SFD\" title=\"Smithfield Foods, Inc.\">SFD</a>), Tyson Foods (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSN\" title=\"Tyson Foods, Inc.\">TSN</a>), Bunge (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BG\" title=\"Bunge Global SA\">BG</a>), Archer-Daniels-Midland (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ADM\" title=\"Archer-Daniels-Midland Company\">ADM</a>), and Hormel Foods (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HRL\" title=\"Hormel Foods Corporation\">HRL</a>). BG and ADM are direct competitors of Seaboard in its trading business. Meanwhile, SFD, TSN, and HRL raise hogs or manufacture products derived from pork meat. The following table displays the ratios to be analyzed. I highlighted the best ratio in green and the worst in red. In addition, I also analyzed the operating income of Seaboard's business segments in this section.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159759084492_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"945\" data-height=\"158\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159759084492_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seaboard: valuation ratios\" width=\"640\" height=\"107\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159759084492_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159759084492_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159759084492_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159759084492_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159759084492_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159759084492_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159759084492_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619159759084492_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Excluding the P/E ratio, Seaboard has considerably lower valuation ratios than the median in the peer group. The company has a 0.65 price-to-book ratio, the lowest value in the peer group. In other words, it trades below its book value. In addition, it has the second-lowest EV/EBITDA and price-to-cash flow ratios among its peers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that Seaboard trades below its book value due to the losses reported in its Pork Segment. As depicted in the following chart, this segment was the one that led the company's operating income through 2021. However, it has struggled <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=88121&amp;owner=exclude\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">since 2022</a>. This year, the Pork segment has shown signs of improvement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619162701569622.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seaboard: operating income by segments\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"595\" height=\"364\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619162701569622.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619162701569622.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619162701569622.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619162701569622.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619162701569622.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619162701569622.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619162701569622.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/49025622-17619162701569622.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Image was created by the author with data from filings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As commented on in this article, higher commodity prices rendered the operations of the Pork Segment unprofitable in <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/viewer?action=view&amp;cik=88121&amp;accession_number=0000088121-24-000025&amp;xbrl_type=v\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">2022 and 2023</a>. In the Market Outlook section of my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4803776-smithfield-foods-positivity-in-premium-products-and-higher-commodity-prices-despite-trade-difficulties\">SFD article</a>, I discussed that the American pork market faced its worst financial period in decades. However, after every storm should come a period of calm. Consequently, the pork industry should return to generating higher profit margins sooner or later. Ultimately, this should have a positive effect on Seaboard's stock price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The previous chart reveals that the CT&amp;M and Marine Segments of Seaboard have been able to counterbalance the operating losses reported by the Pork Segment. I think this is an essential aspect of Seaboard. If Seaboard's pork operations continue to report financial losses, the company could subsidize these losses due to its CT&amp;M and Marine operations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Peer Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This section conducts a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/comparison/new/MCUyQ3NlYiUyQ3NmZCUyQ3RzbiUyQ2FkbSUyQ2JnJTJDaHJs\">peer analysis</a> among Seaboard, BG, ADM, SFD, TSN, and HRL.

However, its stock price declined by 1.16% over the last five years, which is a negative aspect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a growth perspective, the revenues of Seaboard increased by 4.70% over the last year, considerably higher than the median growth rate. In addition, its revenues increased at a 6.39% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the last five years, the highest value in the peer group. This represents a positive aspect. Furthermore, its EBITDA grew by 100% in the last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving to the profitability ratios, Seaboard has a lower profit margin than its peers. For instance, it has a 1.46% net income margin, while the median ratio is 2.09%. This represents a negative aspect. Finally, Seaboard has a 38.50% debt-to-equity ratio, lower than its respective median ratio. Additionally, it has a higher current ratio than the median ratio. Consequently, the company has a better debt position compared to its peers, which places it at an advantage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I think that Seaboard is in an excellent position. Its revenues have grown at an excellent rate in the last five years. In addition, it has low debt levels compared to its peers, which indicates its solid position.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q3 2025, Seaboard had two main allegations that could undermine its operations. The first one is in the U.S. Several plaintiffs have accused Seaboard of price manipulation in the pork industry. They allege that the company fixed and raised the price of pork and pork-based products in January 2009. According to these plaintiffs, the company used non-public information to coordinate output and limit production.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second allegation pertains to Seaboard's operations in Cuba. Title II of the Cuban Liberty and Solidarity Act of 1996, or the Helms-Burton Act, establishes that any person who traffics with properties that belonged to an American and that were confiscated by the communist Cuban government may be liable to pay the entire property's fair value at the moment they were confiscated. In addition, that person is also liable to pay interest as compensation from the confiscation day to the present, as well as other fees and costs, and on some occasions, treble damages.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that being said, in July 2021, several plaintiffs filed a lawsuit against Seaboard. They alleged that Seaboard carried and/or directed cargo to the Port of Mariel, Cuba. They said they had a 20% ownership interest in a 70-year concession to develop port facilities at Mariel Bay and the surrounding areas. To provide context, in 1960, the Cuban government confiscated this land. In addition, the U.S. Government has been severe with the Cuban authorities. As such, it could implement a drastic measure against companies that have business operations with non-democratic governments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pork and agricultural raw material prices could decline. Under the scenario that pork prices decline more proportionally than agricultural raw materials, it will negatively affect the revenues and net income of the CT&amp;M and Pork Segments.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In light of the analysis presented in this article, I consider Seaboard to be an interesting investment opportunity. As such, I grant it a buy rating. To begin with, the pork market reported signs of recuperation, which was the segment that led the company's profit until 2021. Secondly, Seaboard has low debt levels, which indicates its solid position. In addition, it has repurchased its common shares, creating value for shareholders.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seaboard Corporation has also expanded its marine operations, which have contributed to diversifying and expanding its operations. Among the risks, Seaboard has some allegations against it. The two main allegations are one related to price manipulation and the second to its business operations in Cuba. Despite these risks, I still believe that Seaboard represents an excellent investment opportunity and thus stay with my Buy rating.</p>",

That is a huge difference.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, although it is a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVLT/income-statement\">consistently profitable</a> company over the last 10 quarters, this category of profitability is impacted by relatively low margins and also a trend forming where operating income has been on the decline in the last 3 quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58572054-1761891945352999.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"CVLT - op income\" width=\"379\" height=\"61\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"379\" data-height=\"61\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58572054-1761891945352999.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58572054-1761891945352999.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58572054-1761891945352999.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58572054-1761891945352999.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58572054-1761891945352999.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58572054-1761891945352999.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58572054-1761891945352999.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58572054-1761891945352999.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CVLT - op income <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the combined reasons above, I am giving it a low hold rating in this category.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance Sheet &amp; Credit Ratings: Elevated Leverage Risk, But A Highly Liquid Asset Base</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving beyond the income statement, here let's talk about the concept of balance sheet risk, or exposure to asset and liability risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For one thing, comparing debt in relation to equity, in my chart below you can see that Commvault has a D/E of 4.31, not only the highest in this peer group but also the trend line shows it has risen this year:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6d3c13f1f98c5287e51e9cc63ccfe4f4.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6d3c13f1f98c5287e51e9cc63ccfe4f4.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6d3c13f1f98c5287e51e9cc63ccfe4f4.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6d3c13f1f98c5287e51e9cc63ccfe4f4.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6d3c13f1f98c5287e51e9cc63ccfe4f4.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6d3c13f1f98c5287e51e9cc63ccfe4f4.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6d3c13f1f98c5287e51e9cc63ccfe4f4.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6d3c13f1f98c5287e51e9cc63ccfe4f4.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_6d3c13f1f98c5287e51e9cc63ccfe4f4.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A D/E of 4.3, especially if it an outlier in a peer group of similar businesses, may point to excessive leverage risk in this case, so that does not help this firm's overall rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When such a highly leveraged company has an earnings miss, it can cause jitters among investors, and as <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-commvault-systems-stock-plummeting-171200634.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yahoo!

Both are significantly above the sector averages.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because GAAP figures can include one-time expenses related to business acquisitions, and we know from earlier commentary that Commvault recently acquired a firm, it could skew the GAAP-based valuation multiple, so in this case let's use the non-GAAP multiple of 36x instead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using that, here is a worksheet I created comparing my future price target for this stock vs the target expected by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVLT/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">Wall St</a>:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58572054-17618948617625332.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"CVLT - price target worksheet\" width=\"514\" height=\"257\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"514\" data-height=\"257\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58572054-17618948617625332.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58572054-17618948617625332.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58572054-17618948617625332.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58572054-17618948617625332.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58572054-17618948617625332.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58572054-17618948617625332.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58572054-17618948617625332.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/58572054-17618948617625332.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CVLT - price target worksheet <span>(author worksheet)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the worksheet, we can visualize how my price target is $163.08, using the non-GAAP fwd earnings multiple and the March2027 consensus EPS estimate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVLT/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">Wall St avg target</a> is $194.70, significantly more optimistic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When averaging the two targets, I expect an avg. upside potential of +30% for this stock going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What we can learn from this section's data is that the market likely punished the stock temporarily for the quarterly earnings miss, yet still expects a lot of future value and earnings potential. Also, a 30% upside forecast to the last closing price adds justification to move the needle towards a buy rating, particularly to take advantage of this price dip.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, while some may call it a value trap and say the profit margins are low, others may point to the strong top-line growth potential and macro demand for data loss prevention as strong catalysts for this firm. Because of this mixed picture, I am inclined to give it an optimistic hold rating in this category, more cautious than Wall St.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Slightly Less Bullish Than Wall St</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In conclusion, although Wall st says this is a strong buy, I am slightly more cautious and giving it a buy, which is still an upgrade to my prior hold rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today's research has shown some key upside and downside factors, and the upside tips the needle into the buy column particularly driven by strong top-line growth potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A risk to my buy rating, not mentioned elsewhere in this article but that can pose a challenge, hits at the very nature of this type of business and that is it is supposed to protect valuable client data so therefore it is a prime target for cyber attacks, which could ultimately negatively impact its brand reputation if successfully executed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to the <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/05/22/advisory-update-cyber-threat-activity-targeting-commvaults-saas-cloud-application-metallic\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cybersecurity &amp; Infastructure Security Agency/CISA,</a> an official US government agency, last May an alert was issued:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Commvault is monitoring cyber threat activity targeting their applications hosted in their Microsoft Azure cloud environment.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A mitigating factor to such risks is proactive and multi-layer approaches to cybersecurity, something I have seen in large-enterprise IT teams I've worked in, but nevertheless from an investor perspective it is a potential risk that can impact future downside.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond that, however, my call to action today for readers is that this stock appears like a dip-buying opportunity to own a piece of the future of data loss prevention solutions, a critically necessary market particularly in our increasingly AI-driven economy.</p>",

Moreover, IMVT-1402 is a weekly subcutaneous injection that is designed for at-home administration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the external landscape across autoimmune conditions has materially changed. For instance, Johnson &amp; Johnson’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNJ\" title=\"Johnson &amp; Johnson\">JNJ</a>) Imaavy (another FcRn blocker) received <a href=\"https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-receives-fda-approval-for-imaavytm-nipocalimab-aahu-a-new-fcrn-blocker-offering-long-lasting-disease-control-in-the-broadest-population-of-people-living-with-generalized-myasthenia-gravis-gmg\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.jnj.com/media-center/press-releases/johnson-johnson-receives-fda-approval-for-imaavytm-nipocalimab-aahu-a-new-fcrn-blocker-offering-long-lasting-disease-control-in-the-broadest-population-of-people-living-with-generalized-myasthenia-gravis-gmg\" target=\"_blank\">FDA approval</a> in April 2025 for generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). Imaavy is administered by intravenous infusion every two weeks. The market leader in FcRN inhibition, argenx (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARGX\" title=\"argenx SE\">ARGX</a>), has been busy itself. Its flagship subcutaneous injection, Vyvgart Hytrulo, allows weekly self-injection (20-30 seconds). So, the onus on Immunovant’s IMVT-1402 is to show clear efficacy/remission superiority or offer materially better dosing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On Thursday, Immunovant’s stock rallied some 15% after an “uncooked” Betaville alert that the company attracted <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511412-immunovant-gains-amid-takeover-speculation\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511412-immunovant-gains-amid-takeover-speculation\" target=\"_blank\">takeover interest</a>.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_db43127d0638b909315a7b17faedcdc6.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_db43127d0638b909315a7b17faedcdc6.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_db43127d0638b909315a7b17faedcdc6.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_db43127d0638b909315a7b17faedcdc6.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_db43127d0638b909315a7b17faedcdc6.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_db43127d0638b909315a7b17faedcdc6.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_db43127d0638b909315a7b17faedcdc6.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_db43127d0638b909315a7b17faedcdc6.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_db43127d0638b909315a7b17faedcdc6.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The article that follows catches up with Immunovant’s IMVT-1402 and speculates on the takeover speculation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recent Developments</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Immunovant highlights (see <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_59469abe087b8aa5a7a6570f760e5ad6/immunovant/db/934/9390/pdf/IMVT_Master+Deck_8.7.25+vF.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_59469abe087b8aa5a7a6570f760e5ad6/immunovant/db/934/9390/pdf/IMVT_Master+Deck_8.7.25+vF.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Slides</a> 6 and 11) IMVT-1402’s “best-in-class IgG reductions” and convenient administration as key differentiators, but there are caveats with both claims.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217667079413_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1902\" data-height=\"1076\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217667079413_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Immunovant\" width=\"640\" height=\"362\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217667079413_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217667079413_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217667079413_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217667079413_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217667079413_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217667079413_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217667079413_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217667079413_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Immunovant</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As Immunovant subtly points out, the cross-trial comparison is apples to oranges.

The franchise is clearly anchored on IMVT-1402, with batoclimab predominantly acting as “John the Baptist.” Yes, Immunovant is readying batoclimab for the market (e.g., TED), but no one expects it to generate meaningful profit for the company. One <a href=\"https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/data-insights/batoclimab-immunovant-net-present-value/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/data-insights/batoclimab-immunovant-net-present-value/\" target=\"_blank\">source</a> has batoclimab generating $1.06 billion by 2038 at its peak. This may sound like a lot, but if you subtract for COGS and opex and discount the future cash flows, it’s not.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Immunovant is hopeful that IMVT-1402’s ≥70% IgG reduction will lead to higher responses/remissions to confer best-in-class status in crowded markets (gMG, CIPD) and first-in-class, or as Immunovant describes it, “nearly-first,” in less-served settings like GD, RA-D2T, and SjD.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is no shortage of catalysts for Immunovant:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217666955884_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1900\" data-height=\"1070\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217666955884_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Immunovant\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217666955884_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217666955884_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217666955884_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217666955884_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217666955884_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217666955884_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217666955884_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-17619217666955884_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Immunovant</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But its valuation will surely hinge on early proof that ≥70-80% IgG reductions (if it actually achieves this level) translate to remission durability and/or less frequent dosing. This is a tough ask.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, Immunovant’s enterprise value of $3.73 billion already implies a decent amount of success. Bear in mind that we do not yet have any patient efficacy data for IMVT-1402. Obviously, given its class, it is almost assumed to be safe, effective, and has, subsequently, quickly advanced to a few potentially registrational trials (GD, RA-D2T, MG, CIPD, etc.).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some of Immunovant’s peers have a similar valuation, but with successful products already on the market. ACADIA Pharmaceuticals (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACAD\" title=\"ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.\">ACAD</a>), for instance, trades at an EV of $3.13 billion despite generating <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4481031-acadia-raises-2025-nuplazid-guidance-to-665m-690m-as-daybue-accelerates-community-uptake\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4481031-acadia-raises-2025-nuplazid-guidance-to-665m-690m-as-daybue-accelerates-community-uptake\" target=\"_blank\">$264.6 million in total revenue</a> from Nuplazid and Daybue in Q2 alone. Obviously, valuations are never this simple, and Immunovant’s total addressable market is much larger than ACADIA’s. My point is that Immunovant’s valuation already implies some degree of market success.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Immunovant <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20195717-immunovant-provides-corporate-updates-and-reports-financial-results-for-the-quarter-ended#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20195717-immunovant-provides-corporate-updates-and-reports-financial-results-for-the-quarter-ended#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" target=\"_blank\">believes</a> its $598.9 million in cash (as of 6/30/25) will last through the 2027 GD readout. In its last quarter, Immunovant’s “cash burn” (cash from operations) was $117.4 million—not a trivial amount. So, the 2027 readout really creates a “make-it-or-break-it” moment for Immunovant: proof-of-concept data combined with a major financing overhang. Fortunately, investors have ~2 years to prepare for it.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">M&amp;A Speculation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding M&amp;A speculation, this is not the first time Immunovant has been subject to rumors. In my view, a Betaville “uncooked” alert is a low-confidence market rumor. It should be interpreted as “chatter” and not a “leak.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That being said, M&amp;A activity would not surprise me. The most likely suitor would be Immunovant’s parent company, Roivant (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROIV\" title=\"Roivant Sciences Ltd.\">ROIV</a>), which owns ~57% of Immunovant already. A take-private/squeeze-out is structurally feasible and would simplify decision-making across the FcRn franchise. It would also help consolidate IMVT-1402 economics and align trial prioritization with Roivant’s portfolio. On the other hand, Roivant already controls strategy without paying a premium.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Earnings Preview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Immunovant is slated to report its Q3 earnings on November 10. Here are the two main things I am looking for:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Updates on the six active studies (e.g., enrollment pace, timelines) and whether management shares any early patient signals or bridging biomarkers beyond healthy-volunteer IgG drops.</li> <li>Cash runway and burn trajectory to the GD readout (any shift to the \"runway through 2027 GD readout\" guidance, financing needs).</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I can see the appeal on both sides (bull and bear) for Immunovant. It is a high-risk, wide-dispersion bet that IMVT-1402 will convert deep IgG reductions (which is still an unknown) into durable, less-frequent dosing across multiple autoantibody diseases without the LDL/albumin penalties.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-1761921765945083_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1000\" data-height=\"800\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-1761921765945083_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" width=\"640\" height=\"512\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-1761921765945083_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-1761921765945083_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-1761921765945083_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-1761921765945083_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-1761921765945083_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-1761921765945083_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-1761921765945083_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48050289-1761921765945083_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Compilation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Until patient efficacy arrives (2026-2027), I think the downside is more likely.

The upside potential is tantalizing, but so is the risk. Hence, IMVT is best for a barbell portfolio, where investors allocate no more than what they can afford to lose.</p>",

During our update, the following chart caught our attention and led<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> us to rethink the classic notion of blue-chip safety, embodied by the Dow Jones Industrial Average, relative to assets that are perceived as “riskier,” such as the growth-oriented NASDAQ index. To wit, the chart shows the dividend yield spread ('YS') between the QQQ and DIA ETFs since the 2000s. The YS has been persistently negative over the long term, thanks to the Dow Jones index's focus on mature and blue-chip stocks, which in turn led to higher capital return to investors in the form of dividend payouts. DIA’s long-term average yield is a considerable 1.56% above that from QQQ.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, note that the YS, sitting at around -0.969%, is not only far above the historical average of -1.56% but also close to the peak level of -0.878% observed since ~2000. Such an elevated YS suggests to me that investors should not take DIA’s safety for granted under today’s market conditions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As will be elaborated next, such a YS brought Dow’s safety into question for several reasons. And the subsequent sections will detail the top two on my list: the protection role of blue-chips’ current yield and also Dow’s valuation risks when adjusted for growth.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1363\" data-height=\"827\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph with a line graph AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"388\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157686675_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dow’s dividend advantage is diminished</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As aforementioned, a large reason behind Dow’s reputation for safety is the mature status of its holdings, which allows them to pay out more generous dividends. A higher current yield, in turn, provides a thicker cushion against downturns. Admittedly, this is still the case now. As you can see from the following chart, DIA still provides the highest TTM yield in absolute terms compared against other indices. To wit, DIA’s current TTM dividend yield is 1.42%, followed by VOO and SPY’s 1.13% and 1.07%, respectively (proxies to the SP500), IWM’s 0.98% (proxy to small caps), and finally QQQ’s 0.45% (proxy to the NASDAQ index).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the dividend yield advantage of blue-chip stocks is quite diminished under today’s market, either by vertical or horizontal comparison. As a horizontal comparison and as just mentioned above, DIA’s dividend yield relative to QQQ is near the thinnest level since the 2000s, indicating its diminished yield and valuation advantage compared to more growth-oriented assets. As a vertical comparison, DIA’s current TTM dividend yield is 1.42%, which is about 19% below its 4-year average yield of 1.75%, as seen. Expanding the time horizon, the picture becomes even more concerning. As you can see from the second chart below, DIA’s current yield is not only far below its average in the past 20 years or so (about 2.07%) but also near the lowest levels in this period. The last time DIA’s yield dropped lower than the current level dates back to the peak of the dot-com bubble.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1536\" data-height=\"283\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph with numbers and symbols AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"118\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156843612_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1353\" data-height=\"481\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph of a stock market AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"228\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277157453177_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation risks adjusted for growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As another reflection of DIA’s risks, the table below shows my assessments of various indices’ valuation risks when adjusted by their growth potential. Here, I am using their dividend growth in the past 3 to 5 years to represent their growth rates under the assumption that dividend payouts reflect the true economic earnings of the underlying companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown in this table, the Dow Jones index has been suffering dampened growth in this period when compared to other market segments. DIA’s dividend growth was only about 2.5% CAGR in the past 3 years and about 2.84% CAGR in the past 5 years. In contrast, the “overall” market represented by VOO showed much faster growth rates, with a 3-year CAGR at 6.6% and a 5-year CAGR of 5.64%, roughly doubling the growth rates of DIA. The QQQ ETF has demonstrated even faster growth rates with a 3-year CAGR of 12.89% and a 5-year CAGR of 11.67%, more than quadrupling the growth rates of DIA.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result of the vast differences in their growth rates, DIA has the highest PEG ratio (P/E growth ratio) among all the indices tabulated, as seen. Note that the P/E ratios I used here were either taken from the funds’ web pages as of this writing or inferred based on their latest fund disclosures. DIA’s current P/E ratio is relatively low in absolute terms (at around 23.0x), only higher than IWM’s 18.4x. However, when based on the 3- and 5-year dividend growth rates, DIA’s PEG ratio is in the range of 8.1x to 9.1x, far above the PEG ratio from all other indices listed here. Note that QQQ, despite its highest P/E ratio of 44.3x in absolute terms, actually features the lowest PEG ratio of 3.4 to 3.8x thanks to its growth rates.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1537\" data-height=\"394\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A white paper with black text and numbers AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"164\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/54495410-17619277156893556_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other risks and final thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To recap, my skepticism about Dow's \"blue-chip safety\" when compared to other more growth-oriented assets (such as the NASDAQ, SP500, and small caps) is largely based on the yield spread and PEG ratios. A key counterargument and a limitation to my analysis involve its sensitivity to interest rate changes. The use of both yield spread and PEG ratios can be sensitive to the interest rate outlook. Either by a discounted dividend model or a discounted cash flow model, growth stocks (such as those held in NASDAQ) tend to be considered longer-duration assets than value stocks like those held under the Dow index. As such, growth stocks could suffer disproportionately when interest rates rise because their distant future dividends and earnings are discounted more aggressively. Judging by the language used in the latest <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251029a.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251029a.htm\" target=\"_blank\">FOMC statement</a> (released on Oct. 29 by the Fed) and the specific vote counts, it is very unclear to me which direction interest rates will go next.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To conclude, investors have good reasons to consider DJI and DIA as safer assets compared to other market segments more focused on growth stocks. However, I suggest investors reexamine these reasons under today’s market conditions. My examination has led me to question this traditional wisdom. I don’t believe DIA is safer judging by its current valuation risks relative to other market sectors either in terms of yield or growth-adjusted P/E. Actually, I see large odds for DIA (or DJI) to suffer a more severe correction than SPY and/or QQQ if/when the next significant market downturn occurs.</p>",

It took a bit of a dramatic pullback in recent sessions. Got a lot of people asking questions about gold. Can the rally continue? Are the fundamentals still there? Joining us now to discuss is Daniel Ghali, Senior Commodity Strategist with TD Securities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Daniel, great to have you back on the program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel Ghali:</strong> Yeah, of course. Thanks for having me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> You got the question, if not of the day, of the week, of the month, perhaps even the year. What is going on with gold, and what can we expect going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel Ghali:</strong> Yeah, [LAUGHS] I mean, that's a fantastic question. But the way that I would look at it is that, thus far, over the course of the entire bull market in gold, it's really not been a question of demand. It's been a question of trust.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And for this year in particular, trust in the US dollar, trust in US institutions has really been the factor that's been changing. How else can we explain this idea that stock markets are doing quite well, and credit markets are at their tights, and we're in a nascent bond market, and commodity prices are rising and gold prices are ripping? The common denominator is really the answer there, which is the US dollar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So this is another way of saying the debasement trade has really been the primary driver. And when I think about the next few months, I actually think that we could be nearing an inflection point for the debasement trade, which means that it can either be reinforced, or actually it can be challenged. What I'm specifically thinking about here is a few of the Supreme Court decisions that are on the docket between now and likely January of the new year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> We've had guests on the show, and I think maybe some of your colleagues, like Bart Melek, talking about the fact that you take a look at gold at these levels, can it go higher from here? Of course, it can. Can it go lower? Of course, it can. When you talk about all these different catalysts coming, is it very hard to peg gold at saying, we're going to get another sizable upleg or just sort of stay where we are?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel Ghali:</strong> Yeah I mean, the way I think about it is I think about it in terms of the flows. Who's buying and who's selling? And when you think about who has bought gold in the last, $700-800 rally, it's really been quite different than who has been buying gold over the course of the bull market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We see signs of extreme FOMO from several different cohorts, including discretionary traders or macro funds, and including systematic trend followers, who recently have been actually selling. Concerning to me is this idea that retail participants probably have their highest exposure in gold since at least 2011, which was another meaningful year for a pullback.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, from a positioning perspective, it's all lining up towards extremes. But some of the more structural drivers, such as central bank demand, remains strong but has been weakening year to date. The total number might still be elevated, but it's less elevated than the prior year, which is less elevated than the prior year, and so on and so forth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So you really needed those other cohorts to step in, and they have. Now that they have, the question is, can they be challenged? And I do think that between now and year end, a challenge is coming.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> Alright, challenge is coming in the gold space. We'll watch out for that one. You've been writing a lot about silver over the last little while, about the squeeze, about the unwind. What is going on right now with silver?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel Ghali:</strong> Yeah, I mean, the way we've been phrasing it to our clients is, the silver squeeze you can buy into. That's been premised on this idea that the freely available stockpile of silver sitting in London vaults has been declining. It's been declining as a function of a structural deficit. But that's also been accelerated by the threat of tariffs, which incentivized traders to move metal from London into the US earlier this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, over the course of this month, we've seen that climax. We've seen the structure of silver markets become so critically challenged that the price had to trade substantially higher in order to incentivize metal to come back into the system from unconventional sources. Now that that has occurred, we actually think that we're headed towards a silver flood.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And what I'm referring to there is what will probably end up being the single-largest wave of repletion of London silver inventories on record. Thus far, we think there's at least around 50 million ounces that has made its way back to London from the US, from China, and indeed from ETF liquidations. And that last bit is actually the most important because silver is typically seen as a Giffen good, meaning people buy more of it as the price rises.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The challenge now is that we've struggled to sustain a break above $50 an ounce, which is a psychological level. Because we've struggled to maintain a break above it, it might actually end up looking like a fail break, which is something that could change the psyche around silver as a Giffen good. People might sell because it didn't manage to sustain that breakout.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An ETF liquidation is equivalent to a direct addition to the free float as well. So that is, again, now becoming a self-reinforcing process to the downside, until such a time that there are less available inventories in the US and there are less available inventories in China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> How much downside should investors be bracing themselves for? As you said, struggle to stay above $50. It's about $48.65 on my screen right now. If you get that flood of silver, how much pressure could we see to the downside?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel Ghali:</strong> Well, I want to balance that answer because on the one hand, it's very hard to see a scenario outside of a deep recession where silver can trade at $30-35 an ounce again. On the other hand, most of the rally that we've seen in this last leg has been a function of a liquidity crisis, not of a demand surge, actually. By our accounts, the combined demand that pulled metal out of London was roughly the same size as it was in February 2024. And if you go back to your charts and look at how did silver prices look back then, you'd see that the price really didn't do all that much during that month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, this isn't a function of a huge wave of demand hitting silver markets and therefore the price is rising. It's a function of the fact that the market couldn't absorb what is a large but typical pace of demand over the course of the last month. That's now changing. So, in our view, we don't need silver prices to be as high as they are today or to continue to rise in order to draw in metal from unconventional sources anymore, which means the path is to the downside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> OK, so we covered off gold. We covered off silver. What's going on with copper?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel Ghali:</strong> Well, copper has a particularly virtuous cycle that is ongoing. Firstly, from a supply-demand perspective, we've become accustomed to large-scale mining disruptions over the last year. But it's increasingly apparent that the world can no longer absorb these kinds of typical but large mining disruptions, either.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So one large mine comes to mind recently that's had a very large disruption. And the market's assessment is that, while we expect it to have a surplus next year, that surplus is gone. It's likely going to be a deficit year again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But even further than that, what I think the market is currently missing is this idea that, because concentrate supply-- what comes out of the mines-- is becoming so challenged, this is actually the first year in several years where smelter output, the processing of it, which ends up delivering the units that are actually traded, the smelter capacity might actually decline as a function of the scarcity emanating through the supply chain. That is a directly positive impact on copper prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Separately, I'd say there's so much work that's been done on how much copper is going to be consumed by AI, and it is going to be significant. But another thing people are missing is how proximate this demand is. This isn't a 2030 story anymore. This is a 2026--</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> They want it now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Daniel Ghali:</strong> It's now, yeah, because data centers are being built as we speak. So 2026, 2027, even 2028, this is demand that is needed now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And further to that, we've not even really begun to consider how China will try to compete on data centers. Thus far, the US has really been leading the charge. But as you know, in the recent Five-Year Plan, AI has really been one of the focal points for Chinese policymakers. And so, depending on how they choose to compete, this could potentially even double the copper demand emanating from AI and data centers.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.moneytalkgo.com/video/gold-market-fundamentals-as-rally-takes-pause/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p>",
