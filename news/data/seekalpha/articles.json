That's probably not a surprise.</p> <p>After all, companies with shareholder-oriented cultures and strong fundamentals tend to reward<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> shareholders year in and year out.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And why not? It's easy to do so when earnings are steadily climbing higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, I'm looking for companies with many more years of earnings growth than decline (depending on the industry and the business cycle, at least 8 or 9 out of the last 10 years is preferable).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment-grade (BBB- and up from S&amp;P and Fitch or Baa3 or higher from Moody's) credit ratings from rating agencies are also what I'm seeking. That provides businesses with a low cost of capital, which can make it easier to sustain earnings growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I want to cover businesses trading at appealing valuations. This brings us to the subject of today, which is the human capital management solutions provider, Paychex (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PAYX\" title=\"Paychex, Inc.\">PAYX</a></span>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I last covered Paychex with a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4716161-paychex-a-reliable-buy-for-growing-dividend-checks-now\">buy rating in August 2024</a>, I thought it could realistically achieve high-single-digit annual adjusted diluted EPS growth. I also liked the company's financial positioning. Lastly, I estimated shares were modestly undervalued.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fast forward to now, and we're reiterating our buy rating. Paychex's acquisition of Paycor in April is going well thus far, which reinforces our growth projections. The company's leverage ratio is exceptional, too. Finally, shares are also arguably more discounted now than they were 14 months ago.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Paychex Is Executing At A High Level</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1451\" data-height=\"758\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Paychex's financial highlights for the fiscal first quarter ended August 31st, 2025.\" width=\"640\" height=\"334\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"334\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761661950453081_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Paychex Q1 2026 Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On September 30th, Paychex released its earnings report for the fiscal first quarter ended August 31st, 2025. The company's total revenue jumped 16.8% year-over-year to $1.54 billion in the quarter. For more context, that matched Seeking Alpha's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500166-paychex-non-gaap-eps-of-1_22-beats-by-0_02-revenue-of-1_54b-in-line\">analyst consensus</a> during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The driving force of this topline growth had to do with <a href=\"https://investor.paychex.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/791/paychex-completes-acquisition-of-paycor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paychex's acquisition of Paycor HCM</a> in April. The latter acquired the former for $4.1 billion. Strategically, this acquisition strengthened its competitive position upmarket by uniting the two to form an AI-enabled technology provider with top-notch service and advisory capabilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Digging deeper, Paychex's Management Solutions segment revenue soared 21% over the year-ago period to $1.16 billion for the first quarter. Of that amount, the company estimates that roughly 17% of the segment's topline growth was fueled by the aforementioned deal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to CFO Robert Schrader's opening remarks during the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4826950-paychex-inc-payx-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">Q1 2026 Earnings Call</a>, higher revenue per client played into this growth. This was made possible by improved price realization and increased product penetration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Paychex's PEO and Insurance Solutions increased by 3.1% year-over-year to $329.1 million in the first quarter. An uptick in the number of average PEO worksite employees was the primary driver of this topline growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interest on funds held for clients surged 26.9% over the year-ago period to $47.6 million. That mostly stemmed from higher average investment balances due to the Paycor acquisition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shifting gears to the bottom line, Paychex's adjusted diluted EPS grew by 5.2% over the year-ago period to $1.22 during the first quarter. That was $0.02 ahead of the analyst consensus for the quarter (the 19th quarter out of the last 20 it has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PAYX/earnings\">matched or exceeded</a> the analyst adjusted diluted EPS consensus). As the company was in the early stages of working Paycor into its business, its non-GAAP net profit margin contracted by 330 basis points to 28.6% in the quarter. This is why Paychex's adjusted diluted EPS growth lagged total revenue growth during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, the company should have plenty of growth ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's because Paychex's integration of Paycor is going well, with it set to exceed its initial cost synergy target of $90 million for FY 2026. The company is also pursuing incremental synergies beyond this target while reinvesting those gains for further growth and innovation investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the revenue synergy side of the equation, the integration has also been encouraging. President and CEO John Gibson noted that the company closed an ASO cross-sale to a Paycor client with several thousand employees. That was among the largest in Paychex's history.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For these reasons, we're inclined to think that the FAST Graphs analyst consensus is in the ballpark, if not a bit low. For FY 2026, adjusted diluted EPS is anticipated to rise by 9.8% to $5.47. In FY 2027, another 7.6% increase in adjusted diluted EPS to $5.89 is projected. For FY 2028, an additional 5.6% growth in adjusted diluted EPS is being predicted (this will likely rise as more analysts provide their forecasts for the fiscal year).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1450\" data-height=\"770\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A summary of Paychex's liquidity position and net leverage ratio as of August 31st, 2025.\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616620730019538_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Paychex Q1 2026 Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financially, Paychex is a financially sound enterprise. As of August 31st, 2025, the company's net leverage ratio was 1.2x. This is what earns Paychex a BBB+ S&amp;P credit rating with a stable outlook. That arguably sets it up to opportunistically execute what it views as complementary acquisitions (similar to Paycor) down the road (unless otherwise sourced or hyperlinked, all info in this subhead was according to <a href=\"https://investor.paychex.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/809/paychex-inc-reports-first-quarter-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paychex's Q1 2026 Earnings Press Release</a> and <a href=\"https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_3d71fd2564896520cc343e0da5538808/paychex/db/883/8146/investor_presentation/Q1+FY26+Investor+Slides+Final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paychex's Q1 2026 Earnings Presentation</a>).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fair Value Could Be Above $150 A Share</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1661\" data-height=\"835\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PAYX in FAST Graphs.\" width=\"640\" height=\"322\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"322\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-1761662120638762_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FAST Graphs, FactSet</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the last 14 months, shares of Paychex have only gained 1%. In our view, this modest performance only further enhances the stock's appeal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Paychex's shares are priced at a forward 12-month P/E ratio of 22. According to data from FAST Graphs, that's comfortably below the 10-year average P/E ratio of 27.9 (this was up incrementally from 27x as of August 2024).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving forward, we believe that a rational fair value P/E ratio for Paychex remains at around 27. What is our rationale?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, Paychex's profit margins are continuing to expand. The 28.6% non-GAAP net profit margin in Q1 2026 that we cited earlier is up significantly from 24.5% in <a href=\"https://investor.paychex.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/668/paychex-inc-reports-first-quarter-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q1 2021</a>. All else equal, a more profitable company supports our fair value P/E ratio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's more, Paychex's growth profile looks to be intact. For one, the FAST Graphs analyst consensus of $5.47 in adjusted diluted EPS for FY 2026 is higher than the consensus of $5.29 in August 2024. As is the consensus for FY 2027 of $5.89 for FY 2027 (it was $5.60 in FY 2026).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, the company's annual forward growth consensus is currently 7.3%. Considering that Paychex tends to beat adjusted diluted EPS expectations, this is comparable to the 10-year average annual growth rate of approximately 10%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of now, FY 2026 is about 41% complete. This leaves another 59% of FY 2026 and 41% of FY 2027 yet to come over the next 12 months. That produces a forward 12-month adjusted diluted EPS input of $5.64.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plugging this into our fair value P/E ratio of 27, we get a fair value of $152 a share. Relative to the current $124 share price (as of October 28th, 2025), this equates to a 19% discount to fair value. If Paychex matches growth forecasts and returns to fair value, it could generate a 27% total return by the end of November 2026. Through May 2031, it could post 13% annual total returns.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">More Strong Dividend Growth On The Horizon</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1541\" data-height=\"168\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PAYX in the Zen Research Terminal.\" width=\"640\" height=\"70\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"70\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/16583532-17616621364355063_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Dividend Kings' Zen Research Terminal</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Paychex's 3.5% forward dividend yield comes in well above the 1.5% median forward yield of the industrials sector and the 1.3% yield of the technology sector. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PAYX/dividends/yield\">Seeking Alpha's Quant System</a> groups the company in the industrials sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, it's arguably now more of a technology sector stock with its tech-driven HCM platform and recurring software as a service revenue profile. That's why we'll provide info for each sector, but we would consider technology to be the more appropriate classification. This sizable starting yield is enough for the Quant System to issue an A- grade for overall dividend yield (unchanged from August 2024).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Better yet, Paychex's outsized starting income looks to be secure. The company's adjusted diluted EPS payout ratio is expected to be in the high-70% to low-80% range for FY 2026. This is above the 60% payout ratio that rating agencies like to see from the industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the higher payout ratio is more stable than it may initially seem. That's because Paychex is a free cash flow machine, with the free cash flow payout ratio anticipated to be in the low- to mid-70% range in FY 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not to mention the very low net leverage ratio on the balance sheet. From our perspective, these elements support the current payout ratio. This backs up the Quant System's A- grade for overall dividend safety (also unchanged from August 2024).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's why we also believe that Paychex can sustain high-single-digit annual dividend growth over at least the next several years. This jives with the Quant System's forward annual dividend growth per share forecast of 8.8%. That would be well above the industrial sector median of 6.4% (and the tech median of 6.5%). This warrants a B grade from the Quant System for this particular metric (also unchanged from August 2024).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's why we're confident that Paychex can build on its 14-year dividend growth streak. This itself is already more established than the industrial sector median of 3 years (and the tech sector median of 2.1 years). That explains the Quant System's A grade for overall dividend consistency.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks To Consider</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Paychex is a business with robust fundamentals. Yet, some risks could undermine the investment thesis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I outlined 14 months ago, one key risk to Paychex is that it's effectively a United States pure play. In its FY 2025, ended in May, only about 1% of its total revenue was generated outside of the United States (per page 80 of 180 of <a href=\"https://investor.paychex.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0000950170-25-095300/0000950170-25-095300.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paychex's 10-K Filing</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, it will be critical for U.S. economic growth to continue to hold strong. This is most especially the case for small and medium-sized businesses in the country, since that is the company's core focus. Any particular challenges to these clients (e.g., slowing economic growth or rising inflation) could put a damper on Paychex's growth potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk to the company is the scores of sensitive client data on its IT networks. If this is compromised in any way, impacted parties could bring litigation against Paychex. The company could also be hit with penalties by regulators. These events could cause an exodus of existing clients and make it more difficult for Paychex to attract new clients.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary: A Blue-Chip Deal Worth Buying Now</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Paychex checks many boxes for us. As the company further incorporates Paycor into its business mix, adjusted diluted EPS growth should be in the high single digits over the next few years. The market-beating payout is also adequately covered by earnings and free cash flow, signaling the potential for further dividend growth. Paychex's net leverage ratio is also vigorous.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Clinching our buy case is the fact that shares are priced 19% under our fair value estimate. If Paychex lives up to growth expectations and reverts to our fair value, the stock could have an attractive 27% upside over the next 13 months. Over the next five and a half years, Paychex could put up 13% annual total returns. In closing, that's why we're maintaining our buy rating.</p>",

And while the Dividend King is a strong business<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and great long-term holding, their valuation appears a bit stretched, making them less appealing.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock is in the green in the past year compared to peer PepsiCo (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PEP\" title=\"PepsiCo, Inc.\">PEP</a>), which is down double digits. This is led by underperformance in their North American segments. And while KO has navigated current economic challenges better so far, their valuation seems more to do with investors flocking to safety because of economic uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this article, I discuss KO's latest earnings, fundamentals, and why I suggest investors looking to buy to wait for a potential pullback.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Previous Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I last covered The Coca-Cola Company back in February in an article titled: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4761426-coca-cola-strong-momentum-bullish-but-headwind-keeps-me-from-upgrading\"><em>Strong Momentum Is Bullish, But One Headwind Keeps Me From Upgrading. </em></a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the beverage giant has since experienced some volatility, the share price has remained relatively flat over the past 8 months. It is down close to 2%. The S&amp;P (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" class=\"ticker-link\">SP500</a>) has continued its upward trajectory, up 15.41%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2049\" data-height=\"928\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"290\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54869375-17617435951016781_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">KO's headwinds that kept me at a hold were their valuation, macroeconomic uncertainty, and cash flow issues. Their cash flow was impacted by their tax litigation lawsuit with the IRS that required a $6 billion deposit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Free cash flow was down 51%, with dividends exceeding (FCF) of $4.7 billion, bringing the payout ratio above 100%. But I did expect the dividend to remain safe despite temporary headwinds. Limited upside to their 2026 price target of $68.56 also kept me cautious as I suggested investors wait for a pullback near $60.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong Earnings Delivery</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As mentioned earlier, the beverage giant delivered <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4831463-the-coca-cola-company-ko-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">a strong Q3</a> and saw their share price rally as a result. EPS of $0.82 beat by $0.04, while revenue of $12.5 billion beat by $90 million, solid considering financially challenged consumers. Year-over-year, both grew 6% and 5%, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For comparison, PEP saw their bottom line decline slightly from $2.31 to $2.29, while revenue managed to increase modestly from $23.3 billion to $23.94 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PEP's performance in the past year has been impacted by performances in their North American segments. KO's performance was driven by a solid showing in their EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions, where they saw growth of 7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Bottling Investments, unit case volume grew 2%, up from the prior year's quarter, where it declined 31%. Activist investor Elliott Management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500105-eyes-on-pepsico-as-the-company-considers-a-refranchising-move\">recently took a $4 billion stake</a> in peer PEP, calling for the company to make strategic changes like KO with its bottling services, hoping to unlock value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far, the move by KO to battle declining volumes seems to have panned out. And Pepsi could soon follow in their footsteps. KO continued to grow market share for the 18th consecutive quarter, driven by their digital transformation efforts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During earnings, KO announced that in July, they sold a 40% stake in their Indian-owned bottler. This is expected to close sometime in 2026 and unlock growth opportunities in India and Africa. This is also another reason KO has outperformed PEP, as they seem to always be a few steps ahead.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margin Improvements</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Organic revenue growth was 6%, while global unit volume grew a modest 1%, up from a decline of 1% the year prior. However, organic revenue was lower than the previous year's 9%, a testament to the challenging economic backdrop. Margins also expanded as a result, with operating margins increasing from 30.7% to <strong>31.9%</strong>. Gross margins also expanded nearly 100 basis points from 60.7% to <strong>61.5%</strong>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1647\" data-height=\"1065\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"414\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611552586953592_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>KO IP</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Free Cash Flow &amp; Guidance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a dividend-focused investor, I'm typically more concerned with a company's free cash flow even if they're Dividend Kings like KO and PEP.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But in their recent quarter, cash flow improved to $2.4 billion, bringing this to $8.5 billion year-to-date, excluding the Fairlife payment. The previous year's quarter cash flows were impacted by the IRS litigation payment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a positive note, management raised FCF guidance, thanks to lower capital expenditures expected. Cash from operations is expected to amount to $12 billion, while FCF is expected to be $9.8 billion, up from $9.5 billion previously.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Organic revenue is still expected in a range of 5% to 6%, and EPS growth of 8%. Solid in comparison to Pepsi, who's expecting earnings to be flat from 2024's $8.16.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance Sheet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">KO's balance sheet was also in solid shape, with leverage well below their targeted range of 2.0x-2.5x at 1.8x. This, along with their A credit rating, gives the company flexibility should cash flows become impacted for any unforeseen reason, ensuring the dividend streak remains intact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1853\" data-height=\"801\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"277\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/22/54869375-17611568954830265_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>KO IP</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Coca-Cola Company has rallied since September, up close to 7%.

PEP appears to be the better buy. Although, they've also rallied in the past month.

Moreover, with job losses increasing, this could lead to weakness within their segments, particularly in North America. And should volumes pull back, a sell-off is likely to follow.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While The Coca-Cola Company remains one of the safest businesses, I believe macro uncertainty has led to investors flocking to safe-haven investments like KO. This limits upside and could result in underwhelming returns going forward. Although I like KO's timeless brand, their valuation keeps me at a hold.</p>",

These are the two key points relevant to investors:</p> <ol> <li>Trump aimed to confirm the committed DFI<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> investments into the US and claimed he secured up to </span><a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/trump-visits-south-korea-he-attempts-secure-billions-investment?msockid=342659ca3eb068631bc54d2d3fcc69a2\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">$22 trillion in investments by the end of his first year in office</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> in his speech in South Korea. Obviously, the US economic growth would accelerate next year if these investments were realized, but also inflation would increase as well.</span> </li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trump also met with the Chinese President Xi in South Korea, and they agreed to a broad 1-year truce, where part of the deal is a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/trump-cuts-fentanyl-tariffs-on-china-to-10percent-says-us-reached-rare-earths-deal-.html?msockid=342659ca3eb068631bc54d2d3fcc69a2\" rel=\"nofollow\">10% lower overall tariff</a> on imports from China, which reduces the overall inflation pressures, at least on margin. More importantly, a further tit-for-tat trade war escalation is now less likely, which reduces the overall macro uncertainty.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, on the surface, Trump's visit to East Asia has been successful, and the deals made are good for the US and the global economy - assuming that DFI commitments are actually realized and that the truce with China holds. However, there is considerable uncertainty whether these deals will hold.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The macro context</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trump's visit to East Asia was important within the geopolitical and the macroeconomic context.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Geopolitics</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From the geopolitical point of view, Trump's visit to East Asia was two-sided.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Trump met with the leaders of the key US geopolitical allies in the region, South Korea and Japan.</li> <li>However, Trump also met with the leader of the main geopolitical adversary, China, and narrowly avoided meeting the leader of another adversary, North Korea.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The State Department has a specific list of <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-15/subtitle-B/chapter-VII/subchapter-E/part-791/subpart-A/section-791.4\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"foreign adversaries\" 15 CFR 791.4: </a></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The People's Republic of China, including the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macau Special Administrative Region (China)</li> <li>Republic of Cuba (Cuba)</li> <li>Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran)</li> <li>Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea)</li> <li>Russian Federation (Russia) and</li> <li>Venezuelan politician Nicolás Maduro (Maduro Regime)</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On October 9th, China issued <a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/t0656_china_rare_earth_controls_2025_61_EN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">MOFCOM Notice No. 61.</a> in which it restricts the exports of rare earth materials for military use. Given that 1) China has nearly 90% control of global production and processing of rare earths, and 2) rare earths are essential in today's high-tech military equipment, China <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829908-us-china-trade-war-escalates-to-geopolitical-crisis\">escalated</a> the trade war to a major geopolitical situation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In response, Trump threatened an additional 100% tariff on China. It is also important to note that, just before the meeting with Xi, Trump announced that <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trump-appears-to-suggest-the-u-s-will-resume-testing-nuclear-weapons-for-first-time-in-30-years\" rel=\"nofollow\">the US will restart nuclear testing</a> on \"equal basis with Russia and China\".</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Economic growth</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trump's domestic economic plan is heavily dependent on foreign capital.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>First, tariffs are considered an important source of government revenue, used to offset the tax cuts in the Big Beautiful Bill.</li> <li>Second, Trump pledged to lower the reciprocal tariffs for the countries that commit to invest in the US - and this is expected to be the major source of growth from 2026 onwards.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, economically, for the US, it is important to formalize the committed foreign investments and to ensure their effective implementation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Deals with Japan and South Korea</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">South Korea pledged a $350 billion investment to get the reciprocal tariff on autos reduced from 25% to 15%, and that includes $200 billion in cash, paid in installments of up to $20 billion per year, and $150 billion directed toward the U.S. shipbuilding industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problem for South Korea is that $350 billion is 85% of its foreign exchange reserves. Thus, this investment will be very difficult and risky to implement. The US-South Korea deal does not specify how South Korea will raise funds to invest in the US. Thus, in my opinion, the actual implementation still remains uncertain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/10/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-brings-home-more-billion-dollar-deals-during-state-visit-to-the-republic-of-korea/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the list of all specific projects</a> agreed upon between the US and South Korea.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Japan pledged $550 billion to support U.S. industry and infrastructure and also to get the reciprocal tariff on autos reduced from 25% to 15%, out of which $332 billion is for critical energy infrastructure. Again, the problem is that such a large investment could strain the Japanese economy, since Japan would also commit public funds. No specifics were discussed in Japan about the source of funding for this DFI; thus, this investment also remains uncertain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/10/28195/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the list of all specific projects</a> agreed upon between the US and Japan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The bottom line:</strong> Trump's deals with Japan and South Korea specified DFI projects, but their actual implementation is still highly uncertain given that no information has been given about the source of DFI funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Separately, Trump signed the critical minerals agreement to 'further diversify the critical minerals supply chain' with Japan and the critical minerals access agreement with <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/10/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-secures-peace-and-prosperity-in-malaysia/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Malaysia</a>. This confirms the geopolitical aspect of the deals.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Deal with China</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China agreed to delay the implementation of the rare earth export ban for military use for one year - and that's the main outcome of the Trump-Xi meeting. Thus, the US now has a year to find alternative sources of rare earths, and it seems like the race is on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In return, Trump lowered the 20% fentanyl tariff down to 10%, which is not really a major concession. China also pledged to increase the purchases of soybeans, and both countries will start lowering trade barriers, such as port fees. Overall, these are minor concessions from both sides.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Market wanted to hear some positive news about Nvidia exports of Blackwell chips to China, but China seems to be on the path of self-reliance in high-tech, which supports the decoupling thesis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Implications</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Presidents Trump and Xi agreed to a temporary truce. However, the geopolitical situation remains tense, the US-Venezuela situation is escalating, the Russia-Ukraine war has no end in sight, and the fact that Trump invoked nuclear tests right before the meeting is also an escalation. Thus, there is uncertainty whether the truce will hold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The DFI investment is Trump's main plan for domestic growth, and tariffs are becoming an important part of government revenue. However, the Supreme Court will review the case in early November to decide whether the reciprocal tariffs are legal. If the Supreme Court upholds the lower court decision and rules against the Trump tariffs, the DFI pledges are unlikely to ever be implemented.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even if the Supreme Court rules in favor of tariffs, countries like Japan and South Korea will find it difficult to fully fund the pledged DFI. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty whether these DFI pledges will ever be fully implemented.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the Trump-Xi meeting and the deals with Japan and South Korea don't signal the return of globalization and free trade, which is what the market would want to hear.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global financial markets did not respond favorably to the outcome of the Trump-Xi meeting, with the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" class=\"ticker-link\">SP500</a>) falling by 1%, as the truce was already priced in. However, Gold (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLD\" title=\"SPDR® Gold Shares ETF\">GLD</a>) increased by almost 2%, which is the ultimate safe haven and, thus, the indicator of post-meeting uncertainty.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AUDC\" title=\"AudioCodes Ltd.\">AUDC</a></span>) in February of 2024, when we doubled down on our cautious stance (Hold rating) in the voice AI software-related Israeli company. Shares at the time looked like they were undergoing<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a bottoming pattern, as demonstrated by a crossover of the popular long-term MACD indicator just a few months previous. AUDC stock, as we see below, topped out in mid-2020, so it was tangible that buyers were finally stepping in, given the improved </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AUDC/valuation/metrics\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">valuation</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> on offer. Suffice it to say, although requiring more bullish evidence (primarily concerning growth rates, which would be revealed in earnings reports that followed), downside risk seemed limited in AUDC some 21 months ago.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, as we see below, AUDC stock failed to gain traction since then, with the stock actually losing approximately 17% in the process. From a technical standpoint, initially, it must be stated that the long-term death cross (crossing of the 10-month moving average beneath its 40-month average) in mid-2022 trumps any other technical indicator, including the long-term MACD. That moving-average death cross confirmed that AUDC entered a long-term bear market at that time. The opposing subsequent bullish MACD crossover can act as a precursor to a turnaround, but it should never be acted on solely, especially against the prevailing trend. Therefore, this is why, from an initial technical standpoint, we stood pat on our cautious stance 21 months ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"990\" data-height=\"1277\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AUDC Long-Term Technicals\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"826\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-1761815266994198_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AUDC Long-Term Technical Chart (<span></span>StockCharts)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings Continue to Disappoint</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a fundamental standpoint, AudioCodes' quarterly earnings results have been disappointing, with the company missing EPS expectations in five out of the last six quarters. Although the company's second-quarter revenues ($61.08 million) this year beat the consensus, GAAP earnings were barely profitable ($0.01), missing the estimate by $0.06 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Irrespective of the rise in revenues, both compared to Q2 last year and Q1 this year, operating profit ($2.6 million) and GAAP profit ($0.3 million) both trailed their quarterly counterparts by some margin. This really is the issue with AUDC in that approximately $1 million in tariff-related costs hit the income statement in Q2, with up to $4 million expected to be the full-year tariff-related figure before all is said and done.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tariffs Exacerbating Profitability Headwinds</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Suffice it to say, irrespective of AUDC's attractive valuation, it looks like tariff-related costs are only going to exacerbate the company's poor profitability trends and forward-looking growth rates alike, most likely suppressing share-price appreciation in the process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is why investors should not solely focus on the likes of AUDC's growing services revenues ($32.6 million in Q2), which will keep growing recurring revenue streams over time. When it boils down to it, AUDC needs much better top-line growth rates because positive fundamentals in certain parts of AUDC's business continue to be drowned out by elevated tariff-related costs and muted growth, all things remaining equal.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Internal Growth Engines Not Showing Up in Overall Numbers</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, with annual guidance remaining on hold due to ongoing uncertainty, the 6%+ Q2 growth, for example, in the <a href=\"https://www.uctoday.com/ccaas/audiocodes-voca-cic-now-supports-microsoft-teams-phone-extensibility/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microsoft Teams</a> business, is not enough, you feel, to change sentiment here. Furthermore, how much of the projected 40% growth in CX's <a href=\"https://www.stocktitan.net/news/AUDC/audio-codes-expands-voice-c-paa-s-offering-with-ai-vtqmyalnovkh.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Conversational AI</a> business next year will end up dropping to the bottom line? Moreover, whilst fresh certification approvals may open up connectivity with other platforms, how are we to gauge these developments when management fails to provide forward-looking annual visibility whilst growing its own controlled costs (SG&amp;A) in the process?</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses rose to $35 million, up from $32.5 million in the year-ago period. The higher expenses are primarily attributable to higher investments in marketing and sales resources as part of our conversational AI investment. As to the guidance, as mentioned in our previous quarter's discussion, we will postpone issuing a financial outlook until we have a better and clearer understanding of the resolution regarding tariff rates.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Expected Earnings Look Like More of the Same</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consensus for the third quarter (expected to be announced 11/4/2025) is expecting $0.01 in GAAP earnings on revenues of $60.8 million (1.2% expected growth). Again, we see here that these growth rates are not strong enough (GAAP earnings of $0.09 per share were reported in Q3 last year) when attempting to shift investor sentiment in earnest.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Discount Model</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, when we have a stock that is technically in a long-term bear market, has profitability headwinds, yet still pays a dividend, we like to run a dividend discount model to try and stamp an accurate valuation on the company. The formula we will use is the following</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/932120-17618235258163922.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Dividend Discount Model Formula\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Dividend Discount Model (<span></span>WallStreetMojo)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">where EDPS is 'Expected Dividend Per Share.' CCE denotes 'Cost Of Equity,' and DGR refers to AudioCodes' 'Dividend Growth Rate'.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To initially calculate AudioCodes' DGR, we multiply the company's GAAP retention ratio (21.74%) by its return on equity (7.32%). DGR = 1.59%. Therefore, we can state that our EDPS equals the current annual dividend ($0.40) multiplied by 1.0159 = $0.41 per share</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To calculate AUDC's cost of equity, we use the formula below. Cost of equity is denoted as the rate of return investors require from a long investment in AUDC. We will use the current US 10-year treasury yield as our risk-free rate (4.06%), volatility instrument beta comes in at 0.96, and '<a href=\"https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/ctryprem.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Equity Risk Premium</a>' (4.33%) (denotes minimum expected return on a long investment in AUDC).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cost of equity = Risk-Free Rate + (Beta) x (Equity Risk Premium)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cost of equity = 4.06 + (0.96)(4.33) = 8.22%</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, the fact that COE comes in higher than ROE demonstrates that value is not being created for shareholders but actually being destroyed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plugging all of our numbers into the dividend discount model above, we get</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Value of AUDC = $0.41 / 0.0822 - 0.0159 = $6.18 per share.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, to sum up, based on AUDC's struggling profitability, lack of annual guidance from management, and dividend discount model result, we are downgrading our rating in AUDC to a 'Sell' until further notice. Many times, binary events such as quarterly earnings reports have the potential to change sentiment for the better, but constrained profitability trends point to us that all the risk remains to the downside. We look forward to continued coverage.</p>",

While I really like the company a lot, the current valuation is a bit discouraging. The company has been growing fast and has a lot more room to<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> grow, both on the top line and the bottom line. However, the problem is that to justify buying at the current valuation, it would need to grow above 20% CAGR for ten years, and it requires a pretty high net margin of 18% in the tenth year. While I believe the company could hit those numbers, it's a scenario that's tough to pull off.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Company Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hesai is a Chinese leader in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lidar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lidar </a>(Light Detection and Ranging) technology. To analyze the whole business, we can break down its operations into three main markets. First, in the automotive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_driver-assistance_system\" rel=\"nofollow\">ADAS</a> (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems). They supply major global Chinese OEMs, helping them create advanced cruise control and semi-autonomous driving. Second, they're the leading provider of Lidar sensors required for fully automated vehicles (<a href=\"https://www.sae.org/news/blog/sae-levels-driving-automation-clarity-refinements\" rel=\"nofollow\">level 4</a>) used in both robotaxis and roboshuttles. Third, they're developing and supplying robotic and industrial applications, including warehousing, logistics, and mapping.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the <a href=\"https://investor.hesaitech.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hesai-group-reports-second-quarter-2025-unaudited-financial\" rel=\"noopener\">last quarter</a>, the company reported triple-digit Y/Y shipment growth, showing an impressive change over the last year. Plus, it's starting to show profitability, which is another bullish indicator worth highlighting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"862\" data-height=\"213\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"hesai key metrics\" width=\"640\" height=\"158\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-1761764948981201_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Key metrics <span>(Author's using company's fillings)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to <a href=\"https://www.hesaitech.com/lidar-industry-enters-mass-adoption-phase-hesai-remains-leader-in-global-market-share/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yole Group</a>, Hesai, despite maintaining dominance of the lidar automotive market, has dropped by 5% (500 basis points) between 2023 and 2024. It's important to note two aspects that create a lot of uncertainty regarding Hesai's market share and sales growth. First, the technological factor: any player could come up with a new technology and really threaten the sales and market share of everyone else. Second, given that ADAS and robotaxis are so sensitive, particularly due to the potential for hitting a pedestrian, the regulatory landscape is likely to shift rapidly in any direction. Therefore, we should be cautious when making sales and margin projections, especially when we consider the market share variations between Hesai and Huawei, as shown in the following chart.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://medias.yolegroup.com/uploads/2025/04/IMG-LIDAR-FOR-AUTOMOTIVE-2024-vs-2023-market-share_YG_Apr2025-1024x662.jpg\" alt=\"market share lidar hesai yole\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Yole Group</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the last few months clearly show a strong rebound. According to Gaishi Auto Research in August 2025, they held a 46% Automotive LiDAR <a href=\"https://www.itiger.com/news/1153102953\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">market share</a>, which is 1.5 times that of the second-ranked competitor and 2.4 times that of the third. The monthly installation volume has almost tripled since January, soaring from 33,485 units to 97,583 units. It's also worth noting that the bar is getting higher in the automotive industry; features once considered luxury are now becoming standard. For example, the Lidar sensors are now being called \"the invisible airbag.\"</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to <a href=\"https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-lidar-market\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mordor Intelligence</a>, the Lidar industry is expected to grow 18.85% until 2030. The main driver is the potential breakthrough of solid-state, less than $500 sensors for mid-tier models instead of premium ones, in other words, the potential acceleration of mass adoption of the LiDAR technology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In August, the company reported achieving a \"<a href=\"https://investor.hesaitech.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hesai-group-reports-second-quarter-2025-unaudited-financial\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">C-sample phase</a>\" for a top European OEM. In short, the \"A phase\" is about quick prototyping; the B phase focuses on functionality and final design. The C phase is about demonstrating the capability for high-volume quality required by the OEM. Then the D phase is the start of production. In other words, sales are going to be spiced up by expanding into Europe. Also, they announced a joint venture with Toyota based in China, with mass production beginning in 2026. In the domestic Chinese market, they led the creation of a \"<a href=\"https://www.codeofchina.com/standard/GBT45500-2025.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">standardization</a>\" of sensors, along with 50 other manufacturers, to accelerate the mass adoption of ADAS and lidar technologies. This has two advantages for Hesai: First, it could accelerate sales (through mass adoption), and second, it creates barriers to entry for small competitors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The robotics and \"physical AI\" segment can be framed as a call option, where the downside risk is somewhat limited to R&amp;D costs, but the upside has almost no ceiling given the vast range of potential applications ahead.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to valuation, it may be somewhat tricky for two reasons: First, the company is growing revenues fast at 38% TTM Y/Y in USD; and secondly, the margins are improving fast. In both cases, to approach valuation, it requires making assumptions in order to reach a figure and draw our conclusions about whether it is cheap, expensive, or fairly valued. Also, this is not done without a high level of uncertainty about the growth rate and the margin performance ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Revenues growth assumptions hesai\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"404\" height=\"501\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617523421442971.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Revenues growth assumptions <span>(Author's)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here, the first three years are projected in line with the analyst consensus estimates. However, even after doing that, the rates are very optimistic. For example, when Mordor Intelligence expects an 18% CAGR in the next 5 years, the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSAI/earnings/estimates\">analyst consensus</a> implied rate is 37% CAGR between 2025 and 2030. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">((2230/452)^(1/5))-1 = 37.60%</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my case, I decided to go for a more conservative approach, using the native Excel function to forecast. It's still on the upper end of the optimistic forecast, but more realistic. To reach such a figure, I'm assuming the company will be able to do two things. First, it will maintain its current market share (in relative terms), but on a \"bigger market\" (growing in absolute terms), when mid-tier vehicles would adopt Lidar technology in bulk. Second, I assume the company will have some success developing and commercializing new robotic models for industrial applications, outside of the automotive segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The following valuation model is based on 4 key variables: revenue growth, net margin at the tenth year, a P/E representative of fair value for this company, and cost of equity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I already discussed potential revenue growth. Regarding net margin, it is the most uncertain part of this, especially looking at the 10 years ahead. However, I'm modeling not only to \"project,\" but also to \"<a href=\"https://www.wallstreetprep.com/knowledge/reverse-dcf-model/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reverse value</a>\" the company - in other words, how much it needs to reach in net margin terms to justify the current valuation. As we see in the sensitivity analysis, Hesai will have to grow at a CAGR rate of around the 20s, combined with reaching a net margin of at least 18% in the tenth year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1302\" data-height=\"457\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"hesai fair valued cheap expensive\" width=\"640\" height=\"225\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/54308006-17617597818245826_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's assumptions</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding the P/E ratio, I just used 17x, which is the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSAI/valuation/metrics\">median</a> sector in SA. There are two sides here. The company may be significantly above the median discretionary sector because of its dominance and high level of innovation, but on the other hand, it is a Chinese company, which has additional risks compared to an American one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding the cost of equity, as I discussed in previous articles (especially in other Chinese companies, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4815623-qfin-holdings-poor-3q-2025-guidance-weakens-the-bullish-thesis\">such as</a> Qfin (QFIN)), I'm somewhat skeptical about the CAPM model. The Chinese <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/china/government-bond-yield\" rel=\"nofollow\">10y rate</a> now is at 1.75%; it doesn't make a lot of sense to discount to that rate, which translates into a measure of risk lower than an average US company. Instead, I used the US rate, so it resulted in something slightly above average, which I believe is more representative of Hesai.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While there are several risks to note, I will discuss the two I consider the most important: competition and political risks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to competition, despite their dominance in the market, there are other fierce competitors, such as Robosense (the main Chinese competitor), Luminar Technologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LAZR\" title=\"Luminar Technologies, Inc.\">LAZR</a>), Quanergy Systems (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QNGYQ\" title=\"Quanergy Systems, Inc.\">OTCPK:QNGYQ</a>), and Innoviz Technologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INVZ\" title=\"Innoviz Technologies Ltd.\">INVZ</a>). We should consider competition from three different perspectives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, Hesai's strategy is to lower prices in order to accelerate massive adoption; in that case, they would win not by a high margin but instead by high volume sold. However, the downside of this strategy is the potential price war that could erupt and really compress the company's profit margins. In a price war scenario, the companies with the most volume produced/sold will most likely survive, and the small ones will be hurt the most. So despite being somewhat bad, I believe it is not \"so bad\" for Hesai. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, they have a significant client concentration risk; losing only a few contracts/clients could show a substantial difference in total revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Third, because we're dealing with a relatively new technology, there is a significant level of uncertainty. A competitor could find a way to develop a superior product—one with better value for money—and really challenge Hesai.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding political risks, there are two to highlight. First, the Pentagon <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/pentagon-removes-lidar-maker-hesai-us-list-firms-alleged-help-beijings-military-2024-10-16/\" rel=\"noopener\">re-included Hesai</a> on its list of Chinese military companies. After Hesai filed an appeal, a U.S. District Court <a href=\"https://www.techinasia.com/news/us-court-keeps-chinese-lidar-maker-hesai-on-pentagon-blacklist\" rel=\"nofollow\">upheld</a> the decision of the Pentagon. I believe the company will be fine as long as they avoid colluding with the Chinese military, of course. Given that case, the Pentagon, Europe, and others will be a ceiling in revenues for this company. I don't think Hesai's management has the incentives for doing that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, there was the risk of delisting Chinese stocks by the U.S. government. However, this risk has lowered over time. Regarding these two issues, the company has been primarily listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In other words, the company achieved a <a href=\"https://www.hesaitech.com/hesai-successfully-listed-on-the-main-board-of-the-hong-kong-stock-exchange/\" rel=\"nofollow\">double primary listing</a> condition, and, therefore, its stocks are fungible. This means that, in the event of a US delisting, investors can easily convert their US-listed shares to the fungible shares traded in Hong Kong.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the last months, things changed for good for Hesai. First, the delisting risk from the US government (which was somewhat small) has been further lowered by the double-primary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Revenue in 2026 is highly likely to be spiced up by the European OEM, along with the joint venture with Toyota in China. Also, the potential in the robotics segment, while it's uncertain, is very appealing to me because the upside could be huge. From an <a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/management/ansoff-matrix/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Ansoff Matrix</a> point of view, this segment was a question mark, but if the trend continues, it appears that it will become the star segment. All this, of course, without taking anything away from the ADAS and robotaxis/roboshuttles segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding the risks, competition, the potential price war, and the political issues are somewhat manageable as of now. So, at first glance, it may not jeopardize the company. However, at the end of the day, the key metric for every company is forward earnings. From a reverse valuation point of view, the requirements of revenue growth and margins are pretty high at the current valuation. As for me, I'll wait on the sidelines for this great company; if there is a 20-30% drop in prices and no substantial change in the fundamentals, I will consider buying.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The company has been struggling to live up to its potential for years, posting<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> stagnant results, but shares still commanded premium valuation multiples in the meantime.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After a further fall earlier this year, shares traded at similar levels as January, yet valuations are still very demanding, even if the company returns to post historically high margins, all of which is making me very cautious.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">All About Machine Vision</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cognex has a mission to make advanced machine vision easy, which in itself is a hard thing to do. The company describes itself as the clear technology leader within advanced machine vision.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps this is best described by comparing the link between the human brain and eyes being applied to machines with optics taking the role of the brain and vision software the role of eyes. This allows machines to guide, identify, and inspect items in various industrial, logistics, and manufacturing environments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company employs about 3,000 workers, who generate just shy of a billion in revenues here, with the competitive positioning supported by nearly 1,500 patents issued and patents pending. In terms of geographical coverage, the business is extremely well diversified across the globe.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Automotive is a key end market, with other markets including logistics, electronics, packaging, and, to a smaller extent, semiconductor applications as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the 2010s, the company more or less tripled sales, with revenues just surpassing the billion mark in 2021. Revenues have been stagnant in the years thereafter due to overinvestments during Covid, more challenging macro conditions (certainly within automotive), and perhaps some execution issues as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The boom and subsequent period of stagnation have been seen in the share price as well. A $10 stock in the early 2010s saw shares peak around the $90 mark in 2021, but ever since, shares have come down to the $40 mark at the start of the year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gauging Expectations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the end, 2023 turned out to be a very tough year, with sales down 17% to $837 million, with adjusted earnings reported at just $0.73 per share. Following the announcement of Japanese-based Moritex and a recovery amidst easy comparables, growth was returning in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The full-year results for 2024 were not yet known in January, but it was fair to say that adjusted earnings for the year were only seen around $0.75 per share, flattish compared to 2023. With net cash holdings down to just over a dollar per share, a $40 stock at the start of the year commanded very premium valuation multiples, around 50 times earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In February of this year, Cognex <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/773500753/files/doc_earnings/2024/q4/earnings-result/cognex-press-release-q4-24.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> a 9% increase in 2024 sales to $915 million, in between organic growth reported and the contribution of Moritex. So far the good news is that adjusted earnings only rose by a penny to $0.74 per share, with margins lagging here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company failed to issue a full-year guidance for 2025 but only provided a guidance for the first quarter, with sales seen between $200 and $220 million, as EBITDA margins were seen between 12% and 15% of sales.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2025: Mixed Times</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hurt by some currency headwinds, first-quarter sales <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/773500753/files/doc_earnings/2025/q1/earnings-result/cognex-press-release-q1-25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">rose</a> by just 2% to $216 million, although margins were much stronger, with adjusted earnings up five cents to $0.16 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second quarter sales <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/773500753/files/doc_earnings/2025/q2/earnings-result/cognex-press-release-q2-25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">were</a> up 4% to $249 million as adjusted earnings of $0.25 per share look solid but rose by just two pennies on the year before. Over the summer, the company <a href=\"https://investor.cognex.com/news/news-details/2025/Cognex-Announces-New-Leadership-Team-to-Drive-Strategic-Growth-and-Innovation/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> a new leadership team under new CEO Matt Moschner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the ambitions, the company saw mixed results as activist investor Engaged Capital <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4506284-cognex-gains-after-activst-engaged-capital-reports-stake\">reported</a> a stake in the business in the fall, citing potential for huge upside in the shares, believing that new management could boost margins by 1000 basis points over time, in line with previous performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By the end of October, Cognex <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/773500753/files/doc_earnings/2025/q3/earnings-result/cognex-press-release-q3-25.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> an 18% increase in third-quarter sales to $277 million, yet the results benefited from a one-time contribution from a commercial partnership with a medical lab automation channel partner, with revenues otherwise up 13%. Adjusted earnings rose from twenty cents to $0.33 per share, or to $0.28 per share if we adjust for the commercial partnership.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Somewhat disappointing is that stronger momentum is set to slow down dramatically in the fourth quarter, which is surprising after the stronger momentum and new leadership being in place. Fourth quarter sales are seen between $230 and $245 million, suggesting a flattish to 7% increase in sales on an annual basis, with adjusted earnings of $0.19-$0.24 per share, largely in line with a $0.20 per share number reported in the final quarter of 2024.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Now?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares of Cognex fell from $47 to $40 upon the release of the results, with the fourth quarter outlook feeling a bit soft. Right now, realistic earnings are seen just shy of a dollar per share this year, a dramatic improvement from 2024 numbers, but still translating into demanding multiples around 40 times earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net cash holdings stand at $600 million, and with 170 million shares outstanding, net cash holdings stand around $3.50 per share. Down to the $40 mark, operating asset valuations stand at $36.50 per share, for a 37-38 times earnings multiple. Operating assets are here valued around $6.2 billion, and with sales seen close to a billion, sales multiples are seen around 6.5 times sales here. In part to undoubtedly please investors, the dividend was hiked by 6%, now payable at $0.32 per share each year, for a yield below a percent here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In between all this, Cognex has seen somewhat of a more resilient performance in 2025. While revenue and earnings growth is seen, and valuation multiples have come in, overall valuations remain very demanding. The risk-reward proposition still is not looking too favorable here despite long-term drivers in place related to labor shortages, inflation, and the need for automation, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At its peak, Cognex managed to post operating margins around 30% of sales. If that happens on a current one billion revenue base, after-tax earnings could come in around a quarter of a billion, equal to earnings around $1.50 per share.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even if this becomes a reality, it still is hard to justify the current valuations of the operating assets at a mid-twenty times earnings multiple. All this makes me continue to bark at current valuations, even if down over half from the highs in a post-pandemic environment.</p>",

Unfortunately, CoreWeave slumped following the deal agreement, in part due to taking on the debt of the data center projects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The deal has a fixed exchange ratio of 0.1235 shares of CoreWeave for each Core Scientific share. The shareholder vote is on October 30 and based on the current price, Core Scientific shareholders would only get $16.67 per share while the stock has already rallied to over $20 on speculation that the deal will get blocked.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CoreWeave has slumped from ~$160 prior to the deal to only $135 now.

CoreWeave added a $6.5 billion deal with OpenAI and a massive <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500180-coreweave-pops-amid-new-14b-deal-with-meta-for-ai-power\">$14.2 billion deal</a> with Meta Platforms, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), both of which indicate Core Scientific could land an expanded contract.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While approval of the deal could release CoreWeave to trade higher and provide more value to Core Scientific shareholders, the best solution is probably to just cancel the merger and let the stock prices adjust to market values. After all, both IREN and TeraWulf have tripled since July 7.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key investor takeaway is that the timing of the CoreWeave planned acquisition of Core Scientific didn't make a lot of sense. With CoreWeave facing a major lock-up expiration right after the deal announcement and the natural distraction from the major AI data center growth opportunity, the stocks haven't performed well during this period.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Core Scientific has already rallied into the shareholder vote on October 30, but the stock would appear to have more upside. Not to mention, the company appears past due for additional contracts that would juice the stock.</p>",

It also provided a tailwind for the convertible market, where issuers tend to be small- and mid-cap focused companies. This cohort stands to benefit as equity market leadership broadens beyond mega-cap technology stocks—a development we believe represents a significant opportunity, supported by both fundamental momentum and the historical benefits of rate-cutting cycles for these types of companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, we anticipate continued pro-growth fiscal policies combined with a data-dependent but increasingly accommodative monetary policy framework. Markets have advanced strongly from the tariff-induced concerns earlier in the year and may experience periods of volatility into year-end as investors debate the magnitude of recent gains. Nevertheless, we believe risk assets can continue to benefit from strong fundamental momentum across our core investment themes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The hybrid structure of convertible securities—combining equity-like growth potential with bond-like risk-mitigation characteristics—offers an attractive risk-reward proposition in this environment. We believe active management remains essential, as each convertible security offers unique structural features that can evolve over time, making disciplined security selection and ongoing portfolio management critical to optimizing return profiles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jon Vacko, CFA</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>SVP and Senior Co-Portfolio Manager</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Joe Wysocki, CFA</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>SVP and Senior Co-Portfolio Manager</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">October 2, 2025</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Market Environment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The strong equity market performance in the third quarter contributed to convertibles with the most equity sensitivity (+11.5%), outperforming convertibles with total-return attributes (+10.4%) and those with the most bond sensitivity (+5.1%). At the end of the quarter, convertibles with total-return attributes (39% of the market) exceeded convertibles with the most bond sensitivity (35%) and equity-sensitive attributes (26%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All economic sectors within the US convertible market delivered positive results in the third quarter. Leading sectors included materials (+50.6%), real estate (+21.3%), and industrials (+21.2%). The sectors that lagged the index by the most included consumer staples (+1.0%), communication services (+3.0%), and financials (+3.9%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unrated convertibles (+10.1%) outperformed speculative-grade rated (+5.7%) and investment-grade rated (+4.6%) issues. According to ICE BofA, roughly 79% of the US convertible market was unrated on average at the end of the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global new convertible issuance totaled $54.4 billion in the third quarter. It represented one of the most robust third-quarter volumes in recent memory, catapulting the year-to-date total above $125 billion. This strength reflects how companies strategically use convertibles as a cost-effective tool for capitalizing on growth opportunities and refinancing other forms of debt. We expect this favorable issuance environment to persist into year-end and beyond.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance Review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the quarter ended September 30, 2025, the fund (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CICVX\" title=\"Calamos Convertible Fund Institutional Class\">CICVX</a></span>) returned 9.11% (Class I shares at NAV) versus the ICE BofA All US Convertibles Index return of 8.58%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Positive Influences on Performance</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Information Technology</strong>. The fund’s leading security selection in information technology helped buoy relative performance. Technology hardware, storage &amp; peripherals notably helped, as did communications equipment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Consumer Discretionary</strong>. Favorable security selection and an average underweight position in consumer discretionary added to returns, especially in the broadline retail and homefurnishing retail industries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Negative Influences on Performance</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Real Estate</strong>. Security selection and an average underweight allocation within the real estate sector weakened returns. Specifically, data center REITs and our lack of exposure to real estate services held back relative results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Communication Services</strong>. Security selection and an average overweight position in communication services lost ground on a relative basis, specifically in the movies &amp; entertainment and alternative carriers industries.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Holdings - Contributors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bloom Energy Corp.

Its flagship product, the Bloom Energy Server, converts fuels like natural gas, biogas, or hydrogen into electricity through an efficient electrochemical process without combustion. The company serves customers in healthcare, data centers, manufacturing, and utilities with reliable, low-emission energy technologies. Bloom Energy was incorporated in 2001 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Analysis:</strong> Bloom Energy’s stock and convertible securities advanced significantly during the quarter, driven by surging demand for its fuel cell technology to power AI data centers, as highlighted by its major partnership with Oracle. Additionally, bullish analyst upgrades and price target hikes—some more than doubling prior estimates—fueled investor enthusiasm, while strong Q2 earnings and revenue growth reinforced confidence in the company’s operational momentum. We view Bloom Energy as a rapidly scaling clean energy leader, combining upside exposure to AI-driven power demand and hydrogen innovation with downside protection through its fixed-income characteristics of its convertible, which offers the opportunity to participate in Bloom Energy’s common stock with a favorable yield advantage over the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Western Digital Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WDC\" title=\"Western Digital Corporation\">WDC</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">3.00% Convertible due 2028 | 1.8% of fund as of 09/30/25</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Profile:</strong> Western Digital Corporation is a leading global provider of data storage solutions, specializing in hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and flash-based memory products. The company designs and manufactures devices used in everything from personal computing and mobile devices to data centers and enterprise infrastructure. It was founded in 1970 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Analysis:</strong> Western Digital’s stock and convertible securities advanced during the quarter, fueled by surging demand for AI and cloud storage infrastructure, which drove strong revenue growth and margin expansion. The rally was further supported by bullish analyst upgrades, a strategic HDD-Flash business split (Sandisk), debt reduction, and shareholder-friendly actions like buybacks and dividends. Western Digital is now a pure-play hard disk drive provider following the separation of its Flash business, allowing for a more focused strategy and streamlined operations. Its leadership in advanced UltraSMR technology and an aggressive product roadmap position it to benefit from accelerating AI-driven infrastructure and storage demand growth. Western Digital’s balance sheet is improving, and the convertible offers participation in the underlying stock tied to accelerating AI and cloud storage demand with a favorable yield advantage compared to the stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Holdings - Detractors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strategy Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSTR\" title=\"Strategy Inc\">MSTR</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">0.00% Convertible due 2030 | 2.4% of fund as of 09/30/25 0.875% Convertible due 2031 | 1.3% of fund as of 08/31/25</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Profile:</strong> Strategy Inc., together with its subsidiaries, advances bitcoin Treasury related strategies that provide varying degrees of economic exposure to cryptocurrency. In addition, the company provides artificial intelligence-powered enterprise analytics software and services globally. It was incorporated in 1989 and is headquartered in Tysons Corner, Virginia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Analysis:</strong> During the quarter, Strategy Inc.’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSTR\" title=\"Strategy Inc\">MSTR</a>) stock and convertibles declined partly due to investor debate around the company’s leverage and dilution risk. Additionally, Bitcoin experienced a period of consolidation after strong gains in the prior quarter. Despite this, the company continued to successfully access the capital markets with its fourth, and largest, preferred security issuance this year. We view investing in the convertible bonds issued by Strategy Inc. as a means of participating in the potential equity upside with measured downside risk and hold a favorable view on their positioning within the overall capital structure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Axon Enterprise (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXON\" title=\"Axon Enterprise, Inc.\">AXON</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">0.25% Convertible due 2027 | 0.8% of 08/31/25</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Profile:</strong> Axon Enterprise, Inc. is a public safety technology company that develops and sells conducted energy weapons under the TASER brand, along with body cameras, in-car video systems, and cloud-based digital evidence management platforms. Axon serves law enforcement, military, corrections, and private security agencies across more than 100 countries. Its mission is to protect life and accelerate justice through a connected ecosystem of hardware and software solutions designed to enhance transparency, accountability, and operational efficiency. Axon Enterprise was incorporated in 1993 and is headquartered in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Analysis:</strong> Axon Enterprise’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AXON\" title=\"Axon Enterprise, Inc.\">AXON</a>) stock and convertible securities declined during the quarter, primarily due to some investor concerns over its acquisition of Prepared, an AI-powered 911 communications company, which raised questions about the acquisition’s fit, the price paid, and the revenue impact, none of which were disclosed. We maintain a constructive view on AXON given its dominant position in TASERs and the fact that it has transformed itself from a TASER-focused business into a differentiated provider of integrated public safety hardware, software, and services with high and growing recurring/subscription/software as a source of revenues. AXON sells into a large and growing market, and its strategy is to further embed customers into the AXON ecosystem through cross-selling body/fleet cameras. As AXON continues this mix shift into software and services, and increasingly incorporates AI into its products, its installed base, margins, and free cash flow should continue to rapidly increase. The convertible offers an opportunity to participate in any continued upside in AXON stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positioning and Portfolio Changes</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our portfolio positioning remains focused on companies poised to benefit from transformative secular and cyclical trends. The AI-related theme continues to be among the strongest across capital markets, impacting virtually every economic sector. These opportunities also align with America-First fiscal policies aimed at rebuilding domestic infrastructure and promoting technology leadership. We continue to selectively identify attractive beneficiaries of these themes, and we believe our strategy of leveraging convertibles to pursue asymmetric payoff profiles (i.e., more exposure to equity market upside than downside) is particularly appropriate for the current environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding economic sectors, the largest portfolio weights are in information technology and industrials on an absolute basis. Conversely, consumer staples and energy represent the smallest absolute sector weights with holdings. On a relative basis, the largest industry overweight positions are systems software and movies &amp; entertainment. The financials and health care sectors constitute the most significant relative underweights. With respect to these sectors, consumer finance and health care equipment are among the underweight industries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Allocations to industrials and energy rose during the period with increased weights in heavy electrical equipment and coal &amp; consumable fuels. By contrast, allocations to communication services and health care decreased over the period with reductions to movies &amp; entertainment and health care equipment.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p>For additional information or to download a fact sheet, please visit the fund’s profile page:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.calamos.com/funds/mutual/convertible-cicvx/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> CICVX - Convertible Mutual Fund | Calamos Investments</a></p> <p><em><strong>Before investing carefully consider the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses.

The rally reflects investor confidence in the company’s expanding aerospace and defense sales<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and execution on its margin expansion strategy. With Ducommun positioned as a Tier 1 supplier benefiting from both defense spending tailwinds and the commercial aerospace recovery, I believe now is an ideal time to reassess the upside potential.

The Commercial aerospace market accounts for 40% of sales while military &amp; space accounts for 57% of sales. Another 3% of the revenues is generated in the industrial markets, but with 97% of sales in the aerospace and defense segment it is a near pure-play aerospace and defense company. The company has content on major commercial airplane programs such as The Boeing Company's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BA\" title=\"The Boeing Company\">BA</a>) Boeing 737, Boeing 787 and Airbus SE's <span>(</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EADSF\" title=\"Airbus SE\">OTCPK:EADSF</a><span>) </span>Airbus A320 and Airbus A220. Production ramp-ups are not necessarily smooth, and we have seen the ramp-up trajectory being delayed for several programs. Most recently, Airbus <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airbus-delays-some-a220-output-narrowing-window-reach-2026-target-2025-10-27/\" rel=\"nofollow\">pushed back</a> the ramp-up schedule for the Airbus A220. However, the clear growth driver is higher production rates as seen on the Boeing 737 MAX, Airbus A320neo and Boeing 787 program and all of those programs have a significant ramp-up schedule ahead. The company can <span>also </span>count the major manufacturers of business jets among its customers such as Bombardier Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BDRAF\" title=\"Bombardier Inc.\">OTCQX:BDRAF</a>) and Gulfstream, which is part of General Dynamics Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GD\" title=\"General Dynamics Corporation\">GD</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the defense segment, the company has again Airbus, Boeing and General Dynamics as its customers, but also other names such as General Atomics, Lockheed Martin Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMT\" title=\"Lockheed Martin Corporation\">LMT</a>), RTX Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RTX\" title=\"RTX Corporation\">RTX</a>) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NOC\" title=\"Northrop Grumman Corporation\">NOC</a>) as the company provides solutions for missiles, radars, drones, fighter jets, bombers, war ships and submarines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company does face some transient pressures as OEM destock on balked production ramp-ups, but overall there is a rather positive growth outlook for the company driven by both of its end markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company gets 55% of its sales from electronic systems, which I believe are becoming increasingly more critical for defense markets and 45% comes from aerostructures. Besides revenue growth opportunities, Ducommun is also working on expanding its margins beyond improved operating leverage. The company has shut down facilities in Monrovia and Berryville, which should drive $11-$13 million in annual savings as the company concentrates production in New York and opts for a low-cost footprint expansion in Mexico. Additionally, the company has targeted 25% of revenue to be generated from engineered products, which should come at better margins and higher aftermarket sales. The company is also tracking well on that. Engineered Product sales grew from 9% of sales in 2022 to 23% in 2024 with a target of 25% in 2027.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Limited Tariff Problems For Ducommun</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1301\" data-height=\"732\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"This image shows the Ducommun sales and manufacturing exposure.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393792808237_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ducommun</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a facility in Mexico, it is also important to assess the risk and the reality is that the risk is manageable. That is because Mexico represents less than 5% of the manufacturing footprint and sales are highly concentrated in the US with 85% of all sales going to the US distantly followed by 7% for Europe, China at less than 3% and Mexico and Canada representing less than 2% of sales. We also note that aerospace and defense products tend to be excluded from tariffs by default and USMCA compliance can be leveraged to avoid tariffs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wall Street Expectations For Ducommun In Q3 2025</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ducommun will report Q3 2025 earnings on the 6<sup>th</sup> of November. The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DCO/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly\">consensus estimate</a> on revenues is $211.9 million indicating 5.2% growth and earnings per share of $0.95 indicating a 3.8% decline likely reflecting some of the transient pressures I mentioned earlier. The estimated range on revenues is $211.3-$212.3 million and for EPS it is $0.89-$1.01. We note that there have been no major revisions over the past three and six months for revenues, but estimates on EPS have come down by 11% over the past three months and 6.9% over the past six months. The company does not have a perfect track record of beating Wall Street estimates. Over the past two years, the company missed estimates on revenues once and twice on EPS.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ducommun Has Significant Upside Ahead</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To determine multi-year price targets, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/checkout/mp_1087?avoid_pp=true#hasComeFromMpArticle=true#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\">The Aerospace Forum</a> has developed a stock screener that uses a combination of analyst consensus on EBITDA, cash flows and the most recent balance sheet data.

That easy upside was the simple fact that the company was trading at levels that did not value the expected earnings in 2025 or the realized earnings in 2025. At current prices, the stock is more or less fairly valued for 2025 earnings. As we are heading into 2026, I believe we should look at the earnings for 2026 which provide a $112 price target indicating 19% upside. I feel that it is still justified to maintain a strong buy rating as I typically set stock price targets based on earnings a year ahead and as we head into 2026, we normally are looking at target levels for 2027. For Ducommun, even without doing that we see upside and the stock is substantially undervalued against peers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On EBITDA estimates, there have been no major changes. For this year, estimates rose 1.4% and for 2026 by 2.6% and a small reduction in expectations of 0.4% in 2027. This provides a total uplift in EBITDA between 2025 and 2027 of 1.3% and a slight CAGR contraction measured from 2024 from 13.7% to 13.5%. On free cash flow, we see a 6.5% upward revision for 2025, but it's down 1.6% in 2026 and 10% in 2027. That is a total reduction to the estimates of 4.6%, but CAGR still stands at 54.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2305\" data-height=\"1309\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"This image shows the key metrics for Ducommun by The Aerospace Forum.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"363\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9932311-17618393798638866_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Aerospace Forum</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we look at the key metric, we see a promising trajectory. Sales are expected to grow 6.5% annually, but perhaps more importantly, EBITDA margins are expected to improve substantially from 13.4% to 18% by 2027. We also see better cash conversion and capital expenditures as a percentage of operating cash flow coming down substantially. The company should be able to bring down its debt substantially and by 2027, the leverage should come down substantially. The company does not pay a dividend and it also does not repurchase shares but with a healthy leverage it could opt to return cash to shareholders. Currently, that is not baked into my estimates but we do see a substantial improvement in the financials that could enable it.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Ducommun Remains Attractive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that Ducommun remains attractive. We note that there may be some transient pressures driven by delayed production ramp-ups and facilities going through learning curves. However, we see strong end market growth in commercial aerospace and defense that the company serves through aerostructure and microelectronics. In my view, that is a very nice business to be active in right now and Ducommun is a supplier to almost all original equipment manufacturers in aerospace and defense which provides them with a wide array of growth platforms for which growing demand could lead to potential outsourcing of work to Ducommun and the company has increased its focus on engineered products which come with less competition and actually no competition since Ducommun owns the IP rights and higher margins. So, I remain positive on the company’s prospects going into 2026 and reiterate my strong buy rating.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Revenues are projected to rise another 3 to 4<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> percent in 2025, showing the continued strength of a sector that grows even as broader media habits shift. What drives this momentum is accessibility, digital connectivity, and cultural ubiquity. Gaming today spans generations, with nearly half of players identifying as female and a rising share of older adults now playing weekly. It is no longer just a pastime; it has become a primary channel for entertainment, creativity, and social interaction.</span></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">It’s Not Just Kids Playing Video Games</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/fe641a483cde4f03942461c0dc5a758c/6350_espo-blog-charts_chart-1_2025-10_v1_blog.svg\" alt=\"It's Not Just Kids Playing Video Games\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: theesa.com as of 02.2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, the gaming business model has matured. Mobile now accounts for about half of global industry revenues, and in-game spending has become the dominant source of monetization. The shift from one-time purchases to ongoing digital transactions has created more predictable revenue streams and stronger engagement cycles. As studios continue to extend the lifespan of popular titles through updates, expansions, and live events, gaming has become a recurring digital economy rather than a series of standalone releases.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">In-App Purchases Are a Material Driver of Revenues</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/32286833de3e4a9b9d4246baabc0a431/6350_espo-blog-charts_chart-2_2025-10_v1.svg\" alt=\"In-App Purchases Are a Material Driver of Revenues\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Statista, as of 06.2025.

Over the past year, strong results from Nintendo, Roblox, and NetEase show how publishers are finding new ways to expand engagement and monetize their audiences. AppLovin was a standout contributor, as its AI-driven ad platform helped developers optimize user acquisition and improve profitability. Tencent also added to returns through steady performance across its global gaming operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some of these names, including AppLovin, Tencent, and AMD, are no longer part of the index due to ESPO’s strict requirement that at least half of company revenue come from gaming and esports. This approach ensures exposure stays pure and aligns with the industry’s long-term growth drivers, not broader tech trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key themes behind performance include:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Expansion of mobile and in-game revenue models supporting recurring growth.</li> <li>Strong content pipelines from global publishers extending franchise longevity.</li> <li>Increased use of AI tools in development, marketing, and player engagement.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AI Acceleration Moment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Artificial intelligence is emerging as the next major catalyst for gaming. In his recent appearance on the Thoughtful Money podcast, VanEck CEO Jan van Eck discussed how <a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/blogs/investment-outlook/jan-van-eck-q4-2025-outlook-escaping-the-reckoning/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\" title=\"Q4 2025 Outlook: Escaping the Reckoning?\">AI may be undervalued</a> by markets when it comes to creative industries. He noted that the leveraged buyout of Electronic Arts highlights how investors may be missing the intersection between AI and gaming’s potential for innovation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gaming companies are poised to embrace AI faster than many other industries because experimentation and rapid iteration are already central to their culture. AI streamlines every layer of the value chain, from how games are made, to how they are played, to how they are marketed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Developers are using AI to build and test new worlds in days instead of months. Gameplay is becoming more adaptive, with storylines and NPCs that respond to player behavior. Studios are marketing smarter, using data to target players and personalize content. Together, these advances are reshaping production cycles, improving engagement, and expanding profitability potential across the ecosystem.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI Game Developers are Adopting AI Tools in All Aspects of Development</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.vaneck.com/contentassets/7ea254e910a340fa9a339851ce013e5b/6350_espo-blog-charts_chart-3_2025-10_v1_blog.svg\" alt=\"AI Game Developers are Adopting AI Tools in All Aspects of Development\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Konvoy, as of 2025. For illustrative purposes only.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gaming’s New Playbook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The intersection of gaming and AI represents one of the most compelling growth frontiers in digital media. As AI tools lower production costs, enhance storytelling, and deepen engagement, gaming is positioned to remain one of the most globally connected and innovative industries. Leadership within the space will evolve, but the underlying growth drivers, including scalable intellectual property, recurring digital revenues, and expanding player engagement, remain firmly intact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The VanEck ESPO ETF captures this evolution through a focused portfolio of companies at the heart of the video gaming and esports ecosystem. By maintaining strict inclusion criteria and global diversification, it offers exposure to a sector that is not only growing but redefining how entertainment, technology, and digital identity intersect.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Approaching the Video Gaming and eSports Opportunity</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For investors, gaining exposure to this fast-changing sector requires focus. The video gaming and esports industry spans publishers, hardware manufacturers, and software platforms that directly generate revenue from interactive entertainment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The VanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF tracks the MVIS Global Video Gaming and eSports Index, which includes companies deriving at least 50 percent of revenue from gaming and esports-related activities. This rule ensures that the portfolio remains centered on companies truly driving industry growth rather than broader tech conglomerates with peripheral exposure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By combining exposure across publishers, developers, and hardware makers, the <a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/video-gaming-esports-etf-espo\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener\" title=\"ESPO - VanEck Video Gaming and eSports ETF - Overview\">VanEck ESPO ETF</a> provides a comprehensive view into one of the most creative, innovative, and high-growth corners of global media.
