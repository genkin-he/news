A recent change in CEO has also added to<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> uncertainty, and concerns about competition persist. Despite this, MongoDB's performance has been strong in recent quarters, including an improvement in customer acquisitions and stronger Atlas growth.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MongoDB reports its fourth quarter results on the second of March, and I expect growth to show a material improvement, although some of this is due to an easier comparable period. Strong growth and improving margins should help to address some of the concerns surrounding MongoDB's business. FY2027 guidance will likely be more important, though, and there is greater uncertainty in this regard as demand indicators for data infrastructure companies lacking direct exposure to AI spend are mixed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4823101-mongodb-reacceleration-continues-to-gather-pace\">I previously suggested</a> that the reacceleration in MongoDB's business was gathering pace. I was fairly neutral on MongoDB's near-term prospects, though, due to a combination of macro uncertainty and valuation. While the risk/reward ratio is now more favorable after the recent pullback, I am still neutral on the stock, as the AI story will take time to play out, and in the meantime, MongoDB will continue to face doubts around competition.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Market Conditions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Most signs point towards a software growth reacceleration at the moment, which is not surprising given the amount of investment that has flowed into AI in recent years. Demand remains variable across categories and solutions, though, with many companies lacking direct exposure to AI related demand continuing to struggle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cloud hyperscaler growth continues to improve, which is a positive given that AWS growth has acted as a reasonable proxy for the strength of MongoDB's cloud business in the past. There has also been a broad acceleration in the data infrastructure category (Snowflake, Databricks, Palantir) in recent quarters. MongoDB isn't benefitting from AI tailwinds as much as some of these companies, though, and Snowflake's guidance for FY2027 wasn't inspiring.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731161795685_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1221\" data-height=\"798\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731161795685_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"MongoDB Atlas and AWS Revenue Growth\" width=\"640\" height=\"418\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731161795685_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731161795685_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731161795685_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731161795685_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure 1: MongoDB Atlas and AWS Revenue Growth <span>(source: Created by author using data from company reports)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The recent downturn in job openings mentioning MongoDB in the job requirements could be considered a proxy for demand, with the recent downturn suggesting reason for caution. This is a noisy signal, though, and there appears to be some seasonality.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731157982829.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Job Openings Mentioning MongoDB in the Job Requirements\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"622\" height=\"372\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731157982829.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731157982829.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731157982829.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure 2: Job Openings Mentioning MongoDB in the Job Requirements <span>(source: <span></span></span>revealera.com<span>)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The timing and extent to which MongoDB eventually benefits from AI spending will be an important determinant of long-term returns. MongoDB's consumption-based pricing means that it is potentially well positioned for AI and agent-led transaction volume increases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI is not a material revenue driver yet, though. MongoDB has suggested that this is at least partly due to enterprises only now shifting focus from optimization to modernization. While enterprises are conducting pilots with agents, these are still small and mostly internal. MongoDB is unlikely to see a real benefit until production systems begin generating data at scale, which is still likely some way off.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Migration tailwind as organizations modernize legacy workloads should become more apparent in coming quarters, though, and MongoDB stands to benefit from the increase in applications that GenAI is enabling. MongoDB has also repeatedly highlighted the ability of AI to assist with migration efforts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">MongoDB Business Updates</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MongoDB offers a unified data platform with native capabilities in areas like search, vector search, embeddings, and stream processing. Embedding capabilities, which are an important part of RAG architectures, came through the recent acquisition of Voyage. Search and vector search capabilities were recently made available in MongoDB Community Edition and MongoDB Enterprise Server. Through these solutions, MongoDB has positioned itself to capitalize on the rise of AI and agents, and while it is beginning to see more AI related activity, this isn't meaningfully contributing to Atlas's growth yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I don't believe that AI represents a meaningful threat to MongoDB, there are competition concerns hanging over the company. These types of concerns have always surrounded the company, though, due in large part to its open-source roots. Postgres adoption is a particular threat, which MongoDB has suggested could be due to developer ignorance. MongoDB has mentioned developer mindshare a number of times in recent quarters and is investing resources to change this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is also the threat from OLAP vendors (like Databricks and Snowflake) expanding into OLTP. <a href=\"https://www.databricks.com/blog/what-is-a-lakebase\" rel=\"nofollow\">Databricks recently introduced Lakebases</a>. Lakebases separates compute and storage, and is tightly integrated with Databricks' lakehouse. Recent acquisitions by the likes of Snowflake also demonstrate that successfully building an OLTP platform internally is difficult, though. MongoDB has suggested that it has a significant lead over these companies and that these moves simply validate the importance of OLTP. Data gravity is important, though, and these are well-resourced organizations that are likely to become more competitive over time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MongoDB generated <a href=\"https://investors.mongodb.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mongodb-inc-announces-third-quarter-fiscal-2026-financial\" rel=\"nofollow\">628.3 million USD revenue</a> in the third quarter, an increase of 18.7% YoY. Atlas growth improved to 30% YoY and represented 75% of total revenue in the quarter. Current growth is still coming from core mission-critical workloads, with AI potentially providing upside at some point in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MongoDB added 2,600 customers in the quarter, continuing recent customer acquisition strength. An improvement in the company's self-service motion has been an important driver of this, with many AI native startups choosing Atlas. MongoDB's large customer count (&gt;100,000 USD ARR) also increased by roughly 16% YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MongoDB expects 665-670 million USD revenue in the fourth quarter, implying 21.7% YoY growth at the midpoint. The company has a history of giving conservative guidance, though, and revenue beats in recent quarters have been large. As a result, I expect growth to be closer to 25%, although this will be dependent on Enterprise Advanced revenue, which can be volatile. Longer term, the company has suggested that it is on a path to more than 5 billion USD revenue and profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731190767643_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1221\" data-height=\"798\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731190767643_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"MongoDB Revenue Growth\" width=\"640\" height=\"418\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731190767643_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731190767643_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731190767643_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731190767643_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure 3: MongoDB Revenue Growth <span>(source: Created by author using data from MongoDB)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MongoDB's margins are one of the more impressive aspects of the company at the moment, particularly given that growth is still strong and has been improving. A moderation in hiring along with stronger growth also suggests that MongoDB's margins will continue to improve at a fairly rapid pace going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is worth noting that Services margins are low at the moment, which often indicates a weak demand environment. This may not be the case at the moment, though, as MongoDB is trying to capitalize on the migration opportunity that GenAI has created.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731183442652_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1221\" data-height=\"798\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731183442652_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"MongoDB Margins\" width=\"640\" height=\"418\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731183442652_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731183442652_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731183442652_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731183442652_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure 4: MongoDB Margins <span>(source: Created by author using data from MongoDB)</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731162204177_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"653\" data-height=\"358\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731162204177_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MongoDB Job Openings\" width=\"640\" height=\"351\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731162204177_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731162204177_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731162204177_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731162204177_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure 5: MongoDB Job Openings <span>(source: <span></span></span>revealera.com<span>)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe MongoDB is set to report strong fourth quarter results next week, both in terms of growth and profitability. While this should be supportive of the stock, guidance for FY2027 is likely to have a larger impact. I am more cautious in this regard, as demand indicators for companies that aren't directly exposed to AI spending are mixed. While MongoDB has limited direct AI exposure, AI-driven infrastructure modernization and AI-enabled app modernization should provide growth tailwinds in coming years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The question at this point is whether MongoDB is positioned to become a core database for AI and agents or whether competition from Postgres and OLAPs limits upside. This is likely to take time to play out, but I believe MongoDB is reasonably well positioned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MongoDB's valuation could be considered attractive after the recent pullback, but this relies on an assumption of strong growth over a multi-year period and a sustainable competitive advantage long-term. I don't believe that AI presents a threat to MongoDB, but the pace at which technology is now changing makes it harder to underwrite a high revenue multiple for many software companies.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731162097416_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1078\" data-height=\"330\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731162097416_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MongoDB EV/S Ratio\" width=\"640\" height=\"196\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731162097416_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731162097416_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731162097416_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/50485001-17720731162097416_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure 6: MongoDB EV/S Ratio <span>(source: Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p>",

Since my last coverage, the fund released an updated annual report for 2025, which prompted me to revisit the fund's value proposition through 2026.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the performance over the last twelve months, we can see that BCAT's share price has slightly declined by 1.7%. It appears that the fund has essentially failed to participate in the positive market momentum over the last few quarters. When including all distributions that were paid out to shareholders, the total return jumps up to 22.5% over the same time frame. BCAT now offers investors a massive starting dividend yield of 20.8% while issuing payouts on a monthly basis. I still maintain some caution about the sustainability of payouts despite the slight dividend reduction over the last month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_594ca851cc4b40f35c71d60045ad2f09.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_594ca851cc4b40f35c71d60045ad2f09.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_594ca851cc4b40f35c71d60045ad2f09.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_594ca851cc4b40f35c71d60045ad2f09.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that the large distribution policy is an engineered approach to reduce the discount to NAV valuation. While this can benefit income investors with large income levels in the near term, this can be a detriment to the fund's long-term success. I anticipate that BCAT's share price and NAV will continue to erode over time unless the distributions are substantially reduced. So let's take an updated look at the underlying strategy that BCAT implements to generate its earnings.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund Strategy</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to the latest <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/315530/blackrock-capital-allocation-term-trust\" rel=\"nofollow\">fund overview</a>, BCAT now has total managed assets of $1.59B that are spread across a diverse portfolio of assets. The fund has a listed expense ratio of 1.47%, but this is a bit misleading since it includes operating costs and interest expenses. Closed-end funds are legally required to bulk in the expenses of their positions, but it isn't what investors actually pay. When excluding these other costs, the actual management fee sits at 1.25% of assets. BCAT is unique because it provides global exposure while also taking a blended approach between equities and fixed income securities. The fund's breakdown by asset class and region is as follows:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>North America (Equities): 40.12%</li> <li>North America (Fixed Income): 31.43%</li> <li>Europe (Equities): 9.82%</li> <li>Europe (Fixed Income): 7.88%</li> <li>Emerging Markets (Equities): 4.81%</li> <li>Commodities: 3.22%</li> <li>Emerging Market (Fixed Income): 1.89%</li> <li>Japanese (Equities): 1.03%</li> <li>Asian-Pacific (Fixed Income): 0.61%</li> <li>Japan (Fixed Income): 0.10%</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expanding on this diversity, BCAT maintains an efficient allocation across different industries. This helps reduce the fund's concentration risk to any one specific sector. As we can see below, BCAT is most heavily allocated to information technology positions at 12.83% of assets. This is followed by an allocation to financials and consumer discretionary positions, which accounts for 11.17% and 7.11% of assets, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720196609814615.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BCAT breakdown by sector\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"614\" height=\"515\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720196609814615.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720196609814615.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720196609814615.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">BlackRock</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This structure allows BCAT to provide direct equity exposure to some of the highest quality businesses in the world. For instance, the largest individual holding is currently Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) at 2.56% of assets. This is followed by an allocation to many other notable positions, including Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>), Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), and Micron Technology (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU\" title=\"Micron Technology, Inc.\">MU</a>), just to name a few. So in theory, BCAT should be a solid position for investors that want exposure to equities while also collecting a high monthly dividend income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772019630764388_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1236\" data-height=\"331\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772019630764388_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BCAT top ten holdings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"171\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772019630764388_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772019630764388_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772019630764388_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772019630764388_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">BlackRock</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The benefit of this structure is that BCAT may outperform during sideways markets. When equities are trending sideways, the income portion of the portfolio may produce cash flow that can lead to outperformance against standard index-tracking ETFs, such as Invesco QQQ Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 ETF\">QQQ</a>) or the State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>). For instance, these indices have trended sideways for the last three months, while BCAT has severely outperformed with a total return of 12.77%. However, this short-term performance does not offset the flaws of establishing long-term positioning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_d6cd95620381298f5b5f97cb2efb38bd.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_d6cd95620381298f5b5f97cb2efb38bd.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_d6cd95620381298f5b5f97cb2efb38bd.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_d6cd95620381298f5b5f97cb2efb38bd.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation &amp; Performance Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the time of my last coverage, BCAT traded at a discount to NAV of 5.36%. Despite the share price remaining flat since then, BCAT now trades at a smaller <a href=\"https://cefdata.com/funds/bcat/\" rel=\"nofollow\">discount to NAV</a> of 1.05%. For reference, BCAT has traded at an average discount to NAV of 8.65% over the last five years. Referring to the red line on the graph below, we can see how BCAT now trades at one of the lowest discounts to NAV valuations and sits at a less enticing level compared to the peer average. However, I believe this is all being engineered by the massive distributions that are being pulled directly from the NAV. As the NAV declines, the discount to NAV pricing shrinks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720194718834307_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1113\" data-height=\"647\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720194718834307_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BCAT price to NAV valuation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"372\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720194718834307_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720194718834307_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720194718834307_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720194718834307_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CEF Data</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since my last coverage, BCAT has released an <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/resources/regulatory-documents/stream-document?stream=reg&amp;product=BCAT-AGG&amp;shareClass=Class&amp;documentId=1958945%7E2021728%7E2253644%7E2201466&amp;iframeUrlOverride=%2Fus%2Findividual%2Fliterature%2Fannual-report%2Far-retail-allocation-trust.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">updated annual report</a> for 2025. This is the most up-to-date report that provides transparency into the fund's earnings. Net investment income amounted to $0.36 per share, while net realized gains landed at $1.76 per share. When looking at the prior years, we can see that the fund's net investment income has shrunk considerably from its typical range. This could be the result of higher interest rates that have caused a decline in interest income from its fixed-income securities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The report reveals that BCAT is heavily dependent on its ability to capture positive net realized gains from its positions. The only challenge is that this means the fund is reliant on positive market conditions so that its positions can rise in value. Therefore, the fund has little protection against periods of market declines, and this accelerates the rate of its NAV growth.

This flaw can be demonstrated by assessing the fund's performance since its inception. BCAT's share price has declined by 24.8% since its inception and failed to participate in the market rally over the last twelve months, even as the indices rose to new all-time highs. When including all distributions paid out to shareholders, the total return jumps up to 46.7% over the same time frame. Therefore, investors should anticipate that essentially all of their returns will come from BCAT's ability to maintain a high rate of distributions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_d1d2e6e1b24fd0e5635a79d5a16a7906.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_d1d2e6e1b24fd0e5635a79d5a16a7906.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_d1d2e6e1b24fd0e5635a79d5a16a7906.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_d1d2e6e1b24fd0e5635a79d5a16a7906.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see, BCAT's large dividend yield doesn't automatically mean that the fund will provide high returns over time. Due to the structure of the fund and its reliance on net realized gains, this flaw seems to also be true during market declines. During declines, the fund has historically maintained its high rate of distributions. The only problem is that BCAT is paying out more than it actually earns, which accelerates the decline in share price. So during market pullbacks, I anticipate BCAT to perform worse than indices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This concept was demonstrated through the market decline of 2022. For instance, SPY saw a total loss of 18.17% throughout the year. BCAT suffered from a much larger total loss of 22.64% for the same time frame, despite the large dividend yield being offered. As we experience the current selloff in the tech market, this can create another scenario where the fund suffers from a large downturn, since BCAT has direct equity exposure to many of the large-cap players in the tech space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_5f300014adffdee8fadc309a01e39de4.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_5f300014adffdee8fadc309a01e39de4.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_5f300014adffdee8fadc309a01e39de4.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_5f300014adffdee8fadc309a01e39de4.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Tradeoff</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of the latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4536686-blackrock-capital-allocation-trust-decrease-monthly-dividend-by-05-to-02607share\">declared</a> monthly distribution of $0.2607 per share, the current dividend yield sits around 20.8%. When I previously covered BCAT, I stated that I was concerned about the sustainability of payouts and believed that a significant reduction was needed. Management recently cut distributions by 0.5%, which aligns with my thesis but still makes me raise an eyebrow. This small reduction isn't really enough to drive the needle forward for structural improvement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we take this monthly distribution and multiply it by twelve months, we get an estimated annual payout of $3.1284 per share. Referring to the same annual report for 2025, we can see that the fund still continues to struggle to generate sufficient earnings to support the distributions. However, I still suspect that this is the point, and it is a strategic choice to help reduce and balance out the price-to-NAV valuation. For reference, here are the annual earnings amounts over the last few years:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>2021: $1.10 per share</li> <li>2022: ($2.81) per share</li> <li>2023: $1.92 per share</li> <li>2024: $1.83 per share</li> <li>2025: $2.12 per share</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, I anticipate that BCAT's distributions will continue to trend downward over the next twelve months. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that it's a bad income investment. We are talking about a dividend yield over 20%, which means that a massive income stream can be created with a relatively small amount of capital. I just want to emphasize that investors need to understand the tradeoffs of a dividend this large.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720192314848845_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1084\" data-height=\"405\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720192314848845_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BCAT dividend history\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"239\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720192314848845_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720192314848845_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720192314848845_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-17720192314848845_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Seeking Alpha</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the fund is paying out more than it actually earns, the underlying NAV and share price are guaranteed to decline. While this may not be as obvious if market indices continue to trend upward over the next year, it can have disastrous impacts if the technology selloff worsens. If BCAT is capable of capturing large net realized gains, the erosion in share price may happen quite slowly. However, the opposite is true if we see the tech sector continue its decline, and this will lead to BCAT's share price falling faster than standard ETFs like QQQ or SPY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, investors can get confirmation of the fund's inability to support distributions by looking at the most recent <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/literature/press-release/1-30-26-pay-date.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Section 19(a) notice</a>. The report indicates that 91% of the distribution for January was classified as return of capital. Return of capital distributions aren't coming from earnings but instead come from the underlying NAV of the fund. It's like taking money out of your left pocket and putting it into your right pocket. While not all return of capital distributions are bad, I would consider this to be one of the negative instances since it has stunted BCAT's ability to grow its NAV over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772020898576691_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1222\" data-height=\"692\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772020898576691_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"BCAT dividend breakdown\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"362\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772020898576691_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772020898576691_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772020898576691_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/31369215-1772020898576691_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">BCAT Section 19(a) Notice</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a positive note, return of capital distributions may be ideal for investors that want to limit their overall tax liability. This is because return of capital distributions aren't classified as income and, therefore, aren't taxed as such. Instead, a return of capital distribution reduces an investor's cost basis over time and allows taxes to be deferred until the time of sale.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In conclusion, I maintain a hold rating on the fund at this time. The valuation is a bit tricky here because the blended approach has resulted in outperformance against the indices over the last three months. However, the long-term performance tells another story, as the fund continues to erode its underlying NAV with the generous distributions. I suspect that management has maintained these high distributions as a way to shrink the discount to NAV, which means that there's a chance that distributions may suffer a much larger cut once management gets the share price where they want it. If the fund doesn't cut its distributions, I anticipate that the erosion in share price will continue, even if we see positive market momentum through 2026.</p>",

Currently with 131 million customers, its scalable, low-cost operations help deliver impressive profitability growth. This year could be an inflection point for NU's global expansion, recent wins of banking licenses, and local politics that could prove to be a considerable tailwind of revenue. I currently have a Buy rating on NU. Below are my key reasons.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>My Take on the Business</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Being from Brazil, I first heard of Nubank a few years ago by word of mouth, well before the bank started its massive marketing campaigns across the country. What caught my attention at first was how easy and fast it was to open an account and also how seamless the integration between checking and savings accounts looked, with a well-developed app.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Brazil is still a country with a largely unbanked population, especially lower-income individuals. Cristina Junqueira and David Vélez saw this open sea of opportunities and built something simple but powerful: a fully digital bank (checking, loans, investments, insurance, even crypto) that's super user-friendly. That yielded the bank 113 million customers in Brazil, its main market, and it became the largest private financial institution by number of clients, according to the Brazilian Central Bank. That's 62% of the total adult population (up from only 10% in 2019) while maintaining above 86% of its base as active users. Simply insane engagement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And now, with Brazil approaching saturation in the mass market, the next chapter is international. NU is already winning in Mexico and Colombia. And the U.S. is next. The model that transformed Brazilian finance has huge potential to do the same globally. As someone who's used it from the early days, I see why the momentum feels unstoppable.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>FY 2025 Numbers and Momentum</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NU just <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20414375-nu-holdings-ltd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-financial-results\">released</a> its Q4 and FY 2025 earnings, and they continue to build on an impressive series of strong growth results. For the year, revenue climbed to a record of $16.31 billion, beating estimates, up 45% on FX-neutral terms, from $11.67 billion a year prior (39% when adjusted for dollar debasement) and up almost 10-fold from 2021, with a 5-year revenue CAGR of 68%. That's mostly thanks to a CAGR of 30% in average revenue per active customer (ARPAC), reaching a record of $15 from just $5 in 2021.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59950347-17720557544975798_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2187\" data-height=\"919\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59950347-17720557544975798_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q4 Earnings Presentation charts\" width=\"640\" height=\"269\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59950347-17720557544975798_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59950347-17720557544975798_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59950347-17720557544975798_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59950347-17720557544975798_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Q4 Earnings Presentation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 shows why NU stands yet again as one of the role models of world banking efficiency. Both gross and net income continue to grow at a fast pace. A net loss of $365 million just 2 years ago in FY 2022 turned positive to an all-time high net profit of $2.9 billion in FY 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company started an impressive double-digit growth in net income in each of the last four quarters, after maintaining very thin growth in the quarters prior. This strong earnings trajectory shows me the company hit the vein in their operations and is on the right track for a sustainable level of high growth. One that is being replicated to the other markets that they are already expanding to (i.e., Mexico, Colombia).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59950347-17720597007902055_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2191\" data-height=\"1115\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59950347-17720597007902055_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Monthly Revenue and Cost Per Active User\" width=\"640\" height=\"326\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59950347-17720597007902055_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59950347-17720597007902055_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59950347-17720597007902055_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59950347-17720597007902055_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Monthly Revenue and Cost Per Active User</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its disciplined, low-cost operations and operational leverage are the heart of it all. To me, this is where the magic happens. It helped turn a 3.9% net margin from Q4 2022 to more than 18.4% in Q4 2025. This shows serious operating leverage as scale builds. Being able to grow revenue per active customer while rapidly growing their customer base and still maintaining a cost per active user below the dollar level at $0,8 is no simple task.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is highlighted by monthly ARPAC growth when analyzed long-term. It demonstrates NU's lifetime value potential and repeatability of the model. Mature cohorts, often 5-8+ years old, reach $25 to $30 monthly revenue, well above the monthly average of $15. It shows strong monetization over time as the bank earns the client's trust and more products are layered on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, NU's efficiency ratio (ER) has been consistently declining, down from 78% in Q4 2021 to 20% in Q4 2025. It's basically how much of every dollar in revenue goes to running the business. To put it in perspective, Itaú's ER was 39% in Q4 2025. Clearly, being asset-light is one of Nubank's main advantages compared to traditional legacy banks. Of course, and as management anticipates, expansion into other markets can temporarily pressure margins as they are not fully matured.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NU delivered a standout ROE of 33%, way above the industry's 11.5%, stating that the digital banking business model is here to stay. Also, return on capital is 14.3% versus peers' 3.4%. This screams efficiency.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Growth Drivers and Expansion Plans</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, NU's 2026 outlook is bolstered by several catalysts, both globally and locally in Brazil. The first is its ongoing international expansion to Mexico and Colombia, along with its foundational steps toward a full-scale U.S. launch.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bank is building the foundation to scale their model globally, while Latin America has the potential to repeat history in two new high-growth markets with consumer behaviors quite similar to Brazil. The core model remains about low customer acquisition costs, followed by cross-selling to build on lifetime value. The blueprint is there to follow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Mexico, NU plans a $4.2 billion investment to fuel expansion, where it already has 13 million customers. The unit achieved a banking charter upgrade in 2025, enabling broader services. Mexico's operations are exactly where Brazil's were at NU's beginning, yet more profitable and with a lot more share to gain (now only 14% of the population, compared to 61% in Brazil).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its S-curve is steeper, while Brazil's seems to be reaching a flatter growth. Colombia, though smaller (4 million customers), shows similar promise to Mexico, with rapid customer adds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/59950347-1771087134970504_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1194\" data-height=\"541\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/59950347-1771087134970504_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nu's Brazil vs Mexico S-Curve chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"290\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/59950347-1771087134970504_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/59950347-1771087134970504_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/59950347-1771087134970504_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/59950347-1771087134970504_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Nu's Brazil vs Mexico S-Curve (Q3 Earnings Presentation)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Brazil's new income tax exemption</em> could be one of the biggest tailwinds to Nubank in 2026. Last year, the <a href=\"https://www.internationaltaxreview.com/article/2fp4qg1922wi7yb6u8kjk/sponsored/brazil-approves-dividend-taxation-and-expands-income-tax-exemptions#:~:text=The%20income%20tax%20exemption,from%20the%20individual%20income%20tax.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Brazilian Government announced</a> a raise of the minimum threshold in the income tax bracket for tax exemption and also discounts for mid-bracket individuals, both beginning this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is estimated to leave, on average, R$3,000 more each year not paid in tax, to around 20-25 million customers that can now spend even more. That is also expected to inject R$28 billion (~US$5.4 billion) into the economy via consumer spending. This is one of many demagogic measures the government took to begin an electoral year, seeking reelection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/59950347-17712684853256538_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1407\" data-height=\"425\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/59950347-17712684853256538_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Average Revenue Per Active User chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"193\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/59950347-17712684853256538_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/59950347-17712684853256538_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/59950347-17712684853256538_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/16/59950347-17712684853256538_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Average Revenue Per Active User (Q3 Earnings Presentation)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now let's do some quick and conservative math: 25 million people impacted by the exemption times R$3,000 a year, that's R$75 billion of net new money per year on the table. Obviously, not all of it will go to Nubank. But it's quite fair to say that most of them are clients of NU.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, not many analysts (if any!) are considering how this could impact NU's operations, given they mostly target lower-income individuals. By the government's expectations, around 41% of this total will be spent immediately, but I believe it will be much more, closer to 70%!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are two channels where Nubank can profit from this opportunity. The first one is consumer saving. More funding through the NuConta savings account, yielding CDI (14.90% a year), while, conservatively, the bank earns a spread of 1% to 2%. Let's say only 20% of NU's active clients in Brazil are directly benefited, so around 22.6 million clients. If only 30% of the extra money stays at NuConta, at a 2% spread, that's roughly R$406 million ($79 million) a year of extra revenue for the bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second channel is, well, spending. Brazilians spend almost all of their salary monthly (be it discretionary or not), especially among low-income groups. So, more money means more spending using Nubank's credit card. More credit card spending means more interchange fees (around 1%-2% per transaction). If 70% of the extra money is spent and only 40% of what is spent is done so with the credit card, this could add up to R$379 million (US$74 million) of revenue a year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, the more a customer earns, the higher the credit limit tends to be - and the more credit the bank can originate. This could also boost credit volume while also reducing provisions, increasing revenue by another R$500M to R$1B a year. All added up, this could mean a total of R$1 to R$1.7 billion (up to $331 million) in extra annual revenue not priced in. I'll be closely looking for company guidance on this subject after its Q1 2026 earnings release.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another powerful new chapter to NU's operations is its <em>U.S. Market Entry:</em> On January 29, 2026, NU received conditional OCC <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4544433-nubank-gets-occ-approval-for-us-bank-charter\">approval for a U.S. national bank charter</a>, targeting underserved populations across all 50 states. Launch is planned for 2027, but preparations-including appointing former Brazil Central Bank President Roberto Campos Neto as chairman- are already taking place and signal serious intent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This move tests NU's ability to replicate its LatAm success in a mature market, potentially unlocking new revenue streams, in order to evolve into a global digital banking platform.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NU also intends to secure a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4528103-nu-unit-intends-to-obtain-banking-license-in-brazil-in-2026\">full banking license in Brazil in 2026</a>, enhancing its offerings while retaining the Nubank brand. This could improve funding costs and product diversity in its core market, where it serves over half of Brazil's adult population.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a lesser note, <em>Partnerships and Branding</em> with big players like Amazon, Uber, Burger King, iFood, and Shopee could also bolster NU's expansion to new customers in new locations. A recently closed <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4540942-nu-becomes-official-team-partner-of-mercedes-amg-petronas-f1-in-multi-year-deal\">multi-year deal</a> with Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team, starting in 2026, surely boosts global visibility and has the possibility to bring higher-net-worth customers. Good timing for marketing, considering Nubank's entrance into the U.S. market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>AI and efficiency</em> is another hot topic. It is being adopted by the bank as a structural tool to drive better decisions, personalized experiences for clients, and stronger economics. From CEO David Velez's comments in their Q3 conference call:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Our vision is to become AI-First, which means integrating foundation models deeply into our operations to drive an AI-native interface to banking, while creating meaningful benefits for both our customers and our business.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NU's pivot to an \"AI-first\" bank enhances personalization, cost controls and supports profitable scaling. AI helps with credit decisions (through nuFormer credit underwriting in Brazil) to prevent fraud and minimize provisions, keeping delinquencies low, and also helps to identify product cross-sell opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/59950347-17710915494496856_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1126\" data-height=\"617\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/59950347-17710915494496856_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nu's AI-First opps image\" width=\"640\" height=\"351\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/59950347-17710915494496856_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/59950347-17710915494496856_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/59950347-17710915494496856_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/14/59950347-17710915494496856_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Nu's AI-<span></span>First Opps (Earnings Presentation)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Valuation</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of February 25, Nu Holdings closed at $16.67 per share, reflecting a market capitalization of approximately $80.68 billion. This positions the stock with a trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.04, based on trailing twelve-month earnings per share (EPS) of $0.59. On a 1Y forward basis, the P/E drops to 19.61, incorporating analyst expectations for continued earnings growth. These multiples suggest a premium valuation relative to traditional banks (industry average trailing P/E around 12.99x), but they appear more reasonable when viewed through the lens of Nu's high-growth fintech profile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_71e60a0aadbfb3a09b5386fe40d7734c.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_71e60a0aadbfb3a09b5386fe40d7734c.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_71e60a0aadbfb3a09b5386fe40d7734c.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_71e60a0aadbfb3a09b5386fe40d7734c.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Applying a conservative 25x multiple to 2026 EPS of $0.85 yields a target price of $21.25, implying ~26% upside from current levels. More aggressive scenarios (e.g., 30x, aligning with high-growth fintechs) could push it to $25.50.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Against Latin American peers (e.g., Itaú Unibanco or Banco Bradesco), Nu's P/E is a premium due to its digital-first model and 131 million customers (with 86% monthly engagement). Versus global fintechs like SoFi or Revolut (private), Nu's valuation is competitive, especially with net margins expanding to 18.4% in Q4 2025 from near-zero in 2022. In a neobank comparison (e.g., vs. Inter &amp; Co.), Nu stands out for its 2026 potential due to its scale and AI pivot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the broader industry, U.S. banks trade at around 12x P/E, but high-growth disruptors often command 20-30x. Nu's 19.61x forward aligns it closer to the latter, yet shows me the market does not price in all of NU's potential. There's room for a strong rerating if U.S. entry (via recent OCC approval) succeeds.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks to Consider</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Being a Brazilian myself, I'm not blind to the downsides. Brazil's economy can be volatile-elections, inflation, constant legal uncertainty -though Nu's credit quality has held up well so far. Competition is fierce from traditional local banks like Itaú, neobanks like Inter &amp; Co., and in the U.S., it'll be JPMorgan, Chime, etc. Valuation-wise, trailing P/E is around 32x, forward around 20x premium to traditional banks, but justified by the growth. Volatility from macro or regulatory delays is always possible. Also, getting full U.S. compliance and Brazilian license approval isn't guaranteed. In my view, though, the risk of a right-wing candidate winning the election this year and changing tax brackets to what they once were seems remote.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nu Holdings remains a compelling growth story. To me, NU's competing with MercadoLibre (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MELI\" title=\"MercadoLibre, Inc.\">MELI</a>) to become Latin America's most valuable company in a few years. The valuation now, while not \"cheap\" in absolute terms, is undemanding relative to 30%+ growth and improving profitability. The data supports upside of 25-31%, making it attractive despite recent surges, provided execution on global expansion continues and the firm can capitalize on political, fiscal/economic tailwinds. In summary, I rate NU as a buy for long-term investors, with a fair value range of $18-22.</p>",

This should help the company navigate the pressures from Mainland China, where sales of illegal products<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> are affecting the volume of compliant products. Additionally, the margins are expected to improve, supported by benefits from a favourable revenue mix and operating leverage. The company is trading at a discount of ~43% to its long-term average. Given the strategic initiatives and this discount, I believe it is an attractive investment opportunity.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is engaged in the business of Development and Sale of closed-system vaping products under the RELX brand. The company’s main source of Revenue is from the sale of Devices and pods, mainly in the regions of Mainland China and an increasing presence in European and Asian Markets in lieu of growing demand. They are operating in a highly regulated industry, with Geographic diversification and compliance with the regulations forming a key part of their strategy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue Analysis &amp; Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the third quarter of FY2025, the company reported net sales of RMB 1,129 million in Q3 FY2025, an increase of 49% year-over-year and 28% from the previous quarter. This was driven by increased international exposure, especially strong growth in the East Asian market. Additionally, Europe contributed through the inclusion of the net sales result of the invested e-vapor business. However, the sales from Mainland China remain sluggish due to the sales of illegal substitutes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead in FY2026, the company should drive revenue growth from the international markets. The strategic investment in Europe and the retail franchise model in East Asia should be a tailwind in the coming quarters. However, China should remain subdued but improve in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">RLX Technology entered into a strategic investment agreement with a European-based e-vapor company in March 2025. This partnership aims to increase the international exposure of the company, especially related to European regulatory-compliant business. Moreover, this initiative should enable the company to tap direct access to the market by becoming a local operator rather than a remote supplier. The third quarter of FY2025 was the first quarter that the company included consolidated net sales from this strategic investment. This implies that the net sales from the partnership should help support robust growth on a year-over-year comparison through the first half of FY2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In East Asia, the vape market is fragmented, due to which independent vape stores dominate the category sales and impact customer purchase patterns. This market fragmentation has negatively impacted the company and increased competition from noncompliant products. With a franchise model, the company aims to provide renovation subsidies for enhancing the retail stores' experience. This initiative involves <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4843815-rlx-technology-inc-rlx-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">450 partners</a>, which should drive revenue growth in the coming quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the regulatory tailwind should support the net sales from China, the challenges in the market should continue to persist in the near term. Mainland China is actively working on strengthening the regulatory enforcement around e-vapor, which should change the market dynamics. The increased customer inspections have limited the illegal re-entry of exported products, which should make the customers switch back to regulatory-compliant products. However, the unregulated e-vapor market still poses a headwind due to online sales of these illegal products. The third quarter’s net sales from Mainland China represent <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4843815-rlx-technology-inc-rlx-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">~13%</a> of Q2 FY2021 levels, indicating the persistent challenges in the market. Therefore, I believe in continued reduced net sales from the China region. With a potential recovery if there are continued enforcement actions against illegal online sales of e-vapor products.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margin Analysis &amp; Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>The non-GAAP operating margin stood at 16.7%, an improvement of 400 basis points and 370 basis points quarter on quarter. The improvements were driven by a favorable geographic revenue mix from East Asia &amp; Europe, consolidation of higher-margin European business, and volume leverage.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, I believe the margins should expand on a year-over-year comparison, driven by a favourable geographic revenue mix, particularly from the equity investment in the European business. Although regulatory enhancements in China are dynamic, I believe the increased international exposure should provide support to gross margins. Moreover, the volume leverage from revenue growth should provide support to the non-GAAP operating margin, but overall expansion depends on market stability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In FY2026, the margins of the company should continue to benefit from the inclusion of higher-margin European business, which should lead to a favourable geographic mix. Given increasing international revenue as a % of total net sales, the overall gross margins should improve in the coming quarters. Moreover, with revenue growth, the company should benefit from the volume leverage if the fixed cost absorption is spread over a broader base, supporting the operating profit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the contrary, the company should continue to face challenges from the regulatory uncertainties and competitive landscape in Mainland China. The continued illegal market activity, especially online illegal product sales, should limit volume growth and pricing power. Given these conditions, I believe the performance from China should weigh on overall margin expansion in the coming quarters.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 Earnings Preview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The revenue growth in the fourth quarter of FY2025 should be supported by the contribution from the strategic investment in the European e-vapor business. Given the growth in this business, the year-over-year comparison of net sales should remain favourable in the coming quarter. However, the performance in Mainland China should remain subdued due to regulatory dynamics and continued sales of illegal products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the margin front, the gross margin should be supported by the higher-margin European business in the fourth quarter. However, the sustainability of the margin expansion depends on competitive pressures in China, which may offset the benefits of a favourable mix on the margins.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">RLX Technology is currently trading at a P/E Non-GAAP (FWD) ratio of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RLX/earnings/estimates\">17.57x</a> with an FY2026 consensus EPS estimate of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RLX/earnings/estimates\">$0.14</a>. With a growing international exposure, particularly in the European market, the growth in revenue should remain supported. Additionally, adoption of the franchise model in East Asia should also act as a tailwind for the company's revenue growth in the coming quarters. However, the market challenges in Mainland China should continue to weigh on the net sales. The company should drive margin expansion supported by a favourable geographic revenue mix and operating leverage. Given these factors, I believe the company should meet the current consensus estimate with potential upside if there is stronger regulatory enforcement on the illegal products in China.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My investment thesis is premised on the growth from the strategic investment that the company made in Europe, along with traction from its franchise model. However, if regulatory compliance requirements change or operations from international exposure do not meet expectations, it may negatively impact the company's earnings. Moreover, if regulatory enforcement fails to control the illegal products in China, it may further deteriorate the performance of the company.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a P/E ratio of 17.57 and a 5-year average of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RLX/valuation/metrics\">25.14x</a>, the company is trading at a ~43% discount. While it is true that the outlook for Mainland China is likely to remain sluggish, the company is progressing toward increasing its international exposure through strategic investments in Europe. Additionally, improved brand positioning in East Asia should support earnings growth. Considering the growth drivers along with the discount based on long-term averages, I recommend a Buy rating on the stock.</p>",

For one thing, there is an aging population. Last October, the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ageing-and-health\" target=\"_blank\">World Health Organization wrote</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>By 2030, 1 in 6 people in the world will be aged 60 years or over. At this time the share of the population aged 60 years and over will increase from 1 billion in 2020 to 1.4 billion.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The pressure this puts on the senior care niche was echoed in a <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/senior-caregiving-labor.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/senior-caregiving-labor.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC article</a> this winter, which said:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The senior population is skyrocketing as baby boomers peak and nursing homes start to see more residents.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, as in my prior articles on this stock, I believe there is a natural demand driver for these types of facilities, and although CTRE is the landlord and does not directly deal with patients, it partners with healthcare operators who do that part. For instance, <a href=\"https://investor.caretrustreit.com/files/doc_earnings/2025/q4/presentation/Exhibit-99-2-CTRE-Q4-2025-Financial-Supplement.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investor.caretrustreit.com/files/doc_earnings/2025/q4/presentation/Exhibit-99-2-CTRE-Q4-2025-Financial-Supplement.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Q4 results</a> show that <a href=\"https://ensigngroup.net/about/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ensigngroup.net/about/\" target=\"_blank\">The Ensign Group</a> is a major operator they work with.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, though, the demand for services in this sector has put a strain on the ability to find a qualified workforce, with even back in 2022 an article in the Natl. Library of Medicine pointing out that:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>...87% of nursing homes have moderate to high levels of staffing shortages, and hiring new staff has been challenging for 98% of nursing homes.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that further supports the argument that demand could continue being a tailwind for this niche, and so I am highly bullish in this section.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Competitive Positioning</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to competitive positioning, CTRE does not directly manage the patients, but it can compete for investors with similar REITs, so here are some metrics to consider.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First off, I picked three publicly traded <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/comparison/new/MCUyQ2N0cmUlMkNsdGMlMkNvaGklMkN3ZWxs\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/comparison/new/MCUyQ2N0cmUlMkNsdGMlMkNvaGklMkN3ZWxs\" target=\"_blank\">REIT comparables</a> in the senior care/skilled nursing niche: LTC Properties (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LTC\" title=\"LTC Properties, Inc.\">LTC</a>), Omega Healthcare Investors (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OHI\" title=\"Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc.\">OHI</a>), and Welltower (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WELL\" title=\"Welltower Inc.\">WELL</a>). In terms of market cap, CTRE is somewhere in the middle, with Welltower being clearly the largest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Though not the biggest, CTRE led in top-line growth with a five-year revenue CAGR of nearly +22%, based on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/comparison/new/MCUyQ2N0cmUlMkNsdGMlMkNvaGklMkN3ZWxs\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/comparison/new/MCUyQ2N0cmUlMkNsdGMlMkNvaGklMkN3ZWxs\" target=\"_blank\">peer data</a>, and it was 2nd in return on equity with an ROE of +9.1%, also impressive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another competitive edge could be its UK expansion. In fact, CareTrust's CEO, Dave Sedgwick, said in an <a href=\"https://www.reit.com/news/video/caretrust-reit-ceo-says-expansion-uk-market-transformative-reit\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.reit.com/news/video/caretrust-reit-ceo-says-expansion-uk-market-transformative-reit\" target=\"_blank\">interview for NAREIT</a> last year that acquiring Care REIT plc was a:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>...transformative deal, marking its first international expansion, as well as adding 135 properties and diversifying its geographic footprint and portfolio mix.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further, we cannot ignore the fact that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTRE/momentum/performance\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTRE/momentum/performance\" target=\"_blank\">momentum data</a> shows CTRE with a 10-year price return of +246%, not only beating the peer group but also edging above a major benchmark like the S&amp;P 500, something I have not seen many REITs I've covered being able to do yet:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/58572054-17720022161849248_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"776\" data-height=\"423\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/58572054-17720022161849248_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"CTRE -

On an annualized basis, the payout ratio was approximately 71% based on fourth quarter 2025 Normalized FFO.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At below 75%, I believe the payout ratio is still reasonable and not getting into dangerous territory, so it would appear they can cover the dividend adequately, and the FFO growth projections and strong margins should continue to support the case for dividend safety going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, think about the fact that this type of REIT is not subject to the same cyclical swings that a hotel REIT or retail REIT could be, which are exposed to consumer spending confidence, seasonal travel and shopping trends, and recessionary factors. It doesn't make those REIT sectors bad, since I invest in them actually, but it just presents a very different risk profile to consider.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, I am bullish on CTRE's dividend story and am including it in my dividend ideas for February.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Metrics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To change things up, here I'll present my valuation and price target worksheet, which I did not include in my initial rating of this stock, yet I think could add some more color to the thesis.

Wall St. target</a> of +7.2% upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, I've already shown that CTRE has strong and improving margins, a positive earnings guidance for the near term, and beats several peers on ROE, so I would call this an undervaluation opportunity with upside potential, and hence a <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"68330436\">buy</em>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Technical Charting</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another new feature since my initial rating on this stock, to add an additional angle this time, is to consider technical chart patterns, with the goal of pattern recognition in price movements.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_d72fa33ec2e4300ed3882955adf10c67.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_d72fa33ec2e4300ed3882955adf10c67.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_d72fa33ec2e4300ed3882955adf10c67.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_d72fa33ec2e4300ed3882955adf10c67.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The patterns that immediately stick out are the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"68330436\">buy</em> signal (golden cross pattern) that formed this summer, after which both moving averages, the 50-day and 200-day SMA, have been parallel and trending upward. In addition, the share price has mostly remained above the 50-day, which is acting as a strong support so far. In fact, that support was tested, it seems, a few times, and the price just came back up again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am inclined to say <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"68330436\">buy</em> based on this pattern since it seems like continuing bullish momentum rather than trend consolidation, and certainly no bearish signals are in sight.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interestingly, this technical pattern actually supports and bolsters the rest of my article, which is based on fundamentals rather than technicals, and strengthens the overall bullish thesis even more.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks and Challenges to Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One factor that could challenge my strong <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"68330436\">buy</em> rating that has not been otherwise covered in this article is payor risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although this applies more to this REIT's tenant operators since they are the ones getting reimbursed, it certainly can impact the REIT if its major tenants are under pressure to accept lower rates from insurers and Medicare/Medicaid, thereby impacting their own cash flow. Experienced investors and analysts in this niche, I think, are equally paying attention to this REIT's tenants, like Ensign and others, as they are to the REIT, so payor reimbursement trends come into play, and when it comes to Medicare/Medicaid, those are also subject to political decisions at the state and federal level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is more of a sector risk than one limited to this REIT, since all of its peers could be in the same boat, so it is important for sector investors to bake that into their risk management strategy. There is also not much of a mitigating factor here since this niche is literally fully exposed to tenants with such payor risk, unlike REITs that have stores, apartments, or data centers, for instance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To wrap things up, in my follow-up on CTRE this time, I am actually upgrading it from my last few articles after considering new data and additional angles, and this time I'm agreeing with <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTRE/ratings/sell-side-ratings\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CTRE/ratings/sell-side-ratings\" target=\"_blank\">Wall St.'s strong <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"68330436\">buy</em> consensus</a> (as of Wednesday).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To summarize, CTRE is a compelling dividend idea that is also convincing as a growth story and offers the opportunity for portfolio exposure to the niche of healthcare REITs focused on a high-demand segment: skilled nursing and senior care, which shows plenty of reason for further upside potential.</p>",

We believe our broad appeal comes from our large selection of licenses and properties that we apply across a variety of product categories and brands. We do not limit ourselves by targeting discrete demographics such as only collectors or children seeking the latest (and often short-lived) toy craze. We strive to have something for everyone by offering figures and other product categories including bags, wallets, apparel, plush, accessories, homewares and more. We expect to continue to look for ways to diversify our product offerings to reach an even broader group of consumers.</p> <p>In addition to offering multiple properties and product categories, we create and sell a variety of unique brands that have their own look and feel. Our brand portfolio includes Core Collectible (which include Pop! Vinyl, as well as other branded lines such as Soda, Bitty Pop!, and Pop! Yourself), Loungefly (softlines including bags, wallets, backpacks and apparel)</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main products are the Funko Pop plastic toys that are in the collectible toy category, along with things like Star Wars figures, Pokémon, and Pop Mart toys. They also have a wide array of Loungefly higher-end backpacks and apparel. The IP leasing catalog is vast. If the rights to use those alone could be carried over to a buyer, that could be valuable in and of itself. The market reaction to the news of an activist stepping in was a big pop and then a subsiding.

The Popmart stores and brands are headquartered in Beijing, China, and the company is listed in Hong Kong. Many of the artists and creators of the themes are from China.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Popmart stores are now all over the US and the world.</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Popmarts are now \"popping up\" all over the world, and the world has a wide reach.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why all the fuss about Popmart</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is because I believe the size and type of vinyl that Funko Pops use is pretty similar to what you'll find on Popmart blind box toys, minus the fur. This could be a capacity sale combined with a licensing agreement acquisition story.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although Funko designs the toys in the US, they are manufactured in China, Vietnam, and Mexico, so we can assume that China-based Popmart would be familiar with the company's manufacturing and logistics operations already.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another competitor that may want the capacity could also be <strong>Miniso</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MNSO\" title=\"MINISO Group Holding Limited\">MNSO</a>). This Guangzhou, China based company is listed in the US and has a replica business model to Popmart. Toy stores all over the US and abroad are stocked with Asian-themed blind box toys and accessories.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An activist investor buying a stake and publicly promoting a sale exploration tells me they could see the assets, licensing, and logistics as key marketing components. The existing pop toys and backpacks are not gaining any further market share and falling out of style, it appears. My analysis is that the manufacturing assets are the key value proposition for more popular toy brands to acquire.</p>",

This compares to its historical averages in the mid-20x range. I believe the premium is justified, especially given TJX’s ongoing appeal in the current high-priced consumer environment, as well as its strong operating results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the SA community is broadly neutral on TJX, analysts on Wall Street are seeing additional upside remaining. Granted, the potential is less than 10% from current trading levels based on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TJX/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">current price target</a>. I believe that TJX can certainly reach this target, but it’s not exactly an impressive rate of return, in my view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49921492-17720702371325748_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"873\" data-height=\"294\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49921492-17720702371325748_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha - Average Price Target Of TJX Stock\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"216\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49921492-17720702371325748_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49921492-17720702371325748_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49921492-17720702371325748_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49921492-17720702371325748_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha - Average Price Target Of TJX Stock</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TJX Q4 Results Recap</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TJX closed out the year exactly the way investors have come to expect, and that is by outperforming.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20412856-the-tjx-companies-inc-reports-q4-and-full-year-fy26-results-q4-comp-sales-growth-pretax#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">Q4 topline</a> rose 9%, while consolidated comp sales increased a very strong 5%, ahead of plan and on top of a 5% increase last year. That’s a tough comparison made to look easy, in my view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Importantly, the comp was driven by both higher average ticket and increased transactions, a clear sign that traffic remains healthy and consumers are responding to the value proposition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability was just as impressive, in my view. Adjusted gross margin expanded 60 basis points to 31.1%, helped by stronger merchandise margins and expense leverage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pretax margin improved to 12.2%, also up 60 basis points, and adjusted EPS came in at $1.43, up 16% YOY and $0.05/share <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556613-tjx-non-gaap-eps-of-1_43-beats-by-0_05-revenue-of-17_74b-beats-by-360m\">ahead of expectations</a>. Shrink improvement was another highlight, with management noting levels are now essentially back to pre-COVID norms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Full-year results justify TJX’s current stock outperformance, in my view. Total sales, for example, surpassed the +$60B mark and EPS climbed 11% YOY. In addition, every division posted comp growth of 4% or better.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Is The Outlook For TJX Stock?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874698-the-tjx-companies-inc-tjx-q4-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">Looking ahead</a>, the guidance remains positive with a hint of a ‘back to earth’ vibe as it relates to the growth trajectory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Drilling down into it, for FY27, TJX is calling for comp sales growth of 2% to 3%, a step down from the 5% pace delivered this year. In addition, total sales are expected to rise 4% to 5%, with EPS projected between $4.93 and $5.02, representing growth of 4% to 6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margins are also expected to remain healthy. Gross margin is guided to improve modestly to 31.1%–31.2%, driven by higher merchandise margins, while pretax margin is expected to be flat to up slightly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What’s important for TJX is that they continue to invest in growth, and it appears they will be meeting that expectation in the new fiscal year. The company plans to open 146 net new stores, complete more than 500 remodels, and spend over +$2B in CAPEX to support long-term expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, shareholders will continue to benefit from meaningful capital returns, including a planned 13% dividend increase and up to +$2.8B in buybacks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Is TJX Stock A Buy, Sell, Or Hold?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There’s no question in my mind that TJX remains one of the best bets in retail. I actually had titled one of my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4580190-the-tjx-companies-off-price-remains-the-best-bet-in-retail\">past articles</a> this tag in early 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Backing up this statement today is that traffic trends remain healthy, margins are expanding, and management is confidently investing in long-term growth. This is exactly what you want to see from a best-in-class off-price retailer, in my view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, shares have run up in a significant way since my early calls on the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With shares trading at over 30x forward earnings and sitting near the top end of the 52-week range, I believe much of the operational strength is already reflected in the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The guidance for FY27 calls for solid, but more normalized, mid-single-digit earnings growth. That type of growth profile simply does not leave a wide margin of safety at current valuation levels, in my view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Could shares grind higher? Absolutely. The management team has earned the benefit of the doubt from me on that. But with consensus price targets implying less than 10% upside and the multiple well above historical norms, I don’t see a compelling risk-reward setup here.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For long-term holders who are likely sitting on hefty gains, I believe TJX remains a core, high-quality name worth owning. For new investment, however, patience may be rewarded. At current levels, I view TJX as a ‘hold’, waiting for a more attractive entry point.</p>",

Surprisingly, revenue and adjusted earnings per<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> share both came in above what analysts anticipated. What's more, management is forecasting further growth in 2026 to take financial performance higher than what the business has seen over the last couple of years now.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conceptually, this is great. And what's even better is that, on both an absolute basis and relative to other similar firms, the stock is priced at levels that look cheap. Naturally, this would draw my attention. In the past, however, the market has not really agreed with me all that much. In fact, back in May of 2025, I ended up <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4781487-bjs-restaurants-investors-should-be-optimistic\">upgrading the stock</a> from a ‘hold’ to a ‘buy’. Since then, however, the stock has risen only 9.1%, falling woefully short of the 22.8% increase that the S&amp;P 500 has achieved. But honestly, considering how cheap the stock is and factoring in its continued growth, I firmly stand by my previous assessment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A great way to end 2025</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The final quarter of the 2025 fiscal year was, in many respects, a positive time for shareholders of BJ's Restaurants. Management reported revenue for the quarter of $355.4 million. That happened to be an increase of 3.2% over the $344.3 million the company reported a year earlier, and it exceeded analysts' <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BJRI/earnings\">estimates</a> by $1.6 million. Some of this rise was driven by an increase in the number of locations in operation from 218 to 219. But that's not the only thing that added to the top line growth. The company also reported comparable restaurant sales growth of 2.6%, pushing overall comparable sales up to 2% for 2025 in its entirety compared to the 1.2% achieved from 2024 to 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887058842947_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1974\" data-height=\"856\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887058842947_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"278\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"278\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887058842947_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887058842947_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887058842947_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887058842947_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Compilation - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to management, traffic growth was particularly robust, jumping 4.5% year over year. This was fueled by continued innovation when it comes to the company's menu. For instance, during the quarter, it built on its seasonal Pizookie momentum, specifically through the return of its Monkey Bread Pizookie and the introduction of its Dubai Chocolate Pizookie. The latter of these also entitled patrons to an accompanying martini. The firm also launched its renovated pizza platform that management said is currently resonating well with guests and achieving consistent performance. This does not mean that management is focused only on expanding its menu. In fact, the company ended 2025 with a net reduction of six menu items and four ingredient SKUs. Plus, it is investing more into not only its social media presence, specifically through relevant product news, but also it is relying on word of mouth. The fact that the company completed 19 remodels throughout 2025, bringing the total number of remodels systemwide to just shy of 50%, means that customers are having a new experience that is certainly bringing them back time and time again. These changes have included certain technological improvements as well, such as tagging and tracking its equipment. The goal here is to remain more operationally efficient, and as you will see shortly, that is certainly having a positive impact on the bottom line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887178985512_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1704\" data-height=\"894\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887178985512_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"336\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"336\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887178985512_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887178985512_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887178985512_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720887178985512_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>&gt;Author's Compilation - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of profits, earnings per share for the quarter came in at $0.58. While that represented a meaningful improvement over the $0.23 in losses that the company incurred the previous year, it did, unfortunately, fall short of expectations that analysts had set to the tune of $0.03. But still, the fact that the company went from a net loss of $5.3 million to a net profit of $12.6 million is most certainly something to write home about. Adjusted earnings per share did considerably better, rising from $0.47 to $0.66. In addition to exceeding analysts’ estimates by $0.04, the improvement meant a rise in adjusted net income from $11.1 million to $14.3 million. I wish I could say that we had data regarding operating cash flow. But at this time, we don't. We do know, however, that on a year-over-year basis, EBITDA for the company expanded from $33.1 million to $35.6 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886741767344_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1980\" data-height=\"840\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886741767344_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"272\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"272\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886741767344_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886741767344_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886741767344_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886741767344_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>&gt;Author's Compilation - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the chart above, you can see financial results for 2025 in their entirety compared to 2024. Revenue, earnings, and adjusted earnings all increased nicely. Also on the rise ended up being EBITDA. What's really awesome is that management expects continued momentum into 2026. Management continues to focus on building engagement with its seasonal Pizookies. Plus, it is likely to continue rolling out innovative products. That's not just speculation. In fact, management specified in their <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-bjs-restaurants-q4-2025-sees-eps-beat-stock-steady-93CH-4526167\" rel=\"nofollow\">latest earnings call</a> that they are in the early stages of testing refreshes to their burger category and chicken sandwiches. The goal of all of this is to build on the foundations of the company laid in 2025. And if that goes according to plan, overall comparable sales for 2026 should rise by another 1% to 3%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From that, we should expect EBITDA of somewhere between $140 million and $150 million for the year. That compares nicely to the $134.1 million the company reported for 2025. In all likelihood, this would mean a rise in adjusted net profits from $51.1 million to $55.3 million. And it should mean growth in adjusted operating cash flow to around $179.3 million. As I mentioned earlier in this article, management has not provided comprehensive cash flow data yet. But this growth was based on projecting out results for the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same time in 2024. That would have meant a rise in adjusted operating cash flow from $141.9 million in 2024 to $165.8 million last year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886907896712_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2050\" data-height=\"900\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886907896712_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trading Multiples\" width=\"640\" height=\"281\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"281\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886907896712_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886907896712_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886907896712_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/9866571-17720886907896712_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>&gt;Author's Compilation - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using these estimates, we can see in the chart above how shares of the company are priced at the moment. Honestly, these are very low multiples. This is especially true when it comes to the cash flow figures. Relative to other similar restaurant companies, the stock is certainly trading on the cheaper end of the spectrum as well. In that same chart, you can see how it compares to five other similar terms. On a price-to-earnings basis, only two of the five companies are cheaper than it is. One of them is cheaper on a price to operating cash flow basis. Meanwhile, when it came to the EV to EBITDA approach, BJ's Restaurants ended up being cheaper than any of these companies.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on all the data provided right now, I must say that I am feeling very optimistic about BJ's Restaurants. Management has done an exceptional job as of late. For some reason, the market is still resistant to this candidate. The firm has increased since I last wrote about it. But it has not increased anywhere near enough to justify anything other than a bullish outlook. Given this, I believe that maintaining BJ's Restaurants as a very solid ‘buy’ candidate is the right move.</p>",

The S&amp;P 500 Index increased 2.7% during the quarter, bringing full-year returns to 17.9%. Performance was shaped by the evolving monetary policy backdrop following the Federal Reserve's (\"Fed\") initial rate cut in September, with additional cuts in October and December, as investors balanced expectations for a gradual easing cycle against evidence of slowing, but still resilient economic fundamentals. The Fed maintained its data-dependent messaging throughout the quarter, signaling willingness to ease further as inflation continued moderating toward its target while labor market conditions softened at the margin. This approach helped contain interest rate volatility and provided support for equity valuations.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Corporate earnings remained broadly positive despite moderating growth rates. Forward guidance pointed to continued, albeit more measured, profit expansion into 2026. AI and technology-related sectors continued to drive earnings leadership, though contributions broadened to include Health Care, Industrials, and Consumer Discretionary stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mid-cap stocks lagged both large- and small-cap stocks. The Russell 1000® Index was up 2.4%, and the Russell 2000® returned 2.2%, while the Russell Midcap® Index was up just 0.2%. Value stocks – as measured by the Russell Indexes – outperformed growth stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nine of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors posted positive returns in the fourth quarter. Sector leadership was concentrated in the Health Care and Communication Services sectors, while Real Estate and Utilities lagged.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the fourth quarter, the Harbor Mid Cap Value Fund (Institutional Class, \"Fund\") returned 4.07%, outperforming its benchmark, the Russell Midcap® Value Index, which returned 1.42%. Among mid-caps, value stocks outperformed growth stocks, as the Russell Midcap® Growth Index returned -3.7%. The outperformance of value stocks had a positive impact on relative results given our value discipline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We take limited sector and industry bets and look to add value primarily from bottom-up stock selection. During the fourth quarter, stock selection accounted for most of the value added, however, sector selection was also positive. From a sector perspective, the Fund's underweight to Utilities and Real Estate added value. Stock selection added value in several sectors, particularly Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, and Financials.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Contributors &amp; Detractors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following strong performance in the third quarter, Information Technology holding Sandisk (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SNDK\" title=\"Sandisk Corporation\">SNDK</a>) significantly outperformed again in the fourth quarter. AI-driven demand for storage led to strong earnings and increases in revenue growth and margins. We trimmed our position in Sandisk given the run-up in the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other top-performing holdings were in the Consumer Discretionary sector – General Motors (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GM\" title=\"General Motors Company\">GM</a>) and Expedia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXPE\" title=\"Expedia Group, Inc.\">EXPE</a>). General Motors performed well after posting strong full-year results driven by record truck sales. The company continues to return capital to investors through stock buybacks and dividend increases. Expedia, which was a recent purchase, also posted strong results and raised the outlook going forward. We added to our exposure to Expedia and continue to hold both stocks in the Fund.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jazz Pharmaceuticals (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JAZZ\" title=\"Jazz Pharmaceuticals plc\">JAZZ</a>), in the Health Care sector, was a top performer, advancing nearly 30% driven by strong third quarter performance and positive clinical trial results for one of its cancer drugs. We continue to hold the company in the Fund.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other top contributors included underweights to momentum-based stocks that are in the benchmark, Robinhood Markets (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HOOD\" title=\"Robinhood Markets, Inc.\">HOOD</a>) and Coinbase Global (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COIN\" title=\"Coinbase Global, Inc.\">COIN</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While several Fund holdings struggled – including NewMarket (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NEU\" title=\"NewMarket Corporation\">NEU</a>) in the Materials sector, HP (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPQ\" title=\"HP Inc.\">HPQ</a>) in the Information Technology sector, and Harley-Davidson (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HOG\" title=\"Harley-Davidson, Inc.\">HOG</a>) and PulteGroup (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PHM\" title=\"PulteGroup, Inc.\">PHM</a>) in the Consumer Discretionary sector – the most significant detractor was our underweight to Warner Bros. Discovery (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBD\" title=\"Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.\">WBD</a>), which is in the benchmark and was up nearly 50% on acquisition activity. NewMarket struggled with general weakness in the petroleum additives business, one of the larger portions of its revenue. We continue to hold the stock in the Fund. Harley-Davidson struggled after reporting sharp declines in motorcycle revenue, increased costs, and pricing pressure. We continue to hold Harley-Davidson in the Fund. PulteGroup, in the homebuilding industry, struggled due to slowing orders and margin pressures despite a slight decrease in mortgage rates. We continue to hold PulteGroup in the Fund. HP has not benefited much from the AI frenzy like other technology companies. The company has seen rising costs and projected lower-than-expected earnings for 2026. We did not make any changes to our position in HP and continue to hold the stock in the Fund.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Buys &amp; Sells</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We initiated a position in Garrett Motion (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GTX\" title=\"Garrett Motion Inc.\">GTX</a>), an automotive parts and equipment company in the Consumer Discretionary sector. The company designs, manufactures, and sells turbocharger and electric boosting technologies for commercial vehicles. Garrett ranks high on multiple cash flow and forecast earnings measures on our model. The company typically pays a dividend and has been aggressively buying back stock, which we view positively. Price momentum during the past 12 months has been strong as has operating momentum, placing its momentum scores near the top decile. Overall, the stock ranks in the top 5% in our stock-ranking universe, which led to the fourth quarter purchase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also initiated a position in EnerSys (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENS\" title=\"EnerSys\">ENS</a>) in the Industrials sector. EnerSys designs, manufactures, and distributes energy systems and batteries to customers worldwide. The stock ranks high on multiple cash flow and forecast earnings measure — our two most important blocks of valuation. The company typically pays a dividend and has been aggressively buying back stock, which we view positively. Price momentum over the past 12 months has been strong. In addition, several indicators of operating momentum are also attractive, with improving operating margins and growth in sales. Overall, the stock ranks in the top 5% in our stock-ranking universe, which led to the fourth quarter purchase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We sold our position in Electronic Arts (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EA\" title=\"Electronic Arts Inc.\">EA</a>) in the Communication Services sector. Electronic Arts did well in 2025, advancing approximately 40% for the year. In late September, the company announced an agreement to be acquired by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SVLKF\" title=\"Silver Lake Resources Limited\">SVLKF</a>), and Affinity Partners for $55 billion. The Fund often benefits from takeovers, as the companies we hold tend to be attractively priced, solid businesses that are undervalued, as was the case with Electronic Arts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We trimmed our position in Amkor Technology (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMKR\" title=\"Amkor Technology, Inc.\">AMKR</a>) in the Information Technology sector. Amkor has done well in recent years, benefiting from the surging demand in AI and as a result has become less attractive from a valuation standpoint. While the stock still generates good cash flow, both earnings and cash flow have not kept up with the increase in stock price. Stock price momentum has been very strong but the decline in fundamentals (valuation) led us to sell the position.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sector Underweights and Overweights</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Fund's sector exposures are driven by valuations, as we will overweight those sectors where we find the most attractive stocks from a valuation standpoint and underweight those sectors and industries where we have difficulty finding cheap stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Fund's most significant overweights relative to the value benchmark are to the Consumer Discretionary and Financials sectors. Within the Consumer Discretionary sector, the Fund is overweight homebuilders, automotive parts, automotive retail, and broadline retail. Among Financials, the Fund is overweight consumer finance, commercial &amp; residential mortgage finance, asset management &amp; custody banks, regional banks, and property &amp; casualty insurance. The most significant underweights relative to the value benchmark are to Industrials, Materials, Utilities, and Real Estate.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">U.S. equity markets finished the year strong; however, mid-cap stocks were only slightly positive in the fourth quarter and up just over 10% for the year compared to nearly 18% for the S&amp;P 500 Index. Markets in 2025 were led by almost anything AI-related, driving up valuations for chipmakers and software firms building AI platforms. While technology-related stocks saw the largest gains, other sectors of the market also benefited from the broadening of the market advance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even though AI-related technology stocks may appear priced to perfection, we continue to identify opportunities among mid- and smaller-capitalization value stocks. The Fund has outperformed the value benchmark in four of the past five years, with the only exception being 2024, when the Fund matched the return of the value benchmark. Even with strong relative performance, the Fund remains attractively priced relative to the benchmark. The Fund seeks to hold high-quality, profitable companies that generate cash, pay dividends, and repurchase shares. While large-cap U.S. stocks appear quite expensive, the mid- and small-cap segments of the market continue to trade at attractive multiples, particularly value-oriented stocks.

Stock markets are volatile and equity values can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market and economic conditions. The value of securities selected using quantitative analysis can react differently to issuer, political, market, and economic developments than the market as a whole or securities selected using only fundamental analysis. The factors used in quantitative analysis and the weight placed on those factors may not be predictive of a security's value. In addition, any model may contain flaws or the model may not perform as anticipated.

(If either the portfolio or the benchmark has no position in a given group, allocation effect is the lone effect.) A group's allocation effect equals the average percent capitalization of the portfolio's group minus the average percent cap of the benchmark's group times the total return of the benchmark group minus the total return of the benchmark.</p> <p>Average Weight is the dollar value (price times the shares held) of the security or group, divided by the total dollar value of the entire portfolio displayed as a percentage. It is calculated as the simple arithmetic average of daily values.</p> <p>Contribution to Return is the contribution of a security or group to the overall portfolio return. It is calculated as the security weight multiplied by the daily security return linked daily across the reporting period.</p> <p>Currency Contribution is Total Return in USD subtracting out the Local Returns.</p> <p>Local Returns are the Total Return of the portfolio or benchmark using the local currency.</p> <p>Selection Effect is the portion of portfolio excess return attributable to choosing different securities within groups from the benchmark. A group's security selection effect equals the average weight of the benchmark's group times the total return of the portfolio's group minus the total return of the benchmark's group.</p> <p>Total Effect is the sum of Allocation Effect and Selection Effect. The total effect represents the opportunity cost of what was done in a group relative to the overall portfolio. It is not just the difference between percent contribution in the portfolio and benchmark. At the overall portfolio level, the two numbers are equal. At the group level, they can be different.</p> <p>Total Return is the price change of a security or group including dividends accrued over the report period (or the in-portfolio return) which includes only the time period that each security was in the portfolio.</p> </td></tr></table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-presentation paywall-full-content\" data-id=\"123074\" data-name=\"Index 1_Index 2_merged.pdf\"></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.harborcapital.com/static/eaf8946f93f506ec5b07f55487b0830e/Mid_Cap_Value_Fund_Quarterly_Report.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

This is a good opportunity to see where the business itself stands, but also importantly a chance to reexamine the Bitcoin side of things, because the price of Bitcoins in February of 2026 isn’t what it was even a few short months ago.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth Is Meaningful, But Bitcoin Losses Are the Story in Q4</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After positive quarters in which Hut 8’s profits were more or less entirely a function of their digital assets (which is to say, Bitcoin) appreciating in value, Q4 saw them not just turn to loss, but decidedly so. Once again, the bottom line is driven overwhelmingly by what the price of Bitcoin did, going down in this case.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Q4 2024</p></td> <td><p>Q4 2025</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Revenue</p></td> <td><p>$31.7 million</p></td> <td><p>$88.5 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Gross Profit</p></td> <td><p>$11.4 million</p></td> <td><p>$53.5 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Gain on Digital Assets</p></td> <td><p>$308 million</p></td> <td><p>($402 million)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Operating Income</p></td> <td><p>$282 million</p></td> <td><p>($435 million)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Net Income</p></td> <td><p>$152 million</p></td> <td><p>($280 million)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Adjusted EBITDA</p></td> <td><p>$311 million</p></td> <td><p>($348 million)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>GAAP EPS</p></td> <td><p>$1.37</p></td> <td><p>($2.53)</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20412645-hut-8-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results\">press release</a> from Q4 earnings)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top line growth is meaningful year over year here, of course, but once again the Gain on Digital Assets line dwarfs everything else, and by the time we get to net income we’re left with either positive earnings that are exclusively from that gain, as in 2024, or a net loss that is the loss on digital assets compounded with further operating losses from the rest of the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One could argue, indeed, that the earnings we were seeing in past quarters are largely illusory, because the gains are entirely on paper in estimations of what digital assets are worth, and since the company never seems willing to divest those assets when they appreciate, they’re just gains until we get a quarter like this past one, where the price drops and suddenly they’re booking a loss.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Which isn’t to say that the Bitcoin holdings are worthless. As Hut 8 moves to redefine itself away from its crypto business they managed to bring in some positive cash flow from the creation of the American Bitcoin stock. But such gains are not something we can expect them to be able to repeat, nor are they something to judge the overall business around.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash Flow and the Margins of the Business</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Putting aside the Bitcoin question for a minute, we should look at a breakdown of the revenue by different segments of the company. The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874565-hut-8-corp-hut-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">conference call comment</a> was quite accurate declaring that Compute is the company’s “real growth engine” of the company’s business, and indeed, as it grows the margin of that segment has remained the strongest.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Revenue</p></td> <td><p>Cost</p></td> <td><p>Margin</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Power</p></td> <td><p>$5.0 million</p></td> <td><p>$5.4 million</p></td> <td><p>(8.0%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Digital Infrastructure</p></td> <td><p>$1.6 million</p></td> <td><p>$1.4 million</p></td> <td><p>12.5%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Compute</p></td> <td><p>$81.9 million</p></td> <td><p>$28.2 million</p></td> <td><p>65.6%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total</p></td> <td><p>$88.5 million</p></td> <td><p>$35.0 million</p></td> <td><p>60.5%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20412645-hut-8-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-results\">press release</a> from Q4 earnings)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From the point of view of revenue, Compute is by far the largest source, and the highest margin of the bunch. The revenue more than doubled year over year, from $31.7 million in 2024, and the margin maintained strength. So long as they are able to continue to grow the Compute segment going forward, it’s clear that’s the right decision to focus on, and the company seems to believe that AI demand for such services is going to allow them to grow that capacity into 2026 and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, Hut 8 stands as an over $6 billion market cap company, and for the entire fiscal year, their overall revenue was only $235 million, with gross costs of around $108 million. That’s a price/sales of 26.07, which is both enormous compared to the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUT/valuation/metrics\">sector median</a> of 3.20 and much higher than Hut 8’s own 5-year average of 9.95.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That problem is compounded because once you get through the gross costs and into the operating costs, that revenue is more than entirely burned through. Noteworthy is that operating cash flow in 2025 actually was worse, even though the revenue and gross margin were substantially higher.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>FY 2024</p></td> <td><p>FY 2025</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Revenue</p></td> <td><p>$162 million</p></td> <td><p>$235 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Gross Profit</p></td> <td><p>$75.8 million</p></td> <td><p>$127 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Operating Cash Flow</p></td> <td><p>($68.5 million)</p></td> <td><p>($139 million)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Investing Cash Flow</p></td> <td><p>($188 million)</p></td> <td><p>($754 million)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Financing Cash Flow</p></td> <td><p>$312 million</p></td> <td><p>$856 million</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(source: Latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/170426851\">10-K</a> from SEC)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Herein lies the problem: Hut 8 is growing, but the top line revenue is still paltry for a company their size, and that growth isn’t bringing them closer to operating break-even so far. When trying estimate the underlying value of Hut 8 we have to include not only their tangible assets, which are largely Bitcoins and depreciating equipment, but also what the cash generation potential of the business is actually worth. In this case, the latter is seemingly worth very little at present. That could change, but for now, it’s not a $6 billion business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the other cash flow lines, we see Investing Cash Flow is strongly negative, both because of substantial CapEx in both years ($120 million in 2024 and roughly $197 million in 2025) which, again, operations aren’t able to pay for, and because they continue to spend large amounts of money buying more Bitcoins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Financing Cash Flow line is where Hut 8 is ultimately paying for all this, and in both cases that included issuing more debt, though also issuing more shares of common stock, which is obviously going to have dilutive consequences for investors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Underlying Value on the Balance Sheet</h2> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p>Cash and Equivalents</p></td> <td><p>$44.9 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Current Assets</p></td> <td><p>$408 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Total Current Liabilities</p></td> <td><p>$376 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Digital Assets</p></td> <td><p>$1.3 billion</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Property and Equipment</p></td> <td><p>$643 million</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Shareholder Equity</p></td> <td><p>$1.42 billion</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">(source: Latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/170426851\">10-K</a> from SEC)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hut 8 has a modest balance sheet all told, in that they have a not great but sufficient current ratio of 1.09, and a price/book ratio of 4.31, which isn’t hugely higher than the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUT/valuation/metrics\">sector median</a> of 3.51.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">None of this would be immediately objectionable if Hut 8 was a business with positive operating cash flow. With that not being the case, however, valuation has to be justified almost entirely through digital assets. That raises the question of both risk and potential upside, and we find that despite restructuring itself substantially, that’s still a matter of Bitcoin prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We saw in Q4 that if Bitcoin prices depreciate bottom line is going to go down with it, irrespective of how the rest of the company is executing. On the other hand, if Bitcoin prices quickly rebounded and tested new highs, history suggests that investors would reward Hut 8 shareholders on the basis on the substantial assets they’re holding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside of the digital assets, however, there’s not much here, as Hut 8 also has growing debt and equipment that includes a lot of the type of technology that depreciates rapidly over time. Here again, a balance sheet with a lot of such equipment would be easier to justify if Hut 8 was using that equipment to generate cash flow, but so far they simply aren’t.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hope Springs Eternal Even If Bitcoin Doesn’t</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hut 8 has growth prospects in its business, and conceivably there is a future in which their GPU-as-a-service business model grows to the point that they are able to generate good cash flow with it. The gross margin in their Compute segment reflects that. It’s just right now that segment is far too small for a company of their size, and growth remains a work in progress.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m going to reiterate a hold rating on Hut 8, even though I feel that the stock is as it stands somewhat overpriced for what you’re getting, because the growth potential of their business can’t be discounted, and the market seemingly is willing to pay a substantial multiple for exposure to Bitcoin price increases. I honestly think the path of least resistance for Bitcoin bulls would be to buy Bitcoins, but clearly there is a market for miners, and even in the case of Hut 8, former miners.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Q4 conference call shows that the corporate officers remains highly bullish about the direction they’re taking Hut 8. I don’t think the current share price is particularly enticing, but those who believe in the business model should keep a close eye on how they grow and, importantly, how soon they are able to get to operating break-even, because the future of this company depends heavily on getting there.</p>",
