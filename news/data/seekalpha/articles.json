AI positioning remains crowded, rate<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> cycles are diverging across regions, and dispersion within cyclicals is increasing. At the same time, industrial capex is reaccelerating and fiscal measures are beginning to pull forward demand.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the first quarter progresses, we examine where active managers are expressing optimism, where they are reducing risk, and where they see new opportunity. The message is consistent: conviction in core themes remains intact, but implementation is more disciplined. Managers are refining exposures rather than expanding them.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI remains core, but exposure is shifting</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Managers remain comfortable underwriting a longer-duration AI investment cycle. Industrial and manufacturing spending continues to rise, supported by automation upgrades and deferred investment returning to the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positioning reflects a deliberate effort to manage crowding risk. Oversized positions in hyperscalers and some infrastructure names have been trimmed, alongside profit-taking in prior leaders. Early-stage AI and SaaS names that rallied sharply in 2025 remain underweight across many portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capital is being redirected toward more targeted exposures:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Global memory producers, where allocations rose meaningfully into year-end</li> <li>Semiconductor and hardware supply chains in Asia, tied to processing, electrification, and advanced compute</li> <li>Enterprise adopters and service integrators with visible returns on AI spend</li> <li>Peripheral beneficiaries across electronic components, materials, machinery, and construction</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among long-short managers, gross AI exposure was seasonally reduced into year-end, though net exposure remained constructive. Rotation, not broad deleveraging, marked the shift.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, managers remain committed to the AI cycle, but with tighter underwriting and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4868078-market-signals-separating-wheat-from-chaff\" rel=\"noopener\">greater sensitivity to earnings durability</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cyclicals advance with valuation discipline</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sentiment across financials and industrials continues to improve. Several value managers believe an upgrade and replacement cycle is forming after years of deferred capital spending. Still, valuation discipline remains central for such participants.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">European banks and U.S. industrial leaders that drove much of the rebound are being selectively trimmed as multiples approach upper ranges. Managers remain constructive on the cycle, though position sizes are being recalibrated, and capital is being recycled into less extended names.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Germany’s fiscal expansion is viewed as highly structural, driving allocations into defense, infrastructure, and niche industrial and technology firms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conversely, the UK has emerged as a contrarian opportunity. Wide valuation dispersion and limited mega-cap AI concentration are creating differentiated opportunities in domestic and SMID-cap stocks. Managers are seeking alternative ideas in a market less dominated by narrow technology stocks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revisiting quality and income</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After prolonged underperformance, selective bottom-up investors are quietly picking up <a href=\"https://russellinvestments.com/content/ri/us/en/insights/russell-research/2026/01/january-global-equity-brief.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">quality defensives</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These managers have added exposure to consumer staples, healthcare, and property and casualty insurers, many of which are trading near multi-year lows. Dividend support and lower-beta characteristics are attractive risk/rewards, playing a role as portfolios balance cyclical exposure with fundamental resilience.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Durable growth franchises are also screening well. Diversified financials, niche equipment companies, and scaled consumer brands serving higher-income cohorts are favored for their earnings durability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Among those consumer names, exposure is becoming segmented. Companies tied to travel, retirement living, and premium brands are preferred. Businesses reliant on middle- and lower-income consumers require deeper valuation support before becoming more appealing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emerging markets show clear divergence</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emerging markets positioning has become more selective as dispersion widens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Brazil has moved firmly into overweight territory following severe deratings. Both growth and value managers are adding exposure, favoring financials and industrials, supported by an easing rate cycle and improving real incomes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Asia, allocations to South Korea remain high as managers seek out critical AI bottlenecks, particularly in memory and advanced processing supply chains. Taiwan also has a central role here in terms of next-generation compute and electrification.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Managers remain highly selective on China, focusing on companies with earnings recovery or those with competitive strengths in automation and advanced manufacturing. However, property oversupply and fragmentation limit broader conviction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ASEAN markets face headwinds. Indonesia and the Philippines, for example, continue to struggle with high real rates and slow policy transmission, prompting managers to remain patient and valuation-sensitive.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investor implications</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we move deeper into 2026, equity managers are cautiously confident. Core themes remain intact, but implementation is more refined. AI exposure is broadening beyond crowded leaders, cyclicals are being managed with valuation discipline, and emerging market allocations offer active opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Improving breadth and disciplined rotation reinforce the case for active management. In a concentrated market backdrop, selective positioning and valuation awareness remain central to capturing opportunity while managing risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>These views are subject to change at any time based upon market or other conditions and are current as of the date at the top of the page.

This is a managed fund that was created to hold substantially all of its assets in physical gold and silver bullion but \"without the inconvenience that is typical of a direct investment in physical gold bullion,\" according to the fund's </span><a href=\"https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/exchange-listed-products/physical-bullion-funds/gold-and-silver/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">website</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the past year or so, this has been one of my best calls and top performers in my portfolio. In fact, this story has continued as 2026 has gotten underway. Since my last <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855452-cef-another-fresh-high-and-further-gains-likely-to-follow\">review</a> a few months ago, CEF has performed strongly. It has outpaced equities and risen higher along with the surge in precious metals more broadly:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719472353862948.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Fund Performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"267\" height=\"205\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719472353862948.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Fund Performance <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rapid gains always make me a little hesitant, so I figured I should take another look at CEF as we push deeper into the new year. Of course, this rise is actually small compared to how well the fund has performed over a longer stretch. The fact is that precious metals (gold and especially silver) have been on a strong bull run, and this momentum has continued. There was a sharp sell-off a few weeks ago, but we have mostly seen a resumption in gains since then.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For multiple reasons, momentum being one of them, I still see a path higher for CEF. I think the fund's valuation, exposure to what central banks are buying, and the continued weakening of the USD are all supporting factors. I will take a turn discussing each in detail below and use them to support my \"buy\" rating on the fund.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Opportunity For Emerging Markets \"Catch-Up\"</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps the primary reason I started buying gold years ago - and continue to buy it today - has to do with my desire to \"copy\" the central banks. I believe retail investors can benefit from a similar \"don't fight the central banks\" mantra in the same way we used to say \"don't fight the Fed\".</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason I say this is because central banks have become large buyers of gold globally. This has been a consistent theme and has accelerated in the past couple of years. Notable reasons have to do with the Russian invasion of Ukraine (which resulted in Russian assets being frozen and prompted other nations to hedge against this through buying metals), the decline of the US dollar in value, and rising trade and geopolitical risks globally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of note, it isn't just developed nations buying gold either. China has become a major player, and so too have other emerging markets (EMs). This, to me, is really where the opportunity lies. If China and other EMs decide to mirror the developed world in terms of their percentage of gold as a reserve, that will mean a substantial amount of buying in the future:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-17718632620169106_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"689\" data-height=\"445\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-17718632620169106_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Gold Reserves (As A Percent of Total)\" width=\"640\" height=\"413\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-17718632620169106_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-17718632620169106_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-17718632620169106_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-17718632620169106_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Gold Reserves (As A Percent of Total) <span>(World Gold Council)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I emphasize this for two reasons. One, this is a tremendous amount of buying pressure that I think will set gold up nicely for a prolonged multi-year run. Two, central banks are largely price agnostic. What I mean is, they aren't necessarily buying gold to turn a profit. As I noted, their objectives could be to protect their government assets from seizure, to hedge against inflation, to use it as a bargaining tool against the US government, among other reasons.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is important because even as gold rises, I don't necessarily see demand slowing down the way it might if the demand was being driven by retail investors (think Bitcoin). While I recognize that CEF is both gold <em>and silver</em>, this is a bigger play on the yellow metal since it makes up almost 59% of total fund assets, as shown below:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-1771969279828551.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CEF's Gold &amp; Silver Holdings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"288\" height=\"160\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-1771969279828551.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CEF's Gold &amp; Silver Holdings <span>(Sprott)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will get to why I like silver as well, but understand this is a big play on gold, and I view that positively. This supports my \"buy\" rating on CEF going forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Discount Has Actually Widened</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A second attribute that supports a bull call for CEF in particular is the fund's valuation. Surprisingly, after a 14% pop in market price, CEF is actually <em>cheaper </em>than it was two months ago. Obviously the share price is higher, but in terms of paying below net asset value (NAV), that opportunity has persisted. Back in December, CEF sat with a discount around 3%. Today, that has widened to over 4.5%:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719693510302315_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"841\" data-height=\"108\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719693510302315_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CEF: Quick Stats\" width=\"640\" height=\"82\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719693510302315_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719693510302315_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719693510302315_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719693510302315_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CEF: Quick Stats <span>(Sprott)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To be fair, that isn't a massive shift. But it is notable given how strongly CEF's market price has performed. This really speaks to the run in both gold and silver and tells me that those who may be lacking in this exposure can still find some relative value in this space by selecting this option.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Silver Demand Should Continue, But It Is More Volatile</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As noted above, CEF has a large exposure to silver. So being a gold bug isn't enough if one decides to buy this fund - you should be excited about silver exposure too!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I myself am in that camp. The reasons are multifold. The case as a hedge against the decline in the USD is intact because silver is indeed a precious metal, as good is. While different, they will both benefit as the USD declines (which I expect), and that suggests I want this exposure long-term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further, silver is also an industrial metal. The demand that comes from their inclusion in industrial applications sets them apart from gold to some degree. That is key to why I think owning <em>both </em>has plenty of merit. There is some overlap in this thesis, to be sure, but the industrial side of things for silver makes it a more diverse asset than gold. As solar panels, electric vehicles, personal electronics, and many other products continue to demand silver as an input, that is going to provide price support for years to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I could go on and on about this theme, but the truth is a photo is worth much more than my words:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719852960415702_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"650\" data-height=\"393\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719852960415702_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Silver Demand Has Been Rising (By Product / Industry)\" width=\"640\" height=\"387\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719852960415702_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719852960415702_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719852960415702_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719852960415702_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Silver Demand Has Been Rising (By Product / Industry) <span>(CME Group)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond just the demand story and the usefulness as a hedge, there is one other key reason I like silver right <strong>now</strong>. While this may sound counterintuitive, I view the sell-off we saw a few weeks back as a sign that a good bit of excess was taken out of the market. While painful in the short run, that can set the stage nicely for a more sustainable rally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But let me be clear. Silver is more volatile than gold (and plenty of other assets). So make sure you understand this and can handle it because it may not be for everyone. To emphasize this point, silver did drop roughly 30% in one day - and that is not something we should ignore:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719837100412354.png?io=w640\" alt=\"YTD Chart (&lt;a href='https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLV' title='iShares Silver Trust ETF'&gt;SLV&lt;/a&gt;)\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"561\" height=\"351\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719837100412354.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719837100412354.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/10779721-17719837100412354.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">YTD Chart (SLV) <span>(Google Finance)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Many may not see this chart and think it is that great, but I would focus on the fact that silver is up 23% year-to-date, and, again, the shaking out of some loose hands can be a positive for a more stable rally going forward. I don't really want to see another 30% drop, but it has already happened, and I am looking to the future with brighter eyes.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bitcoin Losing Its Flare</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another reason I remain a buyer of CEF is because of what it <em>isn't. </em>What I mean by that is this is a hedge I use against volatility and equity drawdowns. But it didn't used to be my only hedge. A few years ago I had a position in Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC\" title=\"Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF\">BTC</a>) and the reason was I saw it becoming a momentum play; it was meant to be an inflation/currency hedge, and institutional interest was growing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, fast forward to today, and BTC is 50% off its high, and its popularity has begun to wane. I am not surprised by this, and I had exited my position in BTC a while back because it simply no longer met my objectives. It has begun to move with the market and other risk-on sectors so that it wasn't really protecting my portfolio in any way. I was fortunate to get out when I did, as many other retail investors have not been so lucky. At last check, quite a few BTC owners are in the red, and the path forward is murkier than it used to be:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-1771863420307838.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Many Retail Buyers Have Losses\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"525\" height=\"274\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-1771863420307838.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-1771863420307838.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/23/10779721-1771863420307838.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Many Retail Buyers Have Losses <span>(Bloomberg)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My point here is that I used to lump BTC along with my precious metals in terms of using them for a similar reason: to hedge against currency debasement and other geopolitical risks. This dynamic is not really the case anymore. Could that change for BTC in the future? Sure. But I'm simply not willing to bank on it for now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I put that money that used to be in BTC to work in precious metals over a year ago, and my fresh cash is going to go to precious metals and not BTC going forward. While this isn't directly tied to CEF, it hopefully explains my thought process and portfolio structure for my followers so they can understand where I am coming from here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CEF and my other metal holdings have been big winners thus far, and I see additional profits headed my way. I see industrial and investment demand remaining high for silver, and gold continues to be hoarded by central banks. Further, CEF has a nice discount to NAV and its stability compared to other options like BTC is exactly what I am looking for. I am therefore keeping my \"buy\" rating on this fund in place, and I would suggest my followers give the idea some consideration at this time.</p>",

Over the last year, it’s shifted into something broader, a business that’s making real money from AI, Cloud and subscriptions, not just clicks on Google. The company’s stock was at $241.03 when I last<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> called it a </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829304-alphabet-has-nailed-ai-but-investors-may-want-to-wait-for-a-pullback\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829304-alphabet-has-nailed-ai-but-investors-may-want-to-wait-for-a-pullback\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hold</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">. Now it’s at $311.7, after hitting $350.15, up more than 30% since the prior Hold rating. That jump was driven by faster growth in Cloud, actual dollars rolling in from AI and more people paying for subscriptions. But the fast run-up in the share price has already priced in a lot of the upside. The numbers now look fair, not cheap, the stock trades at roughly 27 times its expected earnings, putting it right in the middle of the big tech pack, not obviously undervalued, not outrageously expensive either.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If there’s anywhere the market might be missing something, it’s in how much investors assume the recent momentum in AI and Cloud can last, especially with how much Alphabet is spending on new tech and the ongoing risk of regulators stepping in. For 2025, Alphabet’s total revenue hit $403 billion, up 15% from last year. Search grew 17%. Cloud was up a massive 48%, now running at more than $70 billion a year. Net income in 2025 was $34.5 billion, with earnings per share at $2.82 for the quarter and an operating margin of 31.6%, even after taking a $2.1 billion hit from Waymo. The Cloud backlog has more than doubled from last year to $240 billion. Over 325 million people now pay for some Alphabet subscription. The Gemini AI app has north of 750 million monthly active users. These aren’t just flashy stats, they’re steady revenue and show people are actually using the products, with Gemini and other AI tools getting baked into how both consumers and businesses work.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-1771941564748133_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2335\" data-height=\"1205\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-1771941564748133_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Earnings Highlights: Annual revenues exceeded $400B for the first time\" width=\"640\" height=\"330\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"330\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-1771941564748133_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-1771941564748133_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-1771941564748133_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-1771941564748133_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GOOG</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sundar Pichai’s comments back this up.

This quarter, Search continued to accelerate with revenues growing 17%. YouTube’s annual revenues surpassed $60 billion across ads and subscriptions. Cloud significantly accelerated with revenues growing 48%, now on an annual run rate of over $70 billion. Backlog grew by 55% quarter-over-quarter to $240 billion, representing a wide breadth of customers driven by demand for AI products. We have over 325 million paid subscriptions across consumer services with strong adoption for Google One and YouTube Premium. In addition, we have sold more than 8 million paid seats of Gemini Enterprise, which we launched just 4 months ago. And our Gemini app now has over 750 million monthly active users. We are also seeing significantly higher engagement per user, especially since the launch of Gemini 3 in December. Overall, we are seeing our AI investments and infrastructure drive revenue and growth across the board.”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company isn’t flailing around trying to figure out how to make AI pay off. It’s already making serious money from it. Cloud operating income jumped to $5.3 billion, more than double what it was a year ago. Margins went up too, from 17.5% to 30.1%. So it looks like AI is starting to really change how Alphabet makes money. They’re not just spending to build stuff, they’re getting more out of what they’ve already set up, especially as they sell more higher-margin enterprise AI services on top of existing infrastructure. If Cloud margins keep inching up and Search profits don’t slip, then every extra dollar coming in should end up turning into more operating income and free cash flow. That could help balance out higher depreciation costs from all the AI infrastructure and backs up the idea that future free cash flow will have more to do with running things better, not just from big jumps in revenue.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719426095288694_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2335\" data-height=\"1204\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719426095288694_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Google Cloud Revenues and Operating Income\" width=\"640\" height=\"330\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"330\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719426095288694_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719426095288694_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719426095288694_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719426095288694_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GOOG</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG/earnings/estimates\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG/earnings/estimates\" target=\"_blank\">Consensus</a> estimates call for EPS of $13.41 in 2027 and $15.48 in 2028, with revenue projected to reach $540.3 billion and $615.4 billion, respectively.

Cloud’s backlog has jumped to $240 billion, which is more than double last year, so that pipeline is looking solid. The Cloud segment is finally making good money too, operating margin is up to 30.1%. Paid subscriptions stand at 325 million and the new Gemini product is catching on quickly with both regular users and businesses. These help protect Alphabet from the ups and downs in ad spending and they give the company more predictable, recurring revenue.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719453838869302_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2335\" data-height=\"1206\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719453838869302_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Google Services Revenue Breakdown\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"331\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719453838869302_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719453838869302_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719453838869302_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719453838869302_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GOOG</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cost Pressures</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But costs are climbing fast. R&amp;D spending jumped 42% in 2025. Depreciation shot up by almost $6 billion, or 38% more than last year, all because it takes a ton of money to build out the AI infrastructure. Management said, “The significant increase in our investments in technical infrastructure will continue to put pressure on the P&amp;L in the form of higher depreciation expense and related data centers operations costs such as energy.” That’s a real problem, not just a minor bump. If revenue growth slows down, margins could shrink quickly, especially with labor costs still climbing and the company spending big before it actually sees the returns.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719432834811184_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2335\" data-height=\"1206\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719432834811184_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Operating Expenses Breakdown\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"331\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719432834811184_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719432834811184_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719432834811184_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/61476581-17719432834811184_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GOOG</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regulation is still the big thing hanging over Alphabet right now. In Search, the DOJ and state attorneys general already won a ruling and got a final judgment. That means Google has to change how it distributes its services, share some search data and offer syndication services to a few competitors. Both sides are now appealing. On the ad tech side, Alphabet is still waiting for a final judgment in the DOJ’s advertising tech case. The DOJ is talking about possible structural fixes and Alphabet says those could seriously hurt its business. Europe’s also on them. The Commission handed down a €3 billion ad tech decision over “self-preferencing” and told Alphabet to make changes. Alphabet’s appealing that too. With AI now getting pushed more into Search, ads and Cloud, Alphabet says the scrutiny is only going up especially around AI and competition and that regulators can force the company to change its products or business models.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alphabet’s stock sits at $311 now. Looking out to 2026, that puts the forward P/E at about 27. PEG ratio comes in around 1.75. Free cash flow yield is right at 2%. Not much of a bargain anymore. Microsoft’s forward P/E is about 23. Meta’s is around 21. Nvidia? Way up there at 41. So Alphabet is on the pricier side among the big tech names. Investors are already pricing in some AI upside for Alphabet. For the stock to move up a lot from here, Alphabet actually has to show real growth and get those margins higher. Just more excitement won’t cut it. If regulators get involved or if the AI hype drops off, the shares could take a big hit. On the flip side, if regulators step in or the AI story loses steam, the stock could fall a lot.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Take</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alphabet’s setup looks strong, just not without headaches. Their official forecasts and the numbers analysts expect seem fair and the company’s in a good spot to benefit as more businesses move to AI and Cloud. Key stuff to watch: is Cloud still signing up lots of new business; are more people actually using Gemini; and is all this spending on AI systems showing up in profits instead of just making depreciation go up? Regulation is still the wildcard. If things go Alphabet’s way, the stock could get a boost. If not, it could drop fast.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom line: I’m sticking with Hold. Alphabet is running well and the AI and Cloud businesses are making real progress, but the price already reflects most of that future growth. There’s not much room for mistakes, especially around regulation or costs. I’d need to see the stock fall closer to $250, which would imply a P/E multiple more in line with its five-year average, or see clear signs Alphabet’s making more money from AI than anyone expects, before calling it a Buy. Right now, the risk and reward are about even. It’s worth owning, but there’s no need to chase it at this price.</p>",

Well, joining us now to discuss is Michael Brown. He's Vice President, Director, and Portfolio Manager with TD Asset Management.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Michael, great to have you back on the show.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Thank you for having me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Alright, so we've heard that the US Supreme Court has struck down some of those tariffs, and that Washington responded by enacting a new 10% global tariff. So, what does that mean for Europe and Asia going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Well, firstly, 10% is better than the 15% he talked on the weekend. I mean, right now, it would be modestly positive. I mean, uncertainty still continues with the tariffs, particularly in Asia, countries like China and India. This is a significant, at least temporary, reduction in the tariffs they're paying.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But I mean, the outlook is, as we all know, this administration has talked quite regularly about tariffs being part of their policy agenda, and so, they will likely find another way to bring them into the discussions. But it is a temporary reprieve for particularly China and India as it drops to 10%. Other uncertainty would be for countries like Japan and Korea, who have made tentative deals. What happens to the status of those deals done under the framework that the Supreme Court has ruled out? So really, continued uncertainty, but at least temporarily, it's a bit-- 10% is lower than what they were paying, or what was being paid previously.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> OK, so let's talk about something else that also made headlines. Japan, they just recently had an election that's created a lot of headlines. Explain to us what happened there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Well, basically, the LDP has won a supermajority. So it's the largest, led by Sanae Takaichi.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> You said that very well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Pardon me. It has won the largest majority, really, in the post-war era in Japan, so even larger than Shinzo Abe's major wins in the early 2010s. And so, it's very positive in terms of they have a clear agenda that they can get passed. They can focus on return on their policy as opposed to necessarily, say, buying votes through policy, which is good. There's no concerns the budget will easily pass.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are all positive for Japan going forward. It removes an element of uncertainty in terms of the fiscal agenda, which is great.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> OK, so you said it removes some of the uncertainty and there are benefits to that. But talk about some of the risks of this supermajority.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> I mean, with the ability to change the constitution, I would say that as investors, the biggest risk would be choosing nationalistic interests over economic interests. Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution, also known as the pacifist clause, has gotten a lot of headlines as several prior prime ministers have tried to change it. Essentially, it creates an ambiguity around Japan's right to defend themselves. And with the supermajority, they have the ability to change the constitution. This will likely lead to increased tensions with China. I think we saw a symptom of this last night when China released, I think it was 20 companies in Japan with export restrictions. So...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> OK. And now what about the potential opportunities for investors going forward?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> I mean, the upside right now, I'd say one of the biggest ones, they've talked about consumption tax going to zero on food. This would be positive for overall consumption. I doubt people are going to spend more on food. They're just going to have more money to spend on other things besides food, so that should be positive for consumption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There's also positives with the infrastructure rollout. She's talked about nuclear restarts. Cheaper power is good for economic growth. So that would be positive for, say, construction engineering names. Kajima (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KAJMY\" title=\"Kajima Corporation\">KAJMY</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KAJMF\" title=\"Kajima Corporation\">KAJMF</a>) would be an example. There's four or five of them that are quite similar. There's also-- it will be positive for defense companies, the same list that was listed, the release from China last night.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Are there any names that specifically stand out for you?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Mitsubishi Heavy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MHVYF\" title=\"Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.\">MHVYF</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MHVIY\" title=\"Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.\">MHVIY</a>) would be a name. IHI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IHICY\" title=\"IHI Corporation\">IHICY</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IHICF\" title=\"IHI Corporation\">IHICF</a>) would be another name. And those would be two of the larger defense names within Japan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> And in terms of the sectors that you're focused on, would they be-- you said defense. Is there any other sectors that you'd be focused on?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Largely in industrial space. And then, of course, part of the fiscal stimulus would be the technology sector in Japan. That's led by semiconductor capital equipment. Tokyo Electron would be a prime beneficiary of that there. But there are other names, whether it be Disco Corp. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DSCSY\" title=\"Disco Corporation\">DSCSY</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DISPF\" title=\"Disco Corporation\">DISPF</a>), Lasertec (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LSRCF\" title=\"Lasertec Corporation\">LSRCF</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LSRCY\" title=\"Lasertec Corporation\">LSRCY</a>). Many of them have fancy names. So...</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Anthony Okolie:</strong> Some names we'll be focused on going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Michael Brown:</strong> Yeah, it would be technology, industrials. And hopefully some relief in consumer, but that's not an area that we're focused in.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.moneytalkgo.com/video/a-global-view-on-investing-as-new-tariffs-come-into-effect/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p>",

Notably, the company’s management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869424-nebius-group-n-v-nbis-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">stated</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Demand remains robust, and our pipeline continues to grow substantially. We sold out of capacity in Q3 and Q4 last year, and we're already now in Q1 of 2026 also sold out. In Q4, we delivered group revenue of $228 million, representing year-over-year growth of 547%. Revenue grew 56% from Q3 to Q4. Annualized run rate revenue for the core business stood at $1.2 billion at the end of December, exceeding the high end of our Q3 guidance range of $1.1 billion. The results of our core AI cloud business were even more impressive. Revenue grew 830% year-over-year and 63% quarter-over-quarter.

Before moving to the last major insights, let me highlight the company’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869424-nebius-group-n-v-nbis-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">statement below</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>In terms of deal trends, they're all moving in the right direction. Deal terms are getting longer and average deal sizes are increasing. In Q4, we saw nearly twice as many transactions completed over 12 months in duration over what we succeeded with in Q3, while average selling prices increased by more than 50%.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, NBIS almost doubled its contract with a duration of over 12 months in Q4<span></span> '25, compared to Q3<span></span> '25. Also, average selling prices (ASP) increased by more than 50% in the same period, in combination with higher average deal sizes. This means longer-duration contracts, with more GPUs and general hardware per client, at higher prices, reflecting the company’s pricing power and strong growth trajectory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, Nebius maintains impressive momentum, driven by its expanding data center and AI infrastructure business, which continues to run at full capacity; therefore, I expect Nebius’ revenue growth to remain strong.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond Hardware, NBIS’ Software Could Be the Main Growth Catalyst</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s main revenue comes from building full-stack infrastructure services. However, many investors believe that Nebius only develops and leases its own data centers, but the truth is that it also offers full software solutions and not only bare metal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, the company’s management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869424-nebius-group-n-v-nbis-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">stated</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>At this stage, 100% of our AI cloud customers are utilizing our AI cloud software, obviously. So we have a 100% attach rate. We're very excited, by the way, about the new products that we've launched like Token Factory and the Aether releases, which have opened up TAM and give us an opportunity to expand into enterprise. Our new acquisition of Tavily also extends our platform capabilities by providing agentic search for AI developers, creating more routes into accounts… We're really in the early stages of our monetization journey, but our software and services make our platform sticky, which enables us to charge more on a relative per GPU hour. We are exploring other monetization models, including consumption based such as per token pricing with Token Factory.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me break down the above statements:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>NBIS, in combination with its AI hardware infrastructure, offers AI cloud software solutions through Aether, which helps orchestrate and manage AI workloads. The important point is that all of its clients use Aether.</li> <li>With <a href=\"https://nebius.com/services/token-factory\" rel=\"nofollow\">Token Factory</a>, NBIS expands its TAM, in my view, as small and mid-sized enterprises and startups can leverage the platform to customize, deploy, and optimize open-source AI models. The company monetizes Token Factory under a consumption-based model. According to the company, clients that use the Token Factory platform see <a href=\"https://nebius.com/newsroom/nebius-launches-nebius-token-factory-to-deliver-production-ai-inference-at-scale\" rel=\"nofollow\">cost reductions of up to 70%</a> compared to other models, along with latency reductions of 70%.</li> <li> <a href=\"https://nebius.com/solutions/agentic-search\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tavily</a> is a tool for developers that enables AI agents to have access to real-time data from the web. This allows AI models to search for up-to-date information and not be limited to information that is used for training purposes. Nebius, through Tavily’s acquisition, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869424-nebius-group-n-v-nbis-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">gains access</a> to 700K developers and many Fortune 500 customers, creating cross-selling opportunities and potentially lower customer acquisition costs (ACA), as it has significant exposure to large companies.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730923116963_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1522\" data-height=\"747\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730923116963_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NBIS hardware and software solutions\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"314\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730923116963_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730923116963_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730923116963_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730923116963_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Nebius’ Site</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, Nebius is not only a seller of hardware solutions but also a “one-stop shop” for AI solutions. Still, bare-metal solutions remain the company’s main growth driver; however, it is well positioned to leverage its AI software products. With a 100% attach rate in AI cloud software solutions, increasing selling prices, and longer contract durations, NBIS appears to have a very sticky business model, which I believe is under the radar of Wall Street’s analysts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation and Risk Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nebius seems undervalued compared to its main competitor, CoreWeave (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWV\" title=\"CoreWeave, Inc.\">CRWV</a>), based on FWD EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA ratios, while it seems slightly overvalued based on FWD P/S ratios. These mixed valuation signals do not reflect the fact that NBIS expects significantly higher triple-digit growth over the next two years compared to CRWV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-1771973359793738.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Key metrics comparison with major peer\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"410\" height=\"294\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-1771973359793738.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-1771973359793738.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Analysis’ Results</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors need to understand NBIS’s business model to assess the company’s risks and valuation position. Analysts have an average price target of about $147, which means a potential 44% upside from the current stock price. In my opinion, this target price reflects only the company’s hardware solutions. Therefore, considering its AI software cross-selling opportunities, I believe a fair target price should be closer to $200.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730919735312_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1062\" data-height=\"328\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730919735312_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Target price\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"198\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730919735312_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730919735312_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730919735312_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/62149212-17719730919735312_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding risk assessment, as I already mentioned in my last coverage, NBIS continues to minimize execution risks significantly, given that it has already <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869424-nebius-group-n-v-nbis-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">serviced</a> its contract with Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) and delivered the first tranche of its commitment to Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) on time.

As developed markets face elevated volatility and slower<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> momentum, investors are increasingly turning to emerging economies for diversification, higher yields, and exposure to long-term structural growth themes.</span></strong></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>How monetary policy, commodity trends, and capital flows</strong> shaped emerging market performance in 2025 - and why these forces remain central to the 2026 outlook.</li> <li> <strong>The regional stories driving returns</strong>: from China’s policy direction and semiconductor strength in Korea and Taiwan to domestic demand boosting measures in Indonesia, Thailand, and India.</li> <li> <strong>Why geopolitical shifts and currency dynamics</strong> are enhancing the appeal of emerging markets, offering diversification at a time of elevated volatility and continued uncertainty in developed markets.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emerging market indices delivered a strong performance in 2025, supported by the rate-cut cycle that began in developed markets in 2024 and prompted investors to seek higher yields. Output growth in many emerging economies continues to outpace that of developed markets, whether inflation trends are disinflationary – as in China – or remain relatively sticky – as in Brazil. Higher economic growth and elevated country risk typically translate into higher interest rates, and the prospect of stronger returns attracted significant capital inflows. At the same time, volatility in developed markets - driven partly by fluctuations in US tariff rates – altered risk profiles and added to concerns around slower growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>msci em and crude oil price</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"868\" data-height=\"570\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"msci em and crude oil price\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"420\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720993840748365_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, investors in search of safe-haven assets moved towards gold, while more risk-tolerant investors favoured emerging market equities. Metals also rallied strongly, benefitting countries with significant exposure to commodities. Chile and China, for instance, gained from the appreciation of copper and aluminium, respectively. The gold rally supported mining stocks, especially in South Africa, where rising gold prices bolstered the performance of domestic gold miners. By contrast, the outlook was more mixed for countries dependent on agricultural exports such as cocoa, sugar and cotton, which experienced price corrections.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">aluminium, copper and gold prices</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720994446505866_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"889\" data-height=\"567\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720994446505866_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"aluminium, copper and gold prices\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"408\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720994446505866_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720994446505866_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720994446505866_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720994446505866_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The economic uncertainty following the tariff-related “Liberation Day” declared by President Trump also raised questions about the traditional safe-haven status of US treasuries and the US dollar. A weaker dollar can make higher-yielding currencies more attractive, increasing the appeal of emerging markets. The markets also offer geographical diversification at a time when tariff exposure and geopolitical tensions remain significant. Emerging economies with limited trade surpluses with the US may be particularly well placed to help hedge against geopolitical risks.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">geopolitical risk and volatility index</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"894\" data-height=\"563\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"geopolitical risk and volatility index\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"403\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720995032021976_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Export-driven economies – such as South Korea, Taiwan, and China – are still exposed to potential tariff changes as the US administration continues to focus on reducing its trade deficit. However, these economies hold competitive positions in advanced manufacturing. Recent earnings from SK Hynix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HXSC.F\" title=\"SK hynix Inc.\">HXSC.F</a>) illustrate the continued strength of Korean semiconductor demand. Similar momentum is evident in China and Taiwan, where the semiconductors, telecommunications and AI-related sectors remain important contributors to market performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In December, Chinese policymakers met at the annual Central Economic Work Conference to outline the economic agenda for 2026. Key priorities included stimulating consumption and investment to support growth of around 5%. One challenge highlighted was the imbalance between strong domestic supply and weak domestic demand. Despite a record trade surplus in 2025, internal demand remains subdued. Authorities aim to revive investment following a slowdown in the second half of the year, with an emphasis on strengthening domestic-focused activity rather than prioritising the export-oriented manufacturing sector, which has remained resilient. China’s budget deficit target is expected to stay close to last year's record 4% of GDP, reflecting sustained public spending to support demand during the ongoing residential property downturn. Liquidity injections through lower reserve-requirement ratios and targeted interest rate reductions are likely, although any monetary easing is expected to be incremental.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chinese equity indices</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"873\" data-height=\"565\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chinese equity indices\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"414\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/50624080-17720999915349329_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Shanghai Composite Index rose 18% last year, its strongest annual performance since 2020. Between 2021 and 2025, technology companies represented over 90% of new listings in China, and the sector now accounts for more than a quarter of total market capitalisation. In 2025, the MSCI China gained 28%, while the CSI 300 rose 18%. Forecasts suggest further gains in 2026, supported by AI and technology-driven momentum, even though household confidence remains muted. Chinese equities continue to offer diversification benefits, with a reasonably generally constructive macroeconomic backdrop. Chinese sovereign yields are expected to stay range-bound, constrained by disinflationary forces on the upside and a less accommodative monetary stance on the downside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In South Korea, a significant share of equities continues to trade below book value. Ongoing efforts to improve corporate governance could help unlock value, with Japan’s experience offering potential guide for attracting foreign investment. China’s actions to curb disorderly price competition and address inefficiencies among producers may also support market performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Elsewhere in Asia, Indonesia and Thailand could see further gains in 2026, supported by policies aimed at strengthening domestic demand. Handouts to low-income households and expansionary fiscal measures are expected to bolster consumption and underpin growth in Indonesia. India has also introduced measures to support household spending, including reforms to goods and services taxes. However, Indian equities underperformed other emerging markets in 2025. High valuations, higher-than-expected tariffs, and pressures on the software sector could delay a broader recovery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For Saudi Arabia, despite expectations of softer oil prices, equities may benefit from the potential relaxation of foreign-ownership limits on listed companies. This reform could generate passive inflows estimated at up to $10 billion and may help lift a market that, like India, lagged broader emerging market performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, emerging markets are well positioned for 2026. Volatility in developed markets is likely to remain above historical norms, and geopolitical tensions – particularly in the run-up to the US mid-term elections – are expected to persist. Structural trends, including the central role of key Asian economies in global supply chains and the favourable outlook for selected commodities, should continue to support emerging-market performance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Legal Disclaimer</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Republication or redistribution of LSE Group content is prohibited without our prior written consent.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>The content of this publication is for informational purposes only and has no legal effect, does not form part of any contract, does not, and does not seek to constitute advice of any nature and no reliance should be placed upon statements contained herein.

By design, these companies have to depend on external capital to develop (since they have to pay most of what they make as dividends), while the SOFR takes into account much more than just what the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"fed\" htloopnumber=\"354047045\">Fed</em> does.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we can see in GLPI's case, their latest debt issuance from back in August 2025 came with coupons of 5.25% ($600 million 2033 notes) and 5.75% ($700 million 2037 notes), and although this pushed their maturities significantly, these are still relatively high yields, while issuing stock still costs about 6.5% nowadays, which limits their ability to deliver significant accretion through investments, with an 8.51% weighted average cap rate they expect on their future pipeline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although we’re talking about a theoretically much more limited and slower growth environment (especially due to the rise of online and potential regulatory limitations), the industry is also facing the trends seen in the country’s general real estate, with the post-pandemic boom in construction now reverting due to weak occupancy rates and rising costs seen all across the board, from workforce and materials to debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, GLPI continues to have a very strong pipeline with attractive cap rates, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872978-gaming-and-leisure-properties-inc-glpi-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872978-gaming-and-leisure-properties-inc-glpi-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">recently highlighting</a> their “$2.6 billion of future capital commitments poised for deployment over the next 24 months,” with mega-projects such as Bally's Lincoln and Chicago, Live!

Jokes aside, iGaming can be a way for traditional operators to not only attract new people and diversify (especially the big players), but also promote their physical operations as needed, although I continue to believe that these companies should focus especially on the experience as a whole. Similarly, GLPI can also expand more into the leisure side, having the capital, size, and experience to develop there as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another potential issue comes from the weak travel data, with <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4539192-online-travel-stocks-slide-on-weak-international-tourism-data\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4539192-online-travel-stocks-slide-on-weak-international-tourism-data\" target=\"_blank\">recent <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"us\" htloopnumber=\"354047045\">US</em> tourism data</a> highlighting that even though global tourism spending grew by 6.7% in 2025, the <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"us\" htloopnumber=\"354047045\">US</em> actually fell by 6% in terms of foreign visitors and 7% in international tourist spending, likely caused by all the uncertainty around politics, visas, budget issues, etc., although at the same time, <a href=\"https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/bed/domestic-trips-by-us-residents/3672/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/bed/domestic-trips-by-us-residents/3672/\" target=\"_blank\">domestic travel continued to recover</a> to a new record based on recent data.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks Reiterated</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite their solid position and strong growth pipeline, GLPI will always depend on the economy, and the current environment has plenty of room to get even worse, potentially affecting the company’s tenants, and worsening their ratings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, a higher-for-longer rate environment remains a significant threat for GLPI, potentially limiting the results of their investments and ultimately their valuation, as the market can still find a very solid risk-adjusted yield through treasuries and “tax” the stock price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/60669497-17719480331821375_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"728\" data-height=\"338\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/60669497-17719480331821375_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Gaming and Leisure Properties IR GLPI stock analysis seekingalpha valuation 2026 best reit stocks to buy vici stock\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"297\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/60669497-17719480331821375_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/60669497-17719480331821375_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/60669497-17719480331821375_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/60669497-17719480331821375_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

To elaborate, while the broader memory market will likely only grow at 7% through the next decade, the MRAM market is expected to grow at a pace of 4x more, at +30% levels!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MRAM, I feel, will see plenty of takers, as it is something of a disruptor technology that seeks to combine the best of what NAND Flash, SRAM and DRAM have to offer. What if you could have a technology that infuses the cost economics of volatile memory such as DRAM, the superior access speed of another volatile memory-SRAM, and the memory retention capabilities of non-volatile NAND? Semiconductor specialists refer to this as ‘Universal Memory’, and MRAM’s value proposition comes from its ability to harness the unique capabilities of some of the important memory sub-categories. Put simply, you’re looking at a tech that marries the performance of memory with the staying power of storage.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189784207728_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1034\" data-height=\"570\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189784207728_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MRAM Value proposition\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"353\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189784207728_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189784207728_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189784207728_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189784207728_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>January 2026 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This seemingly all-in-one facet of MRAM’s technology, enables it to thrive an flourish in a wide array of critical applications that could be subject to high radiation, high temperature</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>What Is The Next Catalyst For MRAM Stock?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most immediate major catalyst that I see for MRAM is its Q4 and FY results, that will be released on the<a href=\"https://investor.everspin.com/news-releases/news-release-details/everspin-announces-date-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\"> 4th of March</a>.

The chart below suggests that MRAM’s revenue growth trajectory tends to move around in cycles (the peak can get to sturdy levels of 80%, while it can also plummet to -40% during down cycles), and we are currently somewhere in the middle.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018970047151_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"647\" data-height=\"438\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018970047151_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Revenue growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"433\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018970047151_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018970047151_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018970047151_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018970047151_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCharts</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having said that, we believe that MRAM is on a long-term journey of reducing lumpy and volatile licensing and royalty fees (which is what mainly causes the spikes and troughs in revenue growth) to that of more consistent “product sales” oriented revenue profile (as of 9M-25<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/29677481\"> 86%</a> of MRAM’s revenue came product sales, and long-term management implied they want to get it to 90% or<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4838875-everspin-technologies-inc-mram-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\"> just 10%</a> from nonproduct sales).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because of the gradual shift towards product sales, investors should not be too upset to see MRAM’s gross margin profile continue to trend lower in Q4 and FY25 as a whole. For context, between FY21 and FY24, the gross margin profile contracted by over 800bps, and even as of 9M-25 there was further contraction (to the 51.3%). Investors should also keep in mind that relatively new additions (<a href=\"https://investor.everspin.com/news-releases/news-release-details/everspin-expands-high-reliability-mram-portfolio-new-automotive\" rel=\"nofollow\">EM064LX HR and EM128LX HR</a>) to MRAM’s PERSYST EMxxLX family would likely have seen a production ramp up in Q4-25 (ramp up costs of new products typically start at lower initial yields)</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189706396449.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Gross margins\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"481\" height=\"289\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189706396449.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189706396449.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-17720189706396449.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Prepared by the writer using data from the Jan 2026 presentation and 10Q</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market will also be looking to see if MRAM can continue to enhance its collection efficiency on its receivables' portfolio, which would reflect well on the quality of the cash flow that this business is generating. By quality of cash flow, I mean to say that during 9M-24 note that cash generated from receivables was quite minimal at $0.147M, with the adding back of SBC (Stock-based compensation) serving as the overwhelming source of operating cash flows. However, as of 9M-25, SBC expenses were trending lower by 14% at $4.4M and only accounted for 60% of the operating cash flow. A good chunk of the structural cash flow is coming from superior receivable collections, which stood at over $3M!</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018979555366_origin.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"668\" data-height=\"709\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018979555366_origin.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Cash flow statement\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"679\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018979555366_origin.jpeg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018979555366_origin.jpeg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018979555366_origin.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/9658941-1772018979555366_origin.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

Despite the uneven markets, Insteel may be in an appealing position for growth as<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> it develops relationships with engineering, procurement, and construction firms developing these large-scale facilities, potentially leading to recurring business over the coming years.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to this, management is reinvesting in operations to optimize production while lowering the cost to produce. Given the strengthening market dynamics, I am upgrading IIIN shares from <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4762965-insteel-industries-may-benefit-from-section-232-tariffs\">my previous \"Buy\" rating</a> to a \"Strong Buy\" rating with a price target of $46/share at 8.63x eFY27 EV/aEBITDA.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insteel Industries Operational Update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insteel’s q1’26 results were underpinned by strong selling prices and volumes offsetting input costs for materials like steel wire rods and scrap steel moving out of inventory, leading to the sequential compression of the gross margin. With steel shipments growing by 3.8% when compared to the previous year, pricing for Insteel’s concrete-enforced products likely drove the 23% year-over-year revenue in q1’26. Accordingly, average selling prices increased by 18.8%, driven by strong demand in the commercial and infrastructure markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Though the construction industry is presenting uneven growth dynamics, particularly for residential construction, the industrial data center market remains robust, providing a unique opportunity for Insteel to partner with engineering, procurement, and construction firms for materials sourcing. <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/the-data-center-balance-how-us-states-can-navigate-the-opportunities-and-challenges\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/the-data-center-balance-how-us-states-can-navigate-the-opportunities-and-challenges\" target=\"_blank\">According to McKinsey</a>, roughly $300<span> billion</span> will be invested for site construction [inclusive of mechanical, electrical, and plumbing] from 2025-2030, creating a massive opportunity for durable growth over the coming years. In addition to constructing the facilities, service roads and supporting infrastructure will need to be constructed, potentially providing additional materials that Insteels can supply. In addition to this, the regionality could potentially drive residential developments to support data center operations, particularly given that sites are being considered in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872782-texas-pacific-land-pivots-towards-long-term-data-center-strategy\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872782-texas-pacific-land-pivots-towards-long-term-data-center-strategy\" target=\"_blank\">West Texas in the Midland Basin</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the broad opportunities at hand, Insteel may be limited for growth given domestic production constraints for wire rod following two plant closures in the US. Accordingly, <a href=\"https://www.steelorbis.com/steel-news/latest-news/nucor-to-suspend-wire-rod-production-at-connecticut-plant-amid-challenging-market-conditions-1373645.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.steelorbis.com/steel-news/latest-news/nucor-to-suspend-wire-rod-production-at-connecticut-plant-amid-challenging-market-conditions-1373645.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Nucor</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NUE\" title=\"Nucor Corporation\">NUE</a>) and <a href=\"https://www.steelorbis.com/steel-news/latest-news/liberty-steel-wire-and-rod-plant-seen-restarting-in-march-pending-financial-arrangements-1366109.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.steelorbis.com/steel-news/latest-news/liberty-steel-wire-and-rod-plant-seen-restarting-in-march-pending-financial-arrangements-1366109.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Liberty Steel</a> each idled wire rod rolling mills in the U<span>nited States</span> as a result of challenging economics for the steel products, reducing domestic production by 800,000 tons per year, creating a wider dispersion between demand and domestic supply. This has largely pushed Insteel to augment capacity by importing wire rod, impacting gross margins due to the higher costs to import. Accordingly, this will likely continue through the remainder of eFY26, particularly given the strengthening industrial construction market environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another factor that may impact Insteel’s market is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4858860-exxon-mobil-2030-plan-more-robust-than-initial-forecast\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4858860-exxon-mobil-2030-plan-more-robust-than-initial-forecast\" target=\"_blank\">Exxon Mobil’s</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>) entrance into the building materials industry with Proxxima, a corrosion-resistant, carbon-based material designed as an alternative to rebar. <a href=\"https://www.proxxima.com/en/markets/infrastructure\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.proxxima.com/en/markets/infrastructure\" target=\"_blank\">Accordingly, Proxxima</a> is 75% lighter than steel and can be installed 40% faster than steel rebar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Section 232 tariffs imposed in 2025 have resulted in mixed economic factors that have impacted Insteel in recent quarters. From a pricing perspective for PC strand, steel product import restrictions have resulted in stronger pricing power for Insteel, allowing the company to realize substantial price increases for its steel products. On the other hand, import restrictions have impacted material costs for domestically produced wire rod, negatively affecting Insteel’s margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Relating to steel tariffs, <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/trump-plans-to-roll-back-some-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminum-goods-ft-reports/ar-AA1WiY5Y?ocid=BingNewsSerp\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/trump-plans-to-roll-back-some-tariffs-on-steel-and-aluminum-goods-ft-reports/ar-AA1WiY5Y?ocid=BingNewsSerp\" target=\"_blank\">President Trump</a> has been hinting at the possibility of rolling back certain steel product import tariffs to ease consumer inflationary pressures. This could potentially impact Insteel’s PC strand used in slab-on-grade construction for housing units, though which steel products the president is considering isn’t fully known.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insteel Industries Financial Position</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-17720348959605935_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"283\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-17720348959605935_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Corporate Filings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"186\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-17720348959605935_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-17720348959605935_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-17720348959605935_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-17720348959605935_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Corporate Filings</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead to eq2’26, I’m forecasting Insteel to generate $189.6 million in net revenue with a diluted EPS of $0.71/share. My forecast considers pricing dynamics for steel imports and improving operating leverage along with acquisition-related costs rolling off. Overall, I believe the market Insteel participates in is supportive of volume and pricing growth for eFY26, potentially driving another year of strong revenue generation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insteel closed q1’26 with 109 days of inventory on hand, up from 90 days in the prior quarter as a result of higher-cost materials going into inventory. Higher materials costs may have been, in part, impacted by tariff costs on steel product imports, which still remain at 50%. Accordingly, Insteel purchased offshore wire rod in the quarter to offset limited domestic supply.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result of the necessary steel imports, Insteel may experience relatively elevated inventory levels until the domestic market normalizes, which may not occur in eFY26. This may result in higher input costs for the time being, given the high import tax, shipment costs, and bulk materials imported to facilitate PC production.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insteel closed q1’26 with $15.6 million in cash &amp; equivalents and no debt on the balance sheet; Insteel has $100 million in available liquidity through its revolving credit facility, providing the firm substantial flexibility to continue to grow through acquisition and reinvestment going forward. As part of Insteel’s capital allocation plan for eFY26, the firm will be investing in its plants to support yields for engineered structural mesh with the intent of reducing production costs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks Related to Insteel Industries</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bull Case</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Large-scale data center developments may drive multiple verticals for growth, including facility construction, service roads, and potentially surrounding-area residential developments in desolate regions. Despite input cost pressures, Insteel has been successful in dynamically increasing prices for PC strand, offsetting margin risk. Reinvested capital in production may improve operating leverage over time.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bear Case</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Input costs may lead to choppy inventory management and margins for the coming quarters. Exxon’s entrance into the building materials market could potentially impact Insteel’s market long-term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation &amp; Shareholder Value</h2> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-1772034904366721_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"975\" data-height=\"176\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-1772034904366721_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Corporate Filings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"116\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-1772034904366721_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-1772034904366721_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-1772034904366721_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/16009792-1772034904366721_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Corporate Filings</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IIIN shares are currently trading at an appealing valuation at 8.49x EV/aEBITDA, creating an appealing buying opportunity for investors seeking to enter into a position.

The markets are full of stories about companies pivoting from<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a cyclical narrative to an AI narrative and since my </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846470-cipher-the-silent-winner-of-ai-infra\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">last coverage</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> CIFR is up 21% validating my pivot thesis. Therefore, CIFR remains a strong buy and can easily rerate as hyperscale lease cash flows replace mining volatility.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">From Bitcoin Cycles to Billion-Dollar Contracts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cipher Digital is no longer a bitcoin mining company. It has made a definitive pivot into a long-duration hyperscale-backed HPC infrastructure platform. The numbers associated with this pivot have now been achieved. The interesting thing about this time is not the narrative progression. It is the visibility of contract economics, capital structure engineering, and scale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the heart of this pivot is the <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/797/122797/original.pdf\">300 MW</a> hyperscale facility leased to Amazon Web Services with a 15-year contract with options. The economics associated with this contract alone have $5.5 billion in expected contracted revenue with Amazon’s guarantee of base rent and operating expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The economics also have a 100% NOI margin associated with the project level. That means revenue can be immediately turned into operating income before corporate overhead. This is a very different model from the mining business. The contract economics start October 2026. That means the inflection in the business will be seen in the next reporting cycles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Barber Lake adds another 300 MW of contracted HPC capacity. The combination of Black Pearl and Barber Lake adds 600 MW of HPC capacity versus 207 MW of bitcoin mining capacity. Pro forma, 74% of operating and contracted gross capacity is now HPC. Only 26% is associated with the mining business. The progression of revenue mix is already seen in the capacity allocation.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720079881109366_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2174\" data-height=\"1242\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720079881109366_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CIFR\" width=\"640\" height=\"366\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720079881109366_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720079881109366_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720079881109366_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720079881109366_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Business Update</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capital Structure: Aggressive But Structured for Scale</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, Cipher’s capital structure is consistent with a thoughtfully designed infrastructure build model.

The acquisition of the 200 MW site in Ohio's Ulysses area via Ulysses further broadens geographical risk profile beyond Texas.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071763331897_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1165\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071763331897_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CIFR\" width=\"640\" height=\"364\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071763331897_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071763331897_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071763331897_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071763331897_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Business Update</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Construction &amp; Execution Risk: Barber Lake Is On Schedule</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key risk in this valuation thesis is execution risk. The good news is that the construction of the Barber Lake site is reportedly on track. Concrete foundations, steel erection, and underground work are all progressing. All design milestones have been achieved thus far in line with schedule.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874069-cipher-mining-inc-cifr-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">secured 95%</a> of long-lead-time equipment necessary for the project which helps remove supply-chain risk. The more important figure is that 100% of workforce requirements for the duration of the project have been secured. In an infrastructure play like this, workforce risk is often the biggest risk to execution. That risk seems to be removed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is reportedly on track to achieve contractual early access and substantial completion milestones. As lease payments do not begin until October 2026, timeline risk is an integral component of this valuation thesis. Construction photos suggest that the project is making material progress rather than just laying groundwork for the facility. That is visible infrastructure being assembled rather than concept drawings. If timelines are adhered to, then the revenue inflection window is now deterministic.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071768905864_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1151\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071768905864_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CIFR\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071768905864_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071768905864_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071768905864_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-17720071768905864_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Business Update</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Black Pearl Economics: Long-Duration Cash Flow Engine</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Black Pearl lease agreement with AWS is a very strong structure. The 15-year lease agreement has 3 options to extend the lease by an additional 5 years. This equates to a 30-year potential revenue visibility. AWS will guarantee the fixed rent as well as operational expense reimbursement. This is a very strong structure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At 300 MW gross capacity and $5.5 billion in contracted revenue, this asset alone will reshape the earnings profile of Cipher. Assuming steady-state conversion at levels in-line with the project expectations, the internal return profile will have a very different look and feel from a bitcoin mining profile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is the inflection point. Once the Black Pearl asset is fully paying the rent, the perception will shift from a crypto-adjacent company to a hyperscale company. This will drive multiple re-rating opportunities.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-1772007966812225_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2170\" data-height=\"1230\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-1772007966812225_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CIFR\" width=\"640\" height=\"363\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-1772007966812225_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-1772007966812225_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-1772007966812225_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49853134-1772007966812225_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Business Update</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation: Paying Up for the Growth Curve</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently trading at $17, CIFR is paying up for a hyper-growth infrastructure company. CIFR has a trailing sales multiple of about 27x and a forward sales multiple of about 24x, while sector medians are closer to 3x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While these multiples appear rich on an initial glance, consensus revenue growth estimates are expected to turn sharply from 2026’s run-rate of about $228 million to nearly $1 billion in 2027 and $3 billion in 2029. As such, the current premium rapidly compresses based on expected hyperscale scale rather than current mining industry revenue.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_90209b8b82e2b0b50c58592fee2a8526.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_90209b8b82e2b0b50c58592fee2a8526.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_90209b8b82e2b0b50c58592fee2a8526.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_90209b8b82e2b0b50c58592fee2a8526.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The One Risk That Truly Matters: Execution Timing</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The one critial risk I see to the investment thesis is the execution timing for Black Pearl and Barber Lake projects. Everything in this valuation hinges on these projects substantially completing and energizing within a specific timeframe. Lease payments are based on these delivery milestones. If energization is delayed by a few quarters, the entire revenue inflection, the entire leverage situation, and the entire market narrative will change in a hurry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is a large-scale data center build and these types of projects are not without variables outside their control, including approvals for interconnection with the electric grid, transformer deliveries, contractor sequencing, and local regulatory approvals. Even with 95% of long-lead equipment deliveries and their workforce locked in, infrastructure projects are not always linear.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Structural failure is highly unlikely but even minor slippages will put pressure on the shares due to the premium valuation. Timing is everything.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is not a speculative mining play trying to understand how to play the adjacency to AI. They have hyperscale leases and they have structured them. They have a multi-year NOI growth story that fundamentally changes their nature as a public entity.</p>",
