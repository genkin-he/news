Eight months later, shares are up about 35%, more than double that of the broader market. The stock jumped ~20% alone on the recent Q4 beat and raise, with 2026<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> guidance coming in 13% above Wall Street’s consensus. Pricing power, operating leverage, and international growth were all contributors.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">LMAT has been one of the top performers in my own portfolio over this period. Is it time to trim? Is there still near-term upside for those looking to add shares?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having digested the 2025 results, my short answer is that the business has earned its high valuation multiples. A key catalyst is Artegraft – the international rollout is changing the math. But a more important takeaway is that LMAT’s overall earnings power appears to have stepped higher. This is structural rather than cyclical.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 and Full-Year 2025: Another Clean Sheet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"mailto:https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20414156-lemaitre-q4-2025-financial-results\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"mailto:https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20414156-lemaitre-q4-2025-financial-results\" target=\"_blank\">latest quarterly report</a> exceeded expectations in almost every way. Sales were up 16% YoY with organic growth at 15%. All segments gained, led by grafts (27%), valvulotomes (20%), and carotid shunts (18%). Growth was also broad-based geographically, with EMEA up 29%, APAC 20%, and the Americas 10%. Profitability metrics were also outstanding across the board. Organic growth in Q4 broke down to about 9% price and 6% unit growth, meaning the recent margin expansion isn’t just due to volume.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Most important is that this has been a pattern. For several years LMAT has been growing sales by double digits while managing gross margins of 60-70%.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58879822-1772216013010596_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1432\" data-height=\"427\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58879822-1772216013010596_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bar graph showing gross profit growth for LMAT over the past decade.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"191\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58879822-1772216013010596_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58879822-1772216013010596_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58879822-1772216013010596_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58879822-1772216013010596_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha (LMAT Financials - Gross Profit)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The FY 2025 results included beats on revenue and EPS. The $2.91 (midpoint) guidance for 2026 represents an 11.5% increase.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Artegraft Surprise</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For me, the most important news in this report wasn’t the headline figures. It was buried <a href=\"mailto:https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875065-lemaitre-vascular-inc-lmat-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"mailto:https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875065-lemaitre-vascular-inc-lmat-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">in the earnings call Q&amp;A</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management said the addressable market for Artegraft outside the U.S. may be much larger than previously understood. LMAT originally sold Artegraft in the U.S. for dialysis access procedures. The procedure is handled differently in Europe: patients skip the implanted graft step entirely and go straight to catheters. That creates an opportunity to develop new demand rather than simply substitute for existing procedures. As adoption has progressed, Artegraft is also being used in leg bypass procedures in addition to dialysis access.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a profitability standpoint, this fits well with LMAT’s “mix shift” toward biologic implants, which now account for more than half of total sales. These products tend to have higher average selling prices and attractive margins. As a result, Artegraft should disproportionately help earnings growth even if the impact on the top line is modest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2025 international sales of Artegraft came in at $4M versus guidance of $2M, and that’s expected to grow to $10M in 2026. Approvals are in place for 52 countries, with traction gaining in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. The U.K. and parts of southern Europe are just getting started.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, this product is performing much better than management previously modeled. The markets are larger than anticipated, and there appears to be a long runway ahead. It’s a meaningful development for long-term LMAT investors and one I’ll watch closely this year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance Sheet and Capital Allocation for LMAT</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">LMAT ended 2025 with a net cash position of about $190M, accounting for its $168M in convertible notes. This is a significant war chest for a company with a ~$2.5B market cap. M&amp;A, as always, is on the table for LMAT. Management has identified a number of potential targets in both vascular and cardiac surgery.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The board approved a <a href=\"mailto:https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557368-lemaitre-vascular-raises-dividend-by-25-to-025\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"mailto:https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557368-lemaitre-vascular-raises-dividend-by-25-to-025\" target=\"_blank\">25% dividend increase</a> for Q1 2026, making it fifteen consecutive years of increases. A new $100M share repurchase authorization was also approved. Neither makes LMAT an “income” play, but they do add to total return.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58879822-1772216013065088_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1431\" data-height=\"355\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58879822-1772216013065088_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Table showing dividend data for LeMaitre Vascular\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"159\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58879822-1772216013065088_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58879822-1772216013065088_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58879822-1772216013065088_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58879822-1772216013065088_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha (February 27, 2026)</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">LMAT: Valuation and Updated Price Target</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here’s the tension: the stock has appreciated by ~35% since last summer, and Wall Street’s consensus price target shows no near-term upside. The market appears to have priced in a lot of good news.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My preferred method of assessing valuation is to compare companies to their recent historical averages. Given LMAT’s niche direct-to-hospital model and biologics-heavy mix, its own history is more informative than comparing it to the much larger, diversified medtech conglomerates. (Broad sector comparisons are even less helpful – particularly in Health Care where the business models of insurers, drug makers, and equipment manufacturers are vastly different.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By those measures, LMAT is trading in line <a href=\"mailto:https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMAT/valuation/metrics\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"mailto:https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LMAT/valuation/metrics\" target=\"_blank\">with its own norms</a>: slightly lower in P/E, about even in EV/EBITDA, and slightly higher in EV/sales.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58879822-17722160132261205_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1431\" data-height=\"552\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58879822-17722160132261205_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Table comparing current valuation data for LMAT against historical averages.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"247\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58879822-17722160132261205_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58879822-17722160132261205_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58879822-17722160132261205_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/58879822-17722160132261205_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha (data compiled by the author on February 27, 2026)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming the current P/E of 40x holds for the next couple of years, we’re looking at price targets of roughly $116 for 2026, $124 for 2027, and $134 for 2028. This is a CAGR of ~7.5%, or just over 8% annually including the dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I find this conservative given the growth rates outlined above, particularly with the potential bottom-line impact of Artegraft adoption in Europe.

The intrinsic value is moving higher, and its operating leverage is among the industry leaders. But clearly for new investors, the entry point is less attractive than it was this time last year (based on what we knew then). The premium relative to peers like Boston Scientific (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BSX\" title=\"Boston Scientific Corporation\">BSX</a>), Stryker (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SYK\" title=\"Stryker Corporation\">SYK</a>), and Medtronic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDT\" title=\"Medtronic plc\">MDT</a>) stands out, though I believe it’s justified given LMAT’s niche focus. A pullback below $100 would improve the overall risk-reward dynamic.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line: Buy Rating Reiterated</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">LeMaitre Vascular is doing what it’s been doing for years: growing sales while maintaining pricing power and expanding internationally. The Artegraft surprise is the latest reason to believe earnings have room to grow beyond the base case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m raising my price target for year-end 2026 to $116-$130 based on a forward PE of 40-45x. I maintain a <em>Buy</em> rating for long-term investors. The potential upside (at present) may be less attractive than a year ago, but LMAT remains an excellent candidate for a dividend growth portfolio. The main questions remain: (1) Can LMAT continue to raise prices without softening demand? (2) Can management sustain gross margins in the low-70% range? (3) Can the company continue expanding its direct sales model internationally given the upfront costs and regulatory challenges?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On all three counts, 2025 was certainly encouraging.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Author’s Note: This analysis reflects data and information available as of February 27, 2026.</p>",

Firstly, for the top line, Dell reported $33.4 billion in revenues, up 39% YoY. This is a clear improvement from the <a href=\"https://investors.delltechnologies.com/static-files/76df3c58-df57-458a-b91c-3869487a92a2\" rel=\"nofollow\">previous quarter's growth rate</a> of just 11%, and so there has been a very meaningful pickup in business momentum overall. We'll go into more depth for their two segments later, but it should be noted that both Infrastructure Solutions Group and Client Solutions Group saw acceleration, and so there has been broad improvement in the company's trajectory. Lastly, note that Dell <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DELL/earnings\">posted a monster beat</a> of top line expectations as they surpassed estimates by $1.75 billion as a statement of outperformance in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://investors.delltechnologies.com/static-files/433e7b1b-c749-4411-bcd7-2f23fbf7f112\" rel=\"nofollow\">Above, you can see that</a> non-GAAP operating income grew slower than the top line as a signal of margin weakness. If you go and take a look at their Q4 earnings release, you'll see that adjusted gross margin dropped by nearly 4 percentage points. This could be a signal of consumers choosing lower margin products or higher costs affecting their Client Solutions Group and AI-server commoditization headwinds in their Infrastructure Solutions Group. In both segments, operating income growth underperformed revenue increases. While this is unfavorable, Dell did control their operating expenses well. Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue dropped by 3.2 percentage points as a sign of good efficiency, but the adjusted operating margin still dipped due to the gross margin weakness.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the end of the day, Dell actually still managed a strong bottom line growth rate. For adjusted EPS, they reported $3.89, representing a 45% increase YoY. This also beat expectations, as they surpassed consensus estimates by $0.38. Also, note that there has been a considerable speedup of growth from 20% back in Q3. In FY2026, the company did a total of $6.014 billion in share repurchases, and so that definitely played a part in boosting the EPS figure. Investors should be encouraged by the amount of capital returns they are seeing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For Q4 specifically, stock buybacks are up from $734 million to $1.847 billion YoY, and so the company is sharing their strong cash flows with shareholders. As a whole, I consider Dell's company-wide financial performance to be robust even if gross margin was a sore point.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Infrastructure Solutions Group</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722096913620455_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"827\" data-height=\"509\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722096913620455_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ISG\" width=\"640\" height=\"394\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"394\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722096913620455_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722096913620455_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722096913620455_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722096913620455_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Dell Q4 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For their all-important ISG, Dell saw explosive revenue growth of 73% YoY, and you can see that this is a major acceleration of growth. This signals strong AI tailwinds and robust business momentum, but as mentioned earlier, margin is under a bit of pressure, and that could be a result of AI-server commoditization risks. Investors should definitely monitor margin for ISG moving forward, as contraction could take a major bite out of their profitability. Note that while revenue growth is far stronger than in the year ago quarter, operating income growth is actually slower, and at the end of the day, profits matter more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-1772210093129191.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ISG Metrics\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"612\" height=\"351\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-1772210093129191.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-1772210093129191.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-1772210093129191.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Dell Q4 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For demand, there are really no signs of a slowdown at this point. Some worry that CAPEX will drop, but in the most recent earnings season, it seems hyperscalers are actually deciding to spend more. As you can see above, orders exploded and are up by ~1900% YoY. Furthermore, you can see that their backlog is now $43 billion after a ~950% increase YoY. These are truly eye-popping numbers and provide key reassurance that demand remains through the roof right now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Client Solutions Group</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722104439629803_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"802\" data-height=\"513\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722104439629803_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CSG\" width=\"640\" height=\"409\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"409\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722104439629803_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722104439629803_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722104439629803_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722104439629803_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Dell Q4 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For their CSG business, growth also accelerated from Q3 to 14%. As you can see above, commercial activity seems to be strengthening, and consumer activity looks like it is stabilizing at this point. Margin performance for the past few quarters has been unfavorable, and Q4 was no exception. As mentioned earlier, this could be a sign that clients are choosing lower margin products as overall spending remains weak in the U.S. and in other key markets around the world. This could also be a reflection of the memory shortage causing higher costs for Dell.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just today (Feb. 27th), Preeti Singh of Seeking Alpha <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558735-tech-firms-margins-under-pressure-from-rising-memory-costs\">came out with a piece</a> that described memory-related margin pressure for tech firms. Furthermore, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558694-pc-smartphone-market-to-see-a-challenging-2026-amid-memory-shortage-rising-prices\">it was reported that</a>, according to research firm IDC, 2026 will be a \"challenging year\" for PCs and smartphones due to the memory shortages. We'll take a look at their guidance next to see what Dell thinks about these risks, but I would say there are definitely some potential headwinds for CSG.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook Is Respectable</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722110403933597_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1364\" data-height=\"558\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722110403933597_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Guidance\" width=\"640\" height=\"262\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"262\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722110403933597_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722110403933597_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722110403933597_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722110403933597_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Dell Q4 Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dell provided both quarterly and annual guidance. We'll focus on the full year numbers for a better long term view of where things are headed. Firstly, for revenue, they see ~23% of growth YoY. This bests FY2026's 19% top line growth rate, and so business activity is set to continue accelerating moving forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">You can see in their key assumptions that ISG is expected to see growth in the mid-40s, while CSG is expected to see growth of just 1% YoY. This would be acceleration for the former but deceleration for the latter, and so it does seem that the memory shortage could be a significant factor moving forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dell expects their expense control to remain solid as non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to grow in just the low single digits. This is very strong efficiency, given that the revenue growth rate will be above 20%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, for adjusted EPS, they see growth of ~25%. While this is a modest slowdown from FY2026, note that it still outpaces the expected top line growth rate for FY2027 as an indication of respectable profitability moving forward. As a whole, I consider their annual outlook to be solid and note that they <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558194-earnings-snapshot-dell-guides-fq1-fy27-comfortable-above-estimates-after-solid-quarterly-print\">guided far above consensus</a> for both the top and bottom line.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Gets Even Cheaper</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722116131040013_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"887\" data-height=\"820\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722116131040013_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"592\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"592\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722116131040013_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722116131040013_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722116131040013_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/57947294-17722116131040013_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my previous article, I stated that their valuation was very cheap. That was when the forward P/E ratio was at a reading of 12.16. As you can see <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DELL/valuation/metrics\">in the table above</a>, this multiple has further retreated to a current level of just 10.57. In my view, this shows that Dell stock is very attractively valued. You can also see above that Dell is trading at levels far below the IT sector median for nearly all multiples, and so I would say the market isn't giving them enough credit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Firstly, Dell's fundamentals aren't perfect. Margin weakness in ISG hints at commoditization risks, while the memory shortage is a potentially significant headwind for CSG moving forward. Despite these challenges, there is no denying that AI demand is more than robust and that their growth is overall accelerating. Business activity is strong, and the company's good control of operating expenses is helping to offset gross margin weakness. Therefore, as a whole, Dell remains in a solid position moving into FY2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, the valuation multiples above show that the stock is undervalued relative to the company's fundamentals and prospects, and so the risk/reward remains very attractive at current levels.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As stated in the intro, I expressed my view that Dell was approaching bargain territory in my previous article. After today's analysis and review of their Q4 earnings results, I believe the stock is now deep in bargain territory. Sure, there were weak points and risks pointed out in this article, but at this valuation, the market is underpricing and underappreciating what the company brings to the table. AI demand is as solid as ever, and the financials are in good shape overall. With Dell now even cheaper than in my previous article, according to the forward P/E ratio, I have decided to upgrade the stock to a Strong Buy rating.</p>",

(0:25) Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce and AI moats (2:30) Week's biggest movers (8:00) Netflix bows out; Paramount and Warner Bros closer to deal (10:20)</p> <p>Transcript</p> <p><strong>Rena Sherbill: </strong>Our last Wall Street roundup of February. Welcome back, Brian Stewart, Seeking Alpha's Director of News.</p> <p><strong>Brian Stewart:</strong> Great to be here.</p> <p><strong>Rena Sherbill: </strong>Talk to us, what are you looking at these days?</p> <p><strong>Brian Stewart:</strong> I think we have to start with Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>). The stock dropped about 5% yesterday after its earnings report. It was up initially in the post market, but then eventually ended the next day lower. Beat expectations, gave better expected guidance. On the surface, everything seemed fine.</p> <p>I think in terms of explaining why it's down, I think I would point listeners to a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872493-this-is-a-stock-pickers-market\">conversation</a> that you had last week on Investing Experts.</p> <p>There was a good discussion about whether Nvidia might be kind of in a trap of its own making where even good results are never going to be good enough because there's just sort of this built in expectation that Nvidia is going to blow us away every time they report results.</p> <p>So I think it's really a sell on the news kind of situation. The stock was up six out of the seven days going into earnings. So there was this building anticipation for it. I think everybody thought results were fine, better than fine.</p> <p>But the narrative about the build out for AI infrastructure remains in place. There's no end in sight to the amount of money that these companies seem willing to spend in terms of buying chips. think really from a video's point of view, it's almost like a supply problem.</p> <p>I think filling all the demand that's out there is probably getting a little difficult. But when you look at the broader market, the stock has been in a range pretty much this entire year since November, really. So you're just having trouble for Nvidia, for investors to see the next step for Nvidia.</p> <p>And creates a situation where there's sort of this worry that the other shoe is going to drop eventually. Like if they ever kind of have a bummer quarter, you know, the stock might feel it pretty sharply.</p> <p><strong>Rena Sherbill: </strong>We'll leave a link to that Investing Experts episode. There's actually a couple in the past week that we discussed that conundrum of Nvidia. I'm going to leave a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874186-why-daily-stock-picks-gary-vaughan-likes-large-cap-tech-and-energy\">link</a> to both. What else are you looking at stock wise?</p> <p><strong>Brian Stewart:</strong> Yeah, I think a lot of headlines this this week kind of played into the the conversations surrounding AI, like all the different facets of it. The market was kind of dinged after the Nvidia earnings, the sort of overall response to it.</p> <p>But it wasn't anything major. I think of it as like a jump scare in a horror movie. Most of the time when there's a jump scare, it's one of the cats jumping out in front of you. The worry is that eventually one day it'll be a monster in the closet that jumps out. So I just think that the market is on edge.</p> <p>As we integrate the AI revolution into our conceptions of what the economy looks like, it's just gonna be a long-term process and there's really no way to sort of game it out in any sort of way where you could be confident about your model of what's gonna happen is correct.</p> <p>Just some examples, (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\" title=\"International Business Machines Corporation\">IBM</a>) was down 13 % on Monday. Biggest drop for the company since 2000. it's not about 20 % in the past month. So it was already showing some weakness before, it was dropped. The catalyst for that was Anthropic saying that Claude can improve COBOL, which is IBM's proprietary programming language. The response to that from IBM and from defenders is, it's one thing to kind of be able to emulate these proprietary languages and quite another to use them in the way that they're designed to be used.</p> <p>There's just several more steps of it. I saw Dan Ives have a comment about the fears around software and AI kind of taking over the software space. And he basically said that even if you can replicate the software, you still don't have the corporate shell around it.</p> <p>You take a company like Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) and Word and Excel and things like that, you can get free or cheap spreadsheet software elsewhere. You can get free or cheap word processing software elsewhere, but the connections that Microsoft has, the reach it has, the brand it has makes it more valuable. Unless everybody's just gonna vibe code their own spreadsheet software, there's still a market for Excel.</p> <p>And I think that's true. If you think about, you could go to the store and buy your generic, my grocery store is Wegman. So you can get like W Cola or whatever it's called. But people still want Coke, you know? And so I think that that's a pretty good argument for some of these larger companies.</p> <p>The moat might be different than what people are imagining that moat to be. But it doesn't speak well for smaller companies that don't have that sort of brand identity and don't have that reach. You might have sort of big monoliths at the sort of top of the market. And then like a lot of little fish kind of swimming around elsewhere. And again, that's something that the economy in general is going to work out over the next few years.</p> <p>And then on that same topic, we had Salesforce (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRM\" title=\"Salesforce, Inc.\">CRM</a>) report its earnings this week. It was up about 4 % after reporting earnings. It's still down 27 % yield year to date. So you're basically seeing kind of a relief rally. Things aren't as bad as we had feared. It actually pretty solid earnings report.</p> <p>Salesforce is a company that's become one of the names that people point to for the idea that eventually AI is going to kind of get rid of all these software companies. And I think there's sort of a feeling in the market that that might've been overdone, that we've probably kind of taken that a little too far.</p> <p><strong>Rena Sherbill: </strong>To your point about Microsoft and Excel and its prevalence in the marketplace, I was listening this morning to a couple stories about how in Europe, I believe France recently in some, I don't know if it's national or regional, the government agencies in some districts are stepping away from Teams and Zoom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZM\" title=\"Zoom Communications, Inc.\">ZM</a>).</p> <p>Other places in Europe are stepping away from using Microsoft and getting out of the dependence on US big tech. Have you heard any stories like this?</p> <p><strong>Brian Stewart:</strong> Well, the one thing would point out is Zoom was down very sharply after its earnings. I was kind of looking at it in the same frame as, you know, if we're if a lot of this software is going to become sort of generic sized, you know, whatever. mean, you can get a lot of video conferencing software that isn't Zoom and, you know, places like Google Meet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>), like a lot of a lot of these bigger companies have these items built into it. Not really having much of opinion on the kind of politics of it, the regional aspect of whether people are choosing against America elsewhere. But I do think there are a lot of choices, like a lot of the stuff nobody really cares. Like the Coke, generic Coke kind of controversy, those at least taste different. But I don't know that I would notice if I was using a non zoom zoom like product.</p> <p>So I do think that there are challenges for these companies to build that brand, to build that understanding, to have features that are unique to it, something proprietary, something they can point to that, can kind of prevent what you're discussing is, you have this glut of choice. Whatever reason you might have, whether you don't like the country that the company's based in, if it's too expensive, whatever issue is sort of driving you to look for alternatives, I think there's a lot of alternatives.</p> <p><strong>Rena Sherbill: </strong>Yes, we saw a couple names jump this week, sort of significantly, Circle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRCL\" title=\"Circle Internet Group, Inc.\">CRCL</a>) being one of them fairly significantly, post earnings, (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XYZ\" title=\"Block, Inc.\">XYZ</a>) announced layoff situations. Would you point to those as two of the bigger movers this week?</p> <p><strong>Brian Stewart:</strong> Yeah, Circle jumped 35 % after its earnings. I think, again, like kind of taking it as like another aspect of sort of the overall AI conversation. The Coinbase (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COIN\" title=\"Coinbase Global, Inc.\">COIN</a>) CEO had said, I think it was last week after their results that he sees stable coins becoming kind of the central default currency choice for AI agents that was played out a little bit in circles earnings just in the fact that they're stable coin, like the adoption was like strong growth in that area.</p> <p>So I do think that a lot of that upswing wasn't really a response to the earnings per se, which were strong, but not really 35 % increase in stock price strong. But I think it's more just sort of a bet that as we become more reliance on AI agents, you know, like if we're going to have an AI agent that, you know, pays my mortgage, so I don't have to remember it or whatever.</p> <p>It might become, stable coins that become the currency kind of moving back and forth instead of having my AI agent being able to log into my bank account, which seems really dangerous. But there's a pool of stable coins that I have that it can use to do those transactions for me.</p> <p>So I think there's a vision of the future where everyone's always pointed to crypto, this digital currency will be breaking down barriers and providing a less frictionless or more frictionless commerce situation. And for a long time, it's been sort of argued that Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD\" title=\"Bitcoin USD\">BTC-USD</a>) would be the eventual winner in that.</p> <p>And I think there's a feeling like stable coin is another contender for that category that that might become a default, like actual currency, like a currency that we use. So it doesn't replace the fiat currency, but just kind of becomes a way to facilitate transactions digitally.</p> <p><strong>Rena Sherbill: </strong>And filing this one also under the theme of as the world turns the news out of the movie streaming future of movie conversation with the Paramount (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PSKY\" title=\"Paramount Skydance Corporation\">PSKY</a>) Netflix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX\" title=\"Netflix, Inc.\">NFLX</a>), Warner Brothers (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WBD\" title=\"Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc.\">WBD</a>) conversation partnership. Netflix has bowed out.</p> <p>It's still not a done deal. I would also point to another Investing Experts <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855483-there-is-no-streaming-war\">conversation I </a>had a couple months ago with Dan Rayburn, who is truly a capital E expert on the space and talking about there is really nothing to talk about until the deal is signed. There's a lot of succession like plot points afoot, I think. But it does seem like Paramount is going to get that deal barring regulation interference.</p> <p>Anything to add there?</p> <p><strong>Brian Stewart:</strong> Yeah, I do think in a way it's better as kind of theater than, the business aspect of it. I have to admit that I've kind of a romantic notion of Warner Brothers, like going back to AOL and even before that.</p> <p><strong>Rena Sherbill: </strong>I don't think you're alone. I think there's a lot of romanticism around that name.</p> <p><strong>Brian Stewart:</strong> Yeah, it just like it keeps getting packed like there's been 100 deals. I mean, I'm exaggerating, but there's there's been it feels like every couple of years, there's a deal with Warner Brothers where it's moving to a new asset. So I just look forward to 2035 when it's open, I Warner Brothers and, you know, like Bugs Bunny is doing my taxes for me or whatever.</p> <p><strong>Rena Sherbill: </strong>And Rita Hayworth is walking down a hologram red carpet and we're back to the old glamour.</p> <p><strong>Brian Stewart:</strong> Yeah, that sounds great. Like you could cast like literally anybody in the history of movies into your movie. It's like if Katherine Hepburn is perfect for this role, let's just cast her. I mean, I think that kind of goes back to what we were talking about, about like the Coke, generic Coke kind of situation with AI. I mean, there'll be a time in the not too distant future where I could make a movie with starring Tom Cruise and Rita Hayworth or whoever.</p> <p>But can I get that in theaters? I mean, obviously there's copyright issues or whatever, but I'm just saying there are value to having the distribution and you know the know how and all the things that go into just being a movie studio versus you know, like if you shoot it on your iPhone because you know the story of the last. I don't know 40 years is it's gets kind of cheaper and cheaper to to make a movie. You know you and your friends can use your iPhone and make a movie that looks pretty close to a movie you know which wasn't that.</p> <p>That wasn't really possible in like, say, 1965 or whatever. Meanwhile, the movies produced by studios get more and more expensive because they're leaning more on the IP and stars and just, you you really have to get attention.</p> <p>So I think like that kind of points where we're talking about the. You know, a world where there's there's a few giant companies in any given space, but then you have a lot of kind of smaller startup situations going on.</p> <p>And then just to go back, like you had mentioned Block (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XYZ\" title=\"Block, Inc.\">XYZ</a>), which we didn't talk about too much, but I do think it's one of the more interesting stories of the week.</p> <p>So they had earnings, which were fine, but then they announced a 40 % job cut. I think it's important to note that 40 % is a lot, that's not like a normal corporate, like we're kind of moving deck chairs around, like when a one drug development company misses a primary endpoint on a clinical trial and then they announced they're cutting 40%.</p> <p>But the company made clear that they're doing this because they think AI they're for do as intelligence tools, but I think we're talking AI makes all their workers so much more productive that they really don't need these extra workers. So I think that they're trying to show like that we're a healthy company. We have revenue growth, we have profitability, but we also see a future where we just don't need as many people to do what we want to do. And I think that plays out.</p> <p>One of the interesting aspects of it is the severance packages that they announced were really generous. So it was 20 weeks plus one week per year of tenure, six months of healthcare. The laid off employees get to keep their corporate devices and they also get sort of a $5,000 just bonus to spend as they see fit during their job search. And I don't want to disparage the humanity of the management there. I'm sure that they wanted people to have a smooth transition just because that's the right thing to do.</p> <p>I think from a corporate point of view, you're trying to discover a business reason for giving such generous severance, I think it's to signal to the market that this isn't a panic move.</p> <p>I think it points to the broader social conversation that we're going to have in the future. If AI does make work so efficient that suddenly we have this sort of structurally higher unemployment just because we don't need as many workers. And I'm talking white collar workers, than we once needed, and whether or not that's going to point to a situation where we're to have to have a kind of a different sort of social policy surrounding that.</p> <p>I think Block is sort of saying, if we're going to make these transitions, we have to think about what that means for the individuals involved and not just cut them loose.</p> <p><strong>Rena Sherbill: </strong>Anecdotally, I've also seen, I think it's important to point out that we are in the beginning slash midst of this AI changeover of society and how work exists and how it's performed. I've heard anecdotally from a number of people at a number of publicly traded companies and non-publicly traded companies that there were a lot of layoffs because AI has enabled that to happen, but then a lot of those, maybe not a lot, but a good portion of those people have been rehired because management realized there might be some efficiencies, but they don't work out because they don't exactly equal one whole person's, you know, acumen and life experience and ability to really trouble, all the things that we know that humans are capable of.</p> <p>AI can't solve for all of that, like the business will suffer without long-term corporate know-how and all the things that humans provide. So I think there is genuine fear and also genuine planning for this change for obvious reasons. But I think also we are still in the TBD phase of this. We don't really know how this is. It's certainly significantly going to change things. But I think long-term, we're still not sure, I would say.</p> <p><strong>Brian Stewart:</strong> Yeah, well, I mean, you make a good point because the other side of the argument, I don't know if you call it like the libertarian side or whatever, would be that the the increase in productivity makes every employee more profitable, you know, because you get more out of them.</p> <p>So you actually want more employees because each employee becomes that much more of a profit generator as long as you can kind of usefully employ them. I think that's another model that's possible. And I think that's an argument that people would make is okay. You might see a blip of this layoff round. But as AI works its way through the population, you're just going to get a situation where you're going to need more people.</p> <p>And that's been the argument in going from sort of a manufacturing economy in sort of pre-1970s kind of timeframe to a more service economy. And the argument is that the economy always kind of finds a place for people to be useful. We went from working in factories to coding and now we're going to go from coding to, you know, prompt writing or however you want to envision the future. So I do think you're right. There's a bunch of different possibilities as we sort of branch off into the next time.</p> <p><strong>Rena Sherbill: </strong>And there is always a chasm between the promise of a thing and the delivery of a thing. So a lot to keep in mind as the days and years unfold. What are you looking at earnings wise in the coming week?</p> <p><strong>Brian Stewart:</strong> So not lot of major headliners. You have some retailers coming next week. You got Macy's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/M\" title=\"Macy's, Inc.\">M</a>), got Best Buy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BBY\" title=\"Best Buy Co., Inc.\">BBY</a>), American Eagle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AEO\" title=\"American Eagle Outfitters, Inc.\">AEO</a>). You also have a few tech players.</p> <p>Alibaba (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA\" title=\"Alibaba Group Holding Limited\">BABA</a>) is the kind of highlight there, also Broadcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>). So I don't think there's gonna be anything market moving in terms of the S&amp;P (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" class=\"ticker-link\">SP500</a>) or the NASDAQ (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NDAQ\" title=\"Nasdaq, Inc.\">NDAQ</a>) or whatever, but within particular sectors and particular companies we are gonna get some information.</p> <p>And then along with the conversation that we've been having, the jobs data is due out next week as well. So we're gonna get an update on the macro impact of, like you said, a bunch of these companies deciding whether or not they need as many employees as they used to think they did.</p><div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder\"></div><p>Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NXRT\" title=\"NexPoint Residential Trust, Inc.\">NXRT</a></span>) would finally stage a turnaround in 2026. Alas, despite a notable decline in 10-year U.S. treasury<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> yields (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y\" class=\"ticker-link paywall-full-content\">US10Y</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) to around 4% and solid performance for the broad Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund ETF (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VNQ\" title=\"Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund ETF\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">VNQ</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), NXRT is down in the mid-single-digits year-to-date.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the company's 2026 outlook reflects continued operating performance pressure and well-known refinancing headwinds, I think that the shares may finally catch a bid later this year, thus upgrading the rating to Strong Buy. My bullish outlook is underpinned by:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>An undemanding 11.2x 2026 Core FFO multiple, notwithstanding the company's high leverage.</li> <li>An attractive 6.7% market-implied cap rate, notably above management estimates used to calculate a midpoint net asset value of $48.57/share.</li> <li>The potential for near-term catalysts such as asset sales and Fed rate cuts in H2 2026.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Readers not familiar with NXRT may find the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4847005-nexpoint-residential-trust-risks-tilted-to-upside-heading-into-2026\"><em>Company Overview</em> section in my previous article insightful</a>. The only major change I would highlight is that NXRT acquired a Las Vegas property for $73 million in December 2025, bringing its enterprise value to $2.3 billion as of February 2026, 68% of which is funded with net debt.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 2025 Results Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://s26.q4cdn.com/937656400/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/NXRT-Q4-2025-Earnings-Release-FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">NXRT reported Core FFO of $0.65/share</a> in the final quarter of 2025, down 4.4% Y/Y. The decline was principally driven by a 4.8% drop in same-store net operating income [NOI], only partially offset by a 2.9% reduction in shares outstanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The decline in NOI came as NXRT ended 2025 with an occupancy of 92.7%, 2% lower Y/Y, with the company seeing rents largely flat Y/Y at $1,489/unit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Relative to Q3 2025, we observe that NOI dynamics deteriorated notably (NXRT had recorded NOI growth of 3.5% relative to Q3 2024), with occupancy slipping 0.9% Q/Q as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, it is fair to say NXRT ended a challenging 2025 on a weak footing, although share repurchases and stronger performance early in the year helped the company deliver full-year 2025 Core FFO of $2.79/share, flat relative to 2024.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2026 Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The weak year-end performance is reflected in the company's 2026 Core FFO outlook of about $2.57/share (range of $2.42-2.71), implying a drop of roughly 7.9% Y/Y. The principal driver behind the decrease will be higher interest costs, while NOI is seen at about $155 million, only down 0.5% on a same-store basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874043-nexpoint-residential-trust-inc-nxrt-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">discussed on the conference call</a>, NXRT's average cost of debt stood at 3.28% at year-end 2025, below recent financing achieved at a spread of 1.23% relative to the 30-day average secured overnight financing rate [SOFR]. With Fed funds futures <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">pricing in</a> a Fed funds rate of about 3% by the end of 2026, we see that the company's marginal financing cost should be slightly above 4% at the end of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To sum up, NXRT's 2026 outlook principally reflects the gradual expiration of favorable interest rate swaps (an effect that will likely continue to weigh on Core FFO in 2027) as well as some incremental decline in net operating income.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation and Rating</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NXRT trades at only 11.2x its Core FFO outlook for 2026. I think this low multiple is principally the result of the REIT's high leverage (68% net debt relative to enterprise value), as well as continued pressure on Core FFO from a challenging operating environment and higher financing costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In light of the REIT's high indebtedness, looking at enterprise-level valuation metrics, such as the market-implied cap rate, may provide a clearer picture. This is especially true in light of ongoing refinancing at higher rates, the impact of which partially depends on the speed of future Fed rate cuts (hence is somewhat difficult to estimate). As a reminder, enterprise-level valuations are agnostic between cash flows to shareholders and debt holders, making them particularly useful in NXRT's case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NXRT expects 2026 NOI of about $155 million, or a market-implied cap rate of 6.7% relative to the $2.3 billion enterprise value. While the anticipated 0.5% NOI decline in 2026 naturally puts near-term pressure on total return prospects, over the medium to long term, I anticipate NOI growth to return to a level close to the 2% inflation rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 6.7% is also notably above the 5.25-5.75% cap rate range used by the company to estimate a <a href=\"https://s26.q4cdn.com/937656400/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/NXRT-Esupp-Q4-25-FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">net asset value</a> [NAV] of $48.57/share, reflecting a range of $41.43-55.72/share depending on the cap rate used.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of the time of writing, NXRT trades marginally below $29/share, reflecting significant double-digit upside to net asset value estimates. Investors will pay close attention to potential disposals later in 2026, as their cap rates may either confirm management cap rate assumptions or, alternatively, make them seem too optimistic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To conclude, taking account of my expectations for a gradual improvement in operating performance in 2027, fading refinancing headwinds thanks to anticipated Fed rate cuts (a trough in Core FFO will likely be reached in 2027), and attractive enterprise-level valuation, I now believe that a Strong Buy rating is warranted for NXRT, up from my previous Buy rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Near-term catalysts may include asset sales close to management estimates of net asset value, as well as the first rate cut for 2026, which markets price in for June/July 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In light of NXRT's elevated leverage, a slower-than-expected pace of Fed rate cuts will likely put further pressure on refinancing costs in 2026-2027. As such, even if operating performance does improve next year, a further reduction in Core FFO cannot be ruled out and, in fact, is quite likely in my opinion, since swap expirations are tilted toward H2 2026 (principally in September 2026).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second key risk to consider is that operating performance fails to pick up in 2027, contrary to the optimism voiced by chief investment officer Matthew McGraner on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874043-nexpoint-residential-trust-inc-nxrt-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">conference call</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>After absorbing the largest supply of wave since the 1980s, completions -- with completions peaking at almost 700,000 units in 2024, a 54% increase from 2021 baseline completions, we are optimistic that new lease growth is set to turn positive across most Sun Belt markets than the second half of this year with sharp acceleration into 2027. Reasons for our belief include persistent structural demand. The cost to own a home is 3x more to rent an apartment in our markets. A 60% decline in new market rate deliveries from the peak and construction starts running approximately 70% below their 2022 peak, locking in a multiyear supply trough. Weighting each NXRT market by unit exposure, the portfolio level to jobs new construction unit ratio bottomed at approximately 1.5 jobs to one unit of new delivery in mid-2025 and our entire portfolio is projected to cross back above the historically significant ratio of 4 jobs to one unit by Q1 of 2027.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A prolonged period of lackluster NOI growth, with or without refinancing headwinds, will likely result in NXRT stock continuing to trade at a high market-implied cap rate, thus dashing hopes for a quick turnaround in the share price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For NXRT, 2026 is starting in the same way 2025 ended, with the REIT's shares significantly underperforming the broader VNQ ETF. While the company's outlook principally reflects refinancing headwinds that were known in advance, expectations for a further NOI decline in 2026 are weighing on the shares, with the REIT now trading at a market-implied cap rate of 6.7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect operating performance to pick up in 2027, which coupled with a resumption in Fed rate cuts in 2026 should allow NXRT stock to rerate higher. Asset sales close to management estimates of net asset value may prove to be a catalyst for the shares, although we have no indication of a pending sale at the moment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NXRT's high leverage is a key risk in the investment case. Furthermore, a slower pace of operational improvement may further weigh on Core FFO in 2027, which I expect to decline relative to 2026 due to the full-year effect of 2026 swap expirations.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thank you for reading.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRI\" title=\"Carter's, Inc.\">CRI</a></span>) reported <a href=\"https://ir.carters.com/news-releases/news-release-details/carters-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q4 '25 results</a>, with positive top-line dynamics, growing via higher pricing and traffic, but negative bottom-line dynamics, posting worse gross (tariff) and operating (marketing) margins.</p> <p>The company also provided fairly<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> challenging guidance for FY26, expecting again to grow (mainly via pricing) but also to close stores, lose gross margins to tariffs, and potentially maintain operating income. Net income will suffer because of more expensive financing.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When we consider next year's guidance, the company is trading at a P/E of 10x forward. For a clearly challenged name, with no signs of cyclical improvement and very negative secular trends (drop in fertility), I continue to believe the name is not attractively priced and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833768-carters-top-line-resists-at-the-expense-of-margins-not-worth-15x-earnings\">maintain</a> a Hold rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 '25 Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Carter's results were not well received by the market, with the name falling as much as 20% intraday after the release.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Part of the reason is probably the 2026 guidance (more on this later), but also the lack of results in Q4 '25. The dynamics in Q4 '25 are also repeating into 2026. We could summarize the situation as ok in the top line, bad in the bottom line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Starting with the top line, the reported figure was good because the company grew revenues by ~7.5% (U.S. retail almost 9.5%, wholesale 3.3%, and international 10%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, under the hood, revenues still show weakness. First, like with many retailers in Q4, Carter had an extra week compared to last year, which added $37 million in sales out of the $66 million increase (<a href=\"https://ir.carters.com/static-files/765784b7-911a-45b4-bd2a-5b1c777ba303\" rel=\"nofollow\">earnings presentation</a> by segment). That means the comparable figure fell to $29 million, or ~3.3%. Then, we need to add that in both US retail and wholesale, the company is starting to add pricing because it needs to pass on the higher costs of tariffs. If costs go up by 5% and the company passes a 5% price increase, then even if sales are up 5%, no new units were sold, and gross profits are flat. Finally, in the International segment, the USD has depreciated against other currencies (mainly MXN and CAD), resulting in FX-driven growth in USD-denominated revenues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving to the bottom line is where the real challenges in the top line continue to show. When adjusting for an impairment last year, the company's adjusted operating margin fell 370 bps. The majority of this fall is attributed to gross margins (460 bps YoY), a mix of tariff impact that has not been passed down to customers, and a policy of lower pricing aggressiveness because of the cyclical position of the market.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2026 Comments</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The guidance for 2026 is very similar to the results from 2025. That is, the company expects to grow the top line, but that is not going to translate into more profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Carter's is expecting to grow LSD to MSD next year, with U.S. retail growing LSD (MSD after accounting for the closure of stores), whereas wholesale and international grow MSD. A big part of this is pricing, as commented on in the company's <a href=\"https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/n3gtzup9/\" rel=\"nofollow\">earnings call</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company did not provide specific guidance for gross margins but expected SG&amp;A to be flat in dollar terms and operating income to grow LSD/MSD. This implies that gross margin should be approximately flat. However, this is hard to square with tariffs. The company commented during the call that the impact of tariffs will be between $200 million and $250 million in FY26 (gross, that is, before pricing action), but that it was only $60 million in FY25. A $225 million gross impact on revenues of about $2.8/2.9 billion implies a pre-pricing impact to gross margins of at least 7/8 percentage points.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Indeed, Q1 works as an example, with sales expected to be up HSD, but operating income expected to be down more than 60%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To the operating line impact, we have to add the refinancing of fixed-rate bonds in late 2025, which will add $40 million in interest. This will result in EPS down 10/15% for the year (or guided to around $3.25).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering the guidance above and that the stock was trading at around $32/34 on the day of the earnings release, it is basically trading at around 10x FY26 guided earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As commented in previous posts, Carter's looks very cheap when looking back (the company made close to $8 in EPS during the post-pandemic), but looking ahead, not so much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not only is the company showing pricing power challenges (otherwise it should be able to pass down tariff costs), but it also faces an outlook of <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-birth-rate-all-time-low-cdc-data/\" rel=\"nofollow\">lower fertility</a> in the US and in North America that will have a clear impact on its market in less than 2 years from now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the company continues to represent a \"value trap,\" a name that is optically cheap but with a worsening business (at least for now) where a low multiple gets higher not because P grows, but because E decreases.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the time being, I still consider CRI as not opportunistic but will continue to follow the story with interest. I maintain a Hold.</p>",

Now, the first thing to know about ETJ is that it's certainly not a bull market fund, but unlike inverse ETFs, ETJ will go UP in a bull market, though it will not capture 100% of the upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But that's why I say you have to look at ETJ as more of a high-yield bond fund without the risk of holding high-yield bonds in a bear market. What do I mean by that?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you go back to 2008 during the last financial crisis, heavily leveraged fixed-income CEFs fell anywhere from <em>-30%</em> to <em>-40%</em>, just as much as equity CEFs. So don't think being in fixed-income bond funds during a bear stock market will save you.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But there was one fund back in 2008 that owned nothing but stocks and actually gained <em>+6.3%</em> vs. <em>-36.8%</em> for the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>), <em>$689.30 current market price</em>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And that CEF was ETJ:</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_68aff3a655a29991c38a36e5ab484943.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_68aff3a655a29991c38a36e5ab484943.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_68aff3a655a29991c38a36e5ab484943.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_68aff3a655a29991c38a36e5ab484943.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So how did ETJ do it? Well, market prices in CEFs are established by shareholders buying and selling, so a CEF's market price can actually go much higher or much lower than its NAV. And in volatile markets, you can often see CEFs make dramatic moves at market price even if their NAVs aren't moving much at all.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And that's what you can get in ETJ. I have no control over ETJ's market price, which is currently at a <em>-7.5%</em> discount to its NAV. But I do know that once the S&amp;P 500 falls <em>-3%</em> or more, ETJ's put options will start to kick in and provide NAV support.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like most of the Eaton Vance option income CEFs, ETJ owns a technology-heavy S&amp;P 500 benchmark portfolio that has the typical top 10 holdings and sectors that look like this:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722022851855159_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1058\" data-height=\"516\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722022851855159_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"ETJ's top holdings and Sectors\" width=\"640\" height=\"312\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"312\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722022851855159_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722022851855159_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722022851855159_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722022851855159_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Eaton Vance</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But when you look at ETJ's option sleeves as of Dec. 31, 2025, it becomes very clear why Eaton Vance includes<span class=\"highlighted_text\"> \"<em>risk managed\" </em>in</span> ETJ's title.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here's a snapshot of ETJ's put and call options as of 12/31/2025:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722024982166865_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"772\" data-height=\"662\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722024982166865_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"ETJ's option sleeves as of 12/31/25\" width=\"640\" height=\"549\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"549\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722024982166865_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722024982166865_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722024982166865_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/799235-17722024982166865_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Eaton Vance</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What you see in the notional amounts above is what each option tranche actually protects in ETJ. The written call valuations are what the fund would keep if the tranche expired worthless, whereas the put options will go up in value as the S&amp;P 500 goes down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So if ETJ is a <em>$638 million</em> fund and if you add up the notional values of the written call options and long put options, they each add up to roughly <em>96%</em> of ETJ's total assets managed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's extremely defensive, especially when the put options go in the money.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The final key to understanding ETJ's option sleeves is that its written call options are put on every few business days at <em>+2.1%</em><span class=\"highlighted_text\"> out of the money, while its put options are slightly more out of the money at <em>+3.1%</em>.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What that means is that ETJ takes in income from selling call options and turns around and buys put options, which are less expensive because they're more out of the money.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And because ETJ puts on new option tranches every few days (unlike most option ETFs that use monthly expirations), the fund is always prepared for a sharp drop.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It may take a <em>-3%</em> drop in the S&amp;P 500 for ETJ's latest tranche of puts to go in the money, but the more the S&amp;P 500 drops after that, the more of ETJ's put tranches will go in the money too.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And this is why ETJ's NAV will not move much once its put options kick in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, ETJ's market price can be a lot more volatile than its NAV, but if you're looking for a fund that will eventually hold up in a bear market while paying an <em>+8.9%</em> market yield (annualized) while you wait, then ETJ should be in your portfolio and should be considered more of a safe income fund than an appreciation fund.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, ETJ is a bit different today than what it was back in 2008. Today, ETJ has more of a growth stock tilt in its portfolio (see top 10 holdings above) than what it had in 2008, which was more overweighted in value stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That's because Eaton Vance did want to give ETJ better appreciation potential by including more Nasdaq 100 stocks, even though it uses the S&amp;P 500 as its benchmark and for its options.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recently, though, the Nasdaq 100 has <em>not</em> been outperforming the S&amp;P 500, so that's been a bit of a negative factor for ETJ. But ETJ is still a very forgiving fund at NAV (not necessarily at market price), and even if its portfolio is underperforming the S&amp;P 500, it should be able to deliver a reliable and sustainable high single-digit return, whether it's from its yield, from its appreciation, or a combination of the two.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And that might look awfully good in case of a bear market!</p>",

Double-digit growth in revenue and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> cash collections were both positive, as was a year-over-year improvement in cash efficiency, but significant performance gaps remain, and management must find ways to improve key yield metrics to drive a sustained recovery in the share price.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of Friday morning, PRA Group shares are down about 7% since my last update, with a major post-earnings move helping counter a steep decline in late January. Rival Encore Capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ECPG\" title=\"Encore Capital Group, Inc.\">ECPG</a>) has done considerably better over that period, and the discrepancy between these two companies across multiple metrics remains stark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bull argument for PRA Group remains that there is a pool of assets here that can be managed better and generate substantially higher financial returns, and when those improvements come through, they should drive a substantial rerating. The main bearish counterpoint remains the fact that it really is not a “when” and is very much an “if”—there are no guarantees that the new CEO and the latest operational restructuring will meaningfully close what has been a growing operational gap with Encore over several years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>A Stronger Fourth Quarter Helps The Turnaround Thesis</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ll go into the drivers of PRA Group’s current predicament a little later, but suffice it for now to say that the issues here cannot and will not be fixed in a matter of quarters. Even so, good results are good results, and <a href=\"https://ir.pragroup.com/2026-02-26-PRA-Group-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results\" rel=\"nofollow\">fourth-quarter</a> performance should improve sentiment and confidence around the near-term trajectory of the business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue rose about 15% this quarter, beating expectations by about 13%. Portfolio income (the more reliable revenue driver and the one more tied to core operating performance) rose more than 14%, while expected recoveries rose 16%, helped by 14% growth in excess recoveries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash collections grew almost 14% as reported, or about 10% in constant currency. U.S. Core collections rose 19%, while bankruptcy collections were down 7%; the latter can be volatile from quarter to quarter. Core European collections were up 8% in constant currency, while bankruptcy collections were down 23%. Collections from other markets (Brazil, Australia, et al.) were flat in constant currency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Core operating expenses were up only about 4%, helping drive 80bp year-over-year improvement in the cash efficiency ratio to 61.4%. Operating income rose 33%, and PRA Group reported a very large EPS beat relative to sell-side expectations ($1.46 vs. $0.50).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio purchases were down 27% yoy and up 23% qoq, with core US purchases down 37% yoy. Estimated remaining collections were up 15% yoy and almost 3% qoq (to $8.61B), while average receivables rose about 13% yoy and 1% qoq.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>A Lot Of Work Remains</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fourth quarter was inarguably better than expected, but a look at Encore’s <a href=\"https://encorecapital.gcs-web.com/static-files/e02cfdf1-86f8-4d9c-bfde-7218f8dbd9c3\" rel=\"nofollow\">fourth-quarter</a> performance underscores that there is still a major performance gap here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Encore saw similar year-over-year growth in ERC (up 14%) on lower receivables growth (up 2%), and portfolio revenue rose about 13% on 21% growth in cash collections. Purchases were down 34% yoy, and the amounts purchased by each company were broadly similar ($315M for PRAA and $327M for Encore). Cash efficiency at Encore improved significantly year over year to 57.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Where the gaps are really noticeable is in their respective collections and portfolio yields. PRA Group improved its collection yield (cash collections divided by average receivables) by 30bp yoy to 45.9%, while Encore’s rose 280bp to 62%. Portfolio yield (portfolio revenue divided by receivables) improved 30bp to 22.7% at PRA Group and declined 80bp to 35.1% at Encore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe these gaps go a long way toward explaining the divergent performances at the two companies and why/how PRA Group has struggled to regain any real traction in earnings growth or market sentiment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are multiple potential drivers of different yields, including PRA’s larger European business, but the reality is that Encore is better at analyzing charged-off paper for collectability (and paying appropriate amounts) and then also better at collecting on those debts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the two companies do not provide readily comparable data about their portfolios, both buy a lot of credit card debt, including substantial amounts where there have been prior collection attempts. To that end, then, I don’t think there are material ongoing differences in the portfolios that explain the difference (I don’t believe PRA necessarily buys riskier paper and takes a “win big/lose big” approach, for instance). I believe Encore is simply better at modeling expected recoveries and/or takes a more conservative approach with those models.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I also believe that Encore out-executes in the collections process, including payer segmentation, collector productivity, and collections strategy. PRA Group management has talked recently about making better use of technology, and this could certainly help collections yield through automation, analytics, payer engagement, and settlement strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps counterintuitively, PRA Group’s cost efficiency may actually be a bit of an issue—I don’t have the data to assert this as fact, but Encore may be making better use of legal collections channels (which are more expensive), simply operating with more collections activity intensity, and/or offering more settlements to enhance recoveries. Clearly something is working better for Encore, as they are trouncing PRA Group in portfolio and collections yields despite a less efficient cash cost structure.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Outlook</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the above in mind, the fact that PRA Group has offshored about a third of their U.S. collections activity and cut 115 corporate/overhead positions (for an estimated $20M/year in savings) is nice, but not necessarily going to solve any of the real issues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Put simply, perhaps too simply, PRA Group has to improve its pre-buy analysis of charged-off paper and make sure they’re more accurately modeling collections and paying appropriate prices. They also have to improve their collections efficiency; while there are enough differences in the two companies’ portfolios that the yields may never match (some paper will simply take longer to collect on, for instance), the numbers suggest that PRA simply isn’t managing the collections process as effectively as it needs to—and that’s down to hiring the right people (and keeping them) and having the right technology to monitor and enhance the collections process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management explicitly mentioned that it was seeing the benefits of improved buying selectivity, and that suggests that recent acquisition vintages will perform better than has been the case in prior years. That’s a good foundation, but the company has to build on it. To that end, I’d note that management’s guidance for portfolio acquisitions in 2026 ($1B-$1.3B) doesn’t suggest much growth, so revenue growth will have to come from enhanced collections efficacy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If PRA Group is turning around, it will still take time for the benefits to show. There’s already evidence that recent acquisitions are performing better, but improved collections efficiency and fundamentally better acquisition strategies will take time to develop, mature, and show up in the numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe PRA Group could generate better than 20% earnings growth in 2026, and with a good supply of charged-off paper and operational improvements, I think double-digit growth is possible over the next five years, with longer-term core earnings growth in the high single digits. This, too, should support strong double-digit free cash flow growth that will help reduce leverage, continue to fund portfolio growth, and leave some room for further returns of capital to shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Between discounted cash flow and core earnings, I believe fair value is in the $20 to $22.50 range.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This company badly needs a steady period of improved execution, and it’s too soon to say if that’s going to happen. If PRA Group can improve its analytics and execution, there is substantial upside here, but that is the consummate “Spartan if.” Management is saying the right things, including embracing more technology in its purchasing and collections process to better leverage years of collected data, but investors have seen this before. The upside potential is meaningful if this is in fact a real turn in the business, but this is a name only suitable for investors who can tolerate high levels of operational/execution risk.</p>",

After a difficult 2024 and 2025 due to weak consumer confidence, elevated food inflation, and high interest rates, investors seemed to have largely given up on the sector as they saw the average consumer struggle. These reasons led to underperformance, which ultimately led to consistent guidance and estimate cuts and multiple compression. Management teams and analysts are tired of continuously reducing estimates and have set the bar very low. The setup now looks asymmetric—sector estimates and valuations imply continued stress for consumers, meaning we don’t need a massive recovery for stocks in the sector to perform well; we just need conditions to stop getting worse.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Background</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://www.sca.isr.umich.edu\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener\">University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index</a> ended the year in the low 60s, well below its long-term average near 80 and even below levels seen during the Global Financial Crisis. When sentiment is that depressed, expectations tend to skew heavily to the downside. This implies limited downside if things stay soft but meaningful upside if conditions stop getting worse / improve at the margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/1/61189130-17699679400792954_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"936\" data-height=\"524\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/1/61189130-17699679400792954_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Consumer Sentiment Index\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/1/61189130-17699679400792954_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/1/61189130-17699679400792954_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/1/61189130-17699679400792954_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/1/61189130-17699679400792954_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Survey of Consumers, University of Michigan.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After two years of cutting guidance and watching estimates move lower, expectations for 2026 are now extremely modest. According to Goldman Sachs (Consumer Staples 2026 Outlook published in January), staples earnings estimates were cut by roughly 5% over the course of 2025, driven by volume softness and elevated promotional activity. Management teams have responded by resetting the bar, aiming to avoid further guide-downs. The chart below shows how long growth expectations are for Staples vs. the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/61189130-17709501591855078_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"756\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/61189130-17709501591855078_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Consumer Staples expectations vs S&amp;P 500\" width=\"640\" height=\"381\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/61189130-17709501591855078_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/61189130-17709501591855078_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/61189130-17709501591855078_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/12/61189130-17709501591855078_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Wells Fargo 2026 Consumer Staples Outlook.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Catalysts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The first reason why I believe the consumer should stabilize in the near term is federal policies due to mid-term elections approaching. This means policymakers have an incentive to introduce policies to help the average consumer. A near-term example is tax refunds. According to Wells Fargo (<a href=\"https://wellsfargo.bluematrix.com/docs/html/ed999074-45da-4ba7-92df-9fd7b06e80a7.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tax Refund Season Report</a>), the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is expected to reduce household tax liabilities by roughly $150 billion in 2026, or about 0.5% of GDP. On average, this equals roughly $800–850 per tax filer, with a meaningful portion of those refunds arriving early in the year. Because lower- and middle-income households typically spend rather than save tax refunds, incremental income often flows into everyday categories such as groceries, beverages, and household essentials—areas where staples companies generate most revenue. Some examples would be perhaps you take your family out more than usual, or you host 1-2 more gatherings. Perhaps you go to more events / concerts / movies where you would spend money on some snacks and drinks. Consensus estimates for the year may account for some incremental impact from the consumer improving but still remain pessimistic, given analysts have had to cut numbers consistently for the last 2 years. This means consensus is likely not accounting for any secondhand impact from the OBBA, such as the examples discussed above.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second reason is the FIFA World Cup, which will be hosted in the US in the summer of 2026. The average consumer looks at such events as one-time opportunities and tends to participate even if that means spending a little more than initially planned. Major sporting events historically boost spending for packaged foods, beverages, beer, and snacks—core categories for consumer staples companies. This is a function of increased gatherings, watch parties, and increased tourism, which leads to incremental demand. Additionally, hosting the tournament should bring in international visitors, who tend to spend disproportionately on food and drinks. Importantly, as companies guide to 2026 and analysts set estimates for the full year, nobody is including any upside in their numbers. Beer companies (such as Constellation Brands (STZ)) in their calendar Q4 earnings have discussed a likely incremental impact from the FIFA World Cup but have not included it in their guidance because it is difficult to quantify.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The third reason is high incremental margins. Consumer staples businesses generally carry high fixed costs: manufacturing plants, distribution networks, and store footprints. The last few years have shown how meaningfully profits can shrink on relatively small drops in volume. The same math works in reverse, meaning as we see some incremental volume growth due to the reasons discussed above, the incremental growth in profit margins should be disproportionate.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Staples Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consumer staples’ forward PE ratio currently sits near the low end of its long-term range.

With policy support, modest event-driven demand, easing cost pressure, and valuations already reflecting pessimism, 2026 could turn out better than the market currently expects.</p>",

This was a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1250-bad-beat-investing/articles/5306339-what-is-going-on-with-my-silver-and-gold-mining-stocks\">long-term investing idea at BAD BEAT</a> Investing at a $1.35 basis. We have long<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> maintained a house position in this mid-tier silver name. Typically, we favor companies that can demonstrate organic growth without sacrificing the integrity of the balance sheet. For a long time this has been a challenge for the precious metal miners, we have to tell you. We saw stagnant prices outside of the slow grind higher in gold (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAUUSD:CUR\" title=\"Gold Spot Price\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">XAUUSD:CUR</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), silver (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XAGUSD:CUR\" title=\"Silver Spot Price\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">XAGUSD:CUR</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">), and base metals, with rising costs of production.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, folks, Endeavour Silver Corp. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXK\" title=\"Endeavour Silver Corp.\">EXK</a></span>) spent the last 24 months attempting to bridge the gap between being a high-cost legacy producer and a modern, multi-asset senior producer. Shares have absolutely skyrocketed on the back of the huge surge in metals prices. While the stock is expensive at first glance, when we consider. The <a href=\"https://edrsilver.com/site/assets/files/14787/edr_q4_2025_financial_results_tc_3_items.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">company’s Q4</a> and fiscal year 2025 results, released just this morning, confirm that the growth has arrived, but it has come with a hefty price tag.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, we are neutral on the name. We still hold it, and if prices stay elevated, it will translate to more earnings and justify the share price. Let us discuss.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Endeavour Silver Financial and Operating Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the market is cheering the 115% jump in revenue, we are taking a bit more measured approach as long-term shareholders. The transition from developer to a 15-million-ounce-equivalent producer is notoriously fraught with ramp-up costs and issues, and Endeavour’s Q4 numbers, in our opinion, certainly reflect a company that is currently larger, yet significantly more complex to manage. That all said, 2025 was, by any operational metric, a transformational period for Endeavour (and many other miners too). The company reported record revenue of $467.5 million, more than doubling the $217.6 million seen in 2024. This was driven by a 48% increase in silver equivalent (AgEq) production, which reached 11.2 million ounces.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Endeavour Silver Costs High, Earnings Light All Things Considered</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the bottom line tells a different story. Despite the massive run-up in prices, Endeavour still reported a net loss of $119.1 million for the year. Much of this, of course, was tied to $126.2 million in derivative revaluation losses and $14.5 million in finance charges related to debt restructuring. While these are largely non-cash or one-time items and get adjusted out, they do underscore the volatility inherent in Endeavour’s aggressive capital structure, so it was worth mentioning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, we mentioned costs above. That is more concerning. Specifically, it is the trend in All-In Sustaining Costs (AISC). For 2025, AISC landed at a staggering $31.52 per silver ounce, a 32% increase over the previous year. Even with realized silver prices averaging over $40/oz in 2025, the margin of safety is thinner than we would like to see for a company of this scale. Of course, silver is now much higher, but these are huge costs. Remarkably, the company only made $0.02 per share this quarter and lost $0.03 on the year. This again is all cost-related. Let's talk operations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Endeavour Silver Q4 2025 Operational Highlights</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The headline of Q4 in our mind was the successful declaration of commercial production at Terronera on October 1, 2025. In its first full quarter, the mine contributed 1.0 million AgEq ounces. While throughput was slightly ahead of schedule at 1,676 tpd, grades were lower than the life-of-mine average as the company focused on lower-grade zones during the initial ramp-up. We expect grades to normalize in the second half of 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At Guanaceví, the company’s bread-and-butter mine, for lack of a better analogy, recovered well from the 2024 trunnion failure, with throughput up 78% year-over-year. It remains the anchor of the portfolio, producing 3.9 million ounces of silver for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The newly acquired Kolpa mine in Peru is also beginning to contribute, adding significant base metal credits (lead and zinc) to the mix. However, the integration of a Peruvian asset into a historically Mexican-focused management team adds a layer of jurisdictional and operational risk that has yet to be fully de-risked. Meanwhile, the sale of the aging Bolañitos mine, expected to close this quarter, should help streamline management’s focus.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking Ahead on Endeavour Silver</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Endeavour’s 2026 guidance is ambitious, calling for 14.6 to 15.6 million AgEq ounces. This would represent another ~35% growth in output. One thing that we really like is that the company is trying to rein in its cost structure, guiding 2026 AISC down to the $27–$28 range. That would be welcomed. While this reduction is a step in the right direction, it still leaves Endeavour as one of the higher-cost producers in the silver sector. For comparison, peers with similar production profiles are targeting AISC in the low $20s. The capital-intensive nature of the Pitarrilla project and the ongoing inflationary pressures in Mexico suggest that meeting this $27 guidance is easier said than done.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Analyst <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXK/earnings/estimates\">consensus right</a> now is for $0.98 in adjusted EPS. That would mean just 14X roughly for what is some 6,000% growth. But the estimates are wide around this mark, ranging from $0.31 to $1.46. It will come down to those costs, and that is a big question mark. And should metal prices abate a bit more, the earnings power will be at the lower end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We do note that the company ended the year with a healthy <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EXK/balance-sheet\">cash position</a> of $215.4 million, bolstered by a $350 million convertible note offering in December. Liquidity is not the issue here right now. Efficiency is what 2026 will be all about. What we see here is that the company has successfully built out its growth potential, and at large costs. We do think that the start-up of Terronera and the acquisition of Kolpa have fundamentally changed the company’s production profile.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, until the company can demonstrate that this increased scale leads to meaningful, repeatable net earnings, and we get AISC down meaningfully (ideally under $25), we find it hard to issue a buy rating. As such, we are hold rated. If we get two or three clean quarters of commercial production from Terronera and a reduction in costs, we will reevaluate our rating.</p>",

That's not a typo. Block is going from 10,000+ employees to under 6,000.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The core thesis is simple. Intelligence tools have changed what it means to build and run a company. We're already seeing it internally. A significantly smaller team, using the tools we're building, can do more and do it better.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875898-block-inc-xyz-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Earnings Call</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI tools allow a smaller team to build more, faster. That much we have already learned from the SaaSpocalypse.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is responding to what it is seeing, which is:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>40%+ increase in code shipped per engineer</p></li> <li><p>Faster product velocity</p></li> <li><p>Leaner cost structure.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, Block has realized it can do the same with less, and that’s exactly what the company is doing, something the market has applauded.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you raise gross profit modestly but slash operating expenses, earnings explode. That’s exactly what the 2026 guide reflects: 54% Operating Income growth on 18% gross profit growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But underneath, this doesn't change the core issues that Block faces.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why I Would Sell</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This, in my view, is not how AI efficiency should work. I, in fact, discussed as much in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875518-did-nvidia-just-prove-citrini-wrong\">my recent rebuttal </a>of Citrini’s article.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI increases productivity. For companies that aren’t doing great, like Block, this is a lifeline that can help the company with a one-time productivity gain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the real winners of AI will be those who actually see the productivity gains and double down on them.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A growing company should see that engineers are 40% more efficient and hire more engineers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But that’s not the case with Square.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a company with single-digit gross profit growth and guidance and core products that have failed to differentiate themselves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">How is Cash App better than Venmo? How is Square better than any other PoS system?</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">We’ve Seen This Before</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50662133-17722088354400506_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1448\" data-height=\"1282\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50662133-17722088354400506_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"XYZ Valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"567\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50662133-17722088354400506_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50662133-17722088354400506_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50662133-17722088354400506_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50662133-17722088354400506_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">XYZ Valuation <span>(SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Okay, we’ll give it to the bulls. The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XYZ/valuation/metrics\">valuation</a> does look compelling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a forward PEG below one and a 10x Price/Fwd cash flow, this looks like a good buy here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But we’ve seen this story before.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The market doesn’t like to pay for companies that are in secular decline.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yes, I am once again using the PayPal (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PYPL\" title=\"PayPal Holdings, Inc.\">PYPL</a>) comparison, and I think it’s very apt when it comes to Block.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other Considerations (Risks)</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of that, there are many other risks to consider when it comes to this company. Competition is intense, and Square isn’t the only one gaining from AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, with 40% of the workforce gone, this now increases XYZ execution risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Square is going to look very different after this mass layoff, and the company must make the right choices in terms of who to keep.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, those who do stay have to have the motivation and incentive to try to keep this company going beyond 2026, and I don’t see a clear plan in place.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While it’s easy to get excited about AI efficiency, I think the market is misreading this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see a 40% layoff as a sign of weakness, and even if 2026 is a good year for Square, the future is not bright.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
