The market is expected to grow annually by 7.07% (CAGR 2025-2030).</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If this +7% CAGR forecast comes true, I think it could certainly be an upside factor for firms like this one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, when it comes to certain fruits like bananas, FDP fills a demand that simply cannot be produced in certain parts of the world due to unfavorable climate. For instance, SA analyst <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802637-fresh-del-monte-produce-stock-well-positioned-to-stay-fresh\">Waterside Insight</a> pointed out in their July article on this firm:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Almost 80% of its sales go to North America and Europe, where these fruits are not suitable to grow locally, except for the southern part of the US and Mexico.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, the laws of supply and demand impact this industry, as an oversupply of any fruit or vegetable could be a future downside for a company like this, whereas a shortage could work in its favor. Investors should consider that dynamic when considering this sector. For example, back in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/eat/humid-growing-conditions-lead-to-an-oversupply-of-bananas-priced-at-150kg/news-story/5f62bbf126f6433006fd125d3260cb73\" rel=\"nofollow\">Australian news</a> highlighted how past cyclones caused a banana shortage:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Most banana growers took a big hit and there was not much supply around, so the growers who did have supply, they made a lot of money.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FDP/growth\">forward revenue growth</a> for this firm is expected to be a mere +1.2%, 55% below its sector average, so that certainly could be a concern to investors putting more weight on the top line results:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58572054-17618156200444124_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"696\" data-height=\"106\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/58572054-17618156200444124_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"FDP -

It poses a threat to large commercial producers as well as small-scale local production.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe a mitigating factor that could favor FDP is that it not only is diversified across multiple products (not just bananas) but also uses multiple farms and supply-chain networks globally, so those could mitigate some of this risk, as opposed to a company with a single farm and product whose crop gets wiped out and it cannot sell it to the market.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, my call to action to readers, to conclude today's discussion, is to keep considering Fresh Del Monte if you want some portfolio exposure to this sector for the purpose of diversification, as well as a dividend income opportunity.</p>",

The company has one recently approved product, Palsonify, which is in the clinic pursuing a second indication, as well as another program addressing two other hormonal conditions. Crinetics was formed in 2008 and went public in 2018, raising net proceeds of $106.5 million at $17 per share. Its stock trades around $42.00 a share, translating to a market cap of just less $4 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s development approach is to target endocrine indications with low patient populations and high unmet need where the clinical trials employ biomarkers (such as hormone levels) as primary endpoints with proof-of-concept established by solid pharmacokinetics in healthy patients during Phase 1 studies. Each of these trial characteristics promote lower clinical expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Crinetics’ candidates are oral nonpeptide therapeutics that target peptide G protein-coupled receptors, which play a central role in the regulation of growth, energy, metabolism, GI function, stress, and nearly all aspects of homeostasis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Palsonify</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s commercial product is Palsonify (paltusotine), a once-daily small molecule somatostatin receptor type 2 (SST2) agonist that was approved by the FDA for the treatment of acromegaly when surgical response is inadequate or surgery is not an option on September 25, 2025. The green light was granted on the strength of two Phase 3 clinical trials. In PATHFNDER-1, 83% of acromegaly patients whose condition was controlled on peptide somatostatin mimickers octreotide or lanreotide depot monotherapy maintained insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels ≤ 1.0 times the upper limit of normal versus placebo (4%) (p&lt;0.0001). In PATHFNDR-2, the therapy achieved IGF-1 levels ≤ 1.0 times the upper limit of normal in 56% of treatment-naïve participants versus 5% for placebo (p&lt;0.0001).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/5.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1758850349\" alt=\"Acromegaly Symptoms Take a Toll on Patients\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/5.jpg?io=w1536&amp;ts=1758850349 1536w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/5.jpg?io=w1280&amp;ts=1758850349 1280w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/5.jpg?io=w1080&amp;ts=1758850349 1080w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/5.jpg?io=w750&amp;ts=1758850349 750w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/5.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1758850349 640w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/5.jpg?io=w480&amp;ts=1758850349 480w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/5.jpg?io=w320&amp;ts=1758850349 320w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/5.jpg?io=w240&amp;ts=1758850349 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>September 2026 Company Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In both studies, Palsonify maintained or lowered seven key symptoms of acromegaly, which is typically triggered by a benign pituitary tumor causing excess growth hormone [GH] discharge, resulting in the over secretion of IGF-1 by the liver. Since both GH and IGF-1 promote tissue development, their overproduction results in giantism-like abnormal growth of hands and feet and changes in facial features. In addition to these outward physical manifestations, acromegaly can cause arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, changes in glucose and lipid metabolism, fatigue, organ enlargement, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, skin odor, vision issues, and hypopituitarism. These symptoms contribute to increased mortality rates and lower quality of life.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/18.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1758850349\" alt=\"Acromegaly Patient Reach\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/18.jpg?io=w1536&amp;ts=1758850349 1536w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/18.jpg?io=w1280&amp;ts=1758850349 1280w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/18.jpg?io=w1080&amp;ts=1758850349 1080w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/18.jpg?io=w750&amp;ts=1758850349 750w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/18.jpg?io=w640&amp;ts=1758850349 640w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/18.jpg?io=w480&amp;ts=1758850349 480w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/18.jpg?io=w320&amp;ts=1758850349 320w, https://static1.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/804/114804/slides/18.jpg?io=w240&amp;ts=1758850349 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>September 2026 Company Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The first treatment option for the ~36,000 Americans suffering with acromegaly (of which ~17,000 are undiagnosed) is surgery, which can be curative if the tumor is accessible for complete resection. If surgery is unsuccessful, pharmacological options include first-line generic somatostatin analogs, including the aforementioned octreotide and lanreotide. However, the efficacy of these once-monthly, physician-administered (intramuscular or deep subcutaneous) peptide injections is spotty, with approximately half of the ~4,000 patients on these therapies failing to achieve biochemical control or experiencing a return of symptoms by month’s end. Pfizer’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>) Somavert (pegvisomant), a daily injectable GH receptor antagonist, is generally prescribed when these peptide therapies fail. An oral version of octreotide – Chiesi Farmaceutici’s twice-daily Mycappsa – was approved by the FDA in 2020 after 58% maintained their IGF-1 response versus 19% on placebo (p=0.008). However, its administration requires two fasting periods per day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With clear superiority to Mycappsa and a significantly greater delivery advantage over the peptide and GH injections, Palsonify should rapidly become the go to treatment option in an admittedly crowded space when surgery is inadequate. Management believes that in addition to the ~1,500 newly diagnosed domestic patients per annum, there are currently ~11,000 diagnosed patients with high unmet need. An awareness program targeting the ~17,000 undiagnosed sufferers is part of an October 2025 launch, supported by a sales force of 36 and an annual price of $290,000. The EMA is expected to render a decision on its use across the pond in 1H26. News of the FDA sanctioning shot shares of CRNX 28% higher to $45.91 in the subsequent trading session.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other indication being pursued by Crinetics’ approved therapy is carcinoid syndrome, an excessive secretion of serotonin that causes severe diarrhea and flushing that afflicts ~33,000 Americans. Caused by neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), the disorder, like acromegaly, is typically treated with injectable peptide somatostatin analogs. That said, in 2018, Novartis’ (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVS\" title=\"Novartis AG\">NVS</a>) Lutathera (lutetium Lu 177 dotatate), a radioligand (i.e., a drug that combines a therapeutic molecule with a radioactive particle) was approved by the FDA for the treatment of gastro-entero-pancreatic NETs after demonstrating a 79% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death versus standard of care in patients with unresectable NETs in the midgut region. Despite being administered through four IV injections over eight weeks and intramuscular injections every four weeks for 18 months, owing to the fact that its addressable domestic market is ~110,000 (out of a total NET population of ~175,000), Lutathera sales reached $724 million in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After reducing flushing frequency by 63% (n=24; p&lt;0.0001) and excess bowl movements by 60% (n=16; p=0.02) in a Phase 2 trial, Palsonify is expected to enroll its first participant in a 141-patient, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study (CAREFNDR) with the prior study datapoints comprising the primary and key secondary endpoints (respectively) in 2H25.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Atumelnant</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Crinetics other clinical asset is atumelnant, an oral nonpeptide adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) receptor agonist that is being investigated for the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia [CAH] and ACTH-dependent Cushing’s Syndrome (ADCS). CAH is a set of genetic maladies resulting from poor cortisol synthesis, which engenders over secretion of ACTH with multiple downstream effects such as overproduction of testosterone, leading to excessive facial hair, abnormal menstrual cycles, acne, and/or life-threatening salt and fluid imbalances. The conditions afflicts ~27,000 Americans, of which ~17,000 would likely be eligible for atumelnant. ADCS is the result of an overactive pituitary gland or ectopic (i.e., outside the pituitary) tumors that produce excessive levels of ACTH. With an estimated domestic prevalence of 11,000, Crinetics believes that ~5,000 would be eligible for atumelnant treatment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After demonstrating dose-dependent and statistically significant declines in morning serum androstenedione (A4) levels at week 12, atumelnant is set to be tested in three pivotal trials, including a Phase 2/3 study (BALANCE-CAH) in children and a Phase 3 trial (CALM-CAH) in adults – both with CAH – that should initiate in 2H25. A Phase 2/3 study for ADCS is expected to start in 1H26.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It should be noted that after seven decades without a new treatment option, <strong>Neurocrine Biosciences (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NBIX\" title=\"Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc.\">NBIX</a>)</strong> twice-daily, oral corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptor antagonist Crenessity (crinecerfont) won an approval from the FDA as an-add on to classic glucocorticoid replacement therapy for CAH in December 2024.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Balance Sheet &amp; Analyst Commentary:</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To finance its clinical and commercial ambitions, Crinetics held cash and securities of $1.20 billion on June 30, 2025, providing it an operating runway into 2029.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"817\" data-height=\"768\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CRNX Price Targets\" width=\"640\" height=\"602\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/498952-1761741660700958_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">CRNX Price Targets <span>(TipRanks)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Street is enamored by Crinetics’ prospects, as can be seen above. On average, sell-side analysts <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRNX/earnings/estimates\"><strong>expect</strong></a> Palsonify to achieve blockbuster status by 2029 with sales of $1.19 billion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Verdict:</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sporting a market cap of ~$2.8 billion net of current cash and sales projections of ~$1.2 billion in FY29, shares of CRNX would appear to have additional upside. That said, the market for acromegaly right now is not huge. Given that it is already a crowded treatment market, Palsonify is Crinetics’ first commercial rodeo, pivotal trials for other indications (carcinoid, adult CAH, pediatric CAH, and Cushing’s) are only set to initiate over the ensuing 12 months, and Crenessity’s head start in CAH, analysts’ FY29 mean outlook appears optimistic. As such, I expect a pullback after the recent runup on Palsonify’s approval. If CRNX comes back down to the mid-$30s, I will likely take an initial position in the stock via <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>covered call</strong></a> orders. In the meantime, I will wait to see a couple of quarters of sales results to ascertain how the early stage marketing rollout is going for its newly approved treatment.</p>",

At the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4815267-futu-holdings-limited-futu-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4815267-futu-holdings-limited-futu-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">analyst briefing</a>, it explained that a rise in \"cash positions within their (clients') portfolios\" more than offset \"meaningful HIBOR declines.\" Its interest income outlook has become brighter now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Separately, its operations related to digital assets probably had a good performance in the latest quarter. <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/hashkey-exchange\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/exchanges/hashkey-exchange\" target=\"_blank\">CoinGecko's</a> data suggests that the \"<span>a</span>verage daily volume\" or \"ADV\" for \"HashKey\" grew three-fifths higher QoQ for 3Q25. The latter is an exchange used by FUTU to provide \"cryptocurrency trading\" according to a \"South China Morning Post\" <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3272822/online-brokerage-futu-offers-crypto-trading-hong-kong-nvidia-alibaba-stock-reward\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3272822/online-brokerage-futu-offers-crypto-trading-hong-kong-nvidia-alibaba-stock-reward\" target=\"_blank\">commentary piece</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm predicting that the enterprise will announce a doubling of non-GAAP earnings from 3Q24's HK$1,398<span> million</span> to 3Q2025's HK$2.8<span> billion</span> next month. This also translates into a 5% improvement sequentially.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">But Policy-Related Changes Are An Issue</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The regulatory authorities' actions can have a big impact on companies operating in the financial sector like FUTU.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recent news flow has gotten me worried about the group's prospects for the final quarter of '25 and the following year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FUTU's crypto-focused expansion initiatives might have taken a setback.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Barclays (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BCS\" title=\"Barclays PLC\">BCS</a>) issued a note (not publicly available) titled \"Seeking A Path To Riches\" on July 17, 2025. The bank's research indicated that FUTU is \"one of the leading applicants\" for \"licenses to issue stablecoins in HK.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company was asked about the \"crypto (stablecoin) exchange license in Hong Kong\" at its Q2 earnings call. It responded by saying that it is \"in the Phase 2 of the VATP (Virtual Asset Trading Platform) license application in Hong Kong\" and \"doing the feasibility studies for more license applications in other markets.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think it is reasonable to infer that FUTU is actively exploring stablecoin-related opportunities, which could broaden its revenue base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But \"Financial Times\" <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8bc1fcfa-8c69-4de0-b6cb-ab6f7117558b\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8bc1fcfa-8c69-4de0-b6cb-ab6f7117558b\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> on Oct. 19 \"PBoC (People’s Bank of China) officials advised against participating in the initial stablecoin rollout over concerns about allowing tech groups and brokerages to issue any type of currency.\" The same write-up also mentioned that \"Chinese tech giants have paused plans to issue stablecoins in Hong Kong, after Beijing raised concerns.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's highly possible that the implementation of new stablecoin legislation in HK is delayed. This takes into account the Chinese policymakers' unfavorable stance regarding crypto.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My view is that FUTU's long-term growth ceiling has become lower with the regulatory developments of late. Any stablecoin-related valuation premium is also no longer justified for the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, the firm's AUM growth could be hurt by China's greater scrutiny of taxation pertaining to overseas investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Legal firm \"Morgan Lewis\" highlighted in an Oct. 24 <a href=\"https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2025/10/chinas-new-tax-reporting-rules-are-a-game-changer-for-overseas-internet-platforms\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2025/10/chinas-new-tax-reporting-rules-are-a-game-changer-for-overseas-internet-platforms\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> that \"the Chinese government has introduced a set of new regulations requiring internet platforms to report tax-related information.\" \"Platforms providing services\" like \"brokerage\" are among those affected by the updated rules.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mainland Chinese have been keen on participating in the Hong Kong stock market. A major reason is because the city doesn't impose any levies on capital gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My thoughts are that the PRC's onshore investors might decide to turn their attention back to domestic equities listed in Shanghai/Shenzhen. FUTU's HK-listed financial products may be less popular going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The consensus is already projecting that the company's EPS growth goes from +67% in 2025 to +15% for 2026 based on S&amp;P Capital IQ data. The actual slowdown might be more severe with these adverse policy shifts.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">My Closing Remarks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FUTU remains a hold-rated name. Its next 12 months' P/E is 18.3x (source: S&amp;P Capital IQ).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The average forward earnings multiple for FUTU's peers UP Fintech (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TIGR\" title=\"UP Fintech Holding Limited\">TIGR</a>) and Interactive Brokers (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBKR\" title=\"Interactive Brokers Group, Inc.\">IBKR</a>) is 21x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock's upside is +15% (21/18.3) pegged to its listed comparables. I require a capital appreciation of at least 20% to warrant a \"Buy.\" It doesn't meet this criterion.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FUTU doesn't have clear-cut re-rating drivers. The potential Q3 beat is negated by policy-related headwinds.</p>",

Looking at the longer term, we see $1.9 billion in acquisitions over the past 6 years compared to over $1.3 billion sold over the past 5 years, which is definitely a massive amount considering the company's size, although falling occupancy rates probably offset this for now, making a potential recovery even better.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One such move is the recent acquisition of the Legacy Union Parking Garage at 720 South Church Street in Charlotte <a href=\"https://s23.q4cdn.com/319093197/files/doc_news/Highwoods-Acquires-Legacy-Union-Parking-Garage-at-720-South-Church-Street-in-Charlotte-2025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">for a $111.5 million total investment</a>, supporting their owned Legacy Union office, whose customers represent ~70% of the annual revenue, leased on a long-term basis with a remaining contractual term of 9 years.

Naturally, these have very significant effects, especially on REITs, being great for them in several ways. The effects of rate hikes/cuts are ultimately the reason behind the central bank’s decisions, made in an effort to steer the economy and fight inflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, I know this may seem like common knowledge for most of you, but I’m surprised by how many people I’ve seen (especially in recent months) that call REITs bad because they underperformed in recent years as rates were hiked. I like REITs as an asset class and I believe they can serve essential roles in many portfolios, so it’s a shame for someone to pass on these ideas thinking they’re bad just because they performed as they should in a high-rate environment. This is ultimately what this asset class is supposed to do because the business model is almost all about interest rates, basically playing with the spread between their cost of debt and return on their leases/investments—the difference being what they give back to us as shareholders, a bit of capital for investing/other uses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, not only do they reduce the interest expenses on the company’s debt (HIW’s interest expenses got to a record of ~$150 million TTM), having a direct impact on the company’s AFFO and other metrics, but they can also help the tenants in similar ways, providing improved financial flexibility in a time when many businesses need it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, the market’s seems quite pessimistic around the US economy, although we’ve seen some improvements lately with Trump’s sanctions on Russia, India and China’s halt of Russian oil acquisitions, etc., but that’s more about global trade and we’re still looking at what is so far the second-largest government shutdown, huge levels of debt, renewed trade war fears, and more risks that can stem from these factors. For example, I see that the market is also worried that the <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/story/2025/10/28/shutdown-means-less-data-for-fed-interest-rate-decision\" rel=\"nofollow\">shutdowns can result in less data for the Fed</a> to base its interest rate decisions on, which can lead to an uncertain position as Powell may be inclined to go for a more careful approach, potentially affecting the expectations for 2 more rate cuts this year. And that’s on top of the significant political uncertainty felt in this environment, potentially leading to a bad or even worse scenario for this asset class.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1461\" data-height=\"829\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Highwoods Properties IR HIW stock analysis seekingalpha valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"363\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60669497-1761744025780775_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Highwoods Properties IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This macro pressure is also felt in the company’s operations, with some of the lowest occupancy rates in recent history.

I’ll assume a WACC of 7.5% (above my estimated ~7.21% based on a cost of equity of ~9% and 5.5% cost of debt), with $3.44 billion worth of net debt plus preferred on 110.52 million shares outstanding as of the Q3 report. This way, we get to an enterprise value of $8.19 billion, meaning an equity value of $4.75 billion, for a price of $42.98, basically getting us to the levels from before the rate hikes and industry’s slump began.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusions</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I rate HIW a Buy given their quality, good margin of safety, and solid performance despite the industry’s headwinds, while also providing a good dividend. Risk remains especially in this environment, but the company’s solid fundamentals and attractive price should offset it once rate cuts advance and the economy recovers.</p>",

After several months of increasing headline inflation, the just-released inflation data points to a trend reversal. Headline inflation, according to the national measure, decreased to 2.3% year-on-year in October, from 2.4% YoY in<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> September. The European measure also came down to 2.3% YoY. Core inflation remained unchanged at 2.8% YoY, while services inflation even increased somewhat to 3.5% YoY, from 3.4% YoY.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Moving towards 2%</span></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The available regional state data shows that the drop in German inflation was mainly driven by favourable base effects. On the month, almost all categories saw prices slightly increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, the stronger euro and still-favourable energy base effects should push German inflation back towards - and below - 2% over the coming months. At the same time, the worsening labour market and AI will further moderate wage growth. Finally, US tariffs could also bring disinflationary pressures to Europe due to overcapacity and weaker sales in the US. While these elements clearly bring disinflationary forces to Germany over the coming months, the longer-term picture brings more upward pressure on inflation. Restructuring of supply chains, labour costs in an era of ageing and the green transition remain three important structural drivers of price pressures. And not to forget, the inflationary impact from Germany’s fiscal stimulus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In short, today’s inflation reading marks another turning point and the start of at least a short-lived period of rather disinflationary pressures before inflationary forces take over again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

EM stocks rallied and broadly outperformed developed markets as trade tensions generally subsided, the euphoria around artificial intelligence ('AI') persisted and expectations rose for more interest rate cuts<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> from the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chinese markets outperformed much of the globe. China posted some of the strongest returns, marking three straight months of outpacing its EM peers. Easing trade tensions with the U.S., policy support for chipmakers and accelerating spending on AI drove gains amid hopes that the government's policy to combat price wars and disinflation will help the Chinese economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Information technology stocks drove quarterly outperformance. The sector was home to three top contributors, including Zhongji Innolight, electronics manufacturing company Delta Electronics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DLEGF\" title=\"Delta Electronics (Thailand) Public Company Limited\">OTCPK:DLEGF</a>) and chip designer company Montage Technology. We believe Delta rallied amid positive earnings surprises, strong performance in electric vehicles and data centers, and growth expectations around global electrification trends and AI infrastructure expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financials was an area of relative strength. Stocks we did not hold helped power gains in the sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positioning in materials hindered relative performance. Lack of exposure to many sector names that we did not own was a key driver to underperformance, along with an underweight to South Africa-based mining group Gold Fields (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GFI\" title=\"Gold Fields Limited\">GFI</a>) relative to the benchmark.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Contributors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Zhongji Innolight. We believe a strong earnings report and artificial intelligence (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AI\" title=\"C3.ai, Inc.\">AI</a>)-driven demand supported the stock. Zhongji Innolight is a key supplier of high-end optical transceivers for AI data centers and 5G networks, a focus of global AI capital spending cycles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Delta Electronics. Positive earnings surprises and strong performance in electric vehicles and data centers lifted shares. The company raised earnings forecasts, reflecting confidence in its growth trajectory. We believe Delta, a key supplier of AI power, is benefiting from global electrification trends and AI infrastructure expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Montage Technology. The company reported surging revenue and net profit growth, and our research indicated that it has continued to enlarge its presence in the scale-up networking market, while maintaining stable growth in its interface integrated circuit business.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Detractors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Xiaomi. We believe the stock was weak amid competition in the smartphone space, a seasonal slowdown in the Internet of Things segment and rising costs, as higher-than-expected operating expenses weighed on earnings. Our research also indicated that a slower-than-expected new factory ramp-up drove lower volume forecasts for electric vehicles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ICICI Bank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBN\" title=\"ICICI Bank Limited\">IBN</a>). The stock underperformed due to what we believed was a mix of margin pressure, rising gross nonperforming assets and concerns about consumer credit demand and asset quality. Net interest margin declined, and management warned that margins may fall further if interest rates fall. Deposit growth was also weaker than anticipated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alibaba (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BABA\" title=\"Alibaba Group Holding Limited\">BABA</a>) Group Holding. An underweight to the China-based e-commerce giant relative to the benchmark weighed on returns as the stock advanced during the period.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notable Trades</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HKXCF\" title=\"Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited\">OTCPK:HKXCF</a>). The securities and derivatives exchange is the key conduit of capital flows to and from mainland China. With policy support for capital markets activity and area economies driving flow activity, we believe increased initial public offering activity and the Stock Connect program reforms will likely support the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Montage Technology. The company is a fabless firm mainly engaged in designing and selling memory interface chips, with end markets focused on servers and data centers. We believe solid growth in memory interface chips and a fast ramp-up of new products have helped create a more promising growth outlook for Montage Technology.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China State Construction International Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCOHF\" title=\"China State Construction International Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:CCOHF</a>). We exited CSCI amid what we believed were ongoing challenges in China's construction and infrastructure space, including slower project approvals and continuing weakness in the real estate market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BYD (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BYDDF\" title=\"BYD Company Limited\">OTCPK:BYDDF</a>). We exited BYD amid what we believed were weaker-than-expected earnings, slowing domestic demand and intensifying competition in China's electric vehicle market. BYD missed consensus profit estimates and cut its 2025 sales target as government pressure to end aggressive price wars, which had helped fuel BYD's rapid growth, weighed on the company.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio Positioning</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The portfolio continues to invest in companies where we believe financials are strong and improving but share price performance does not fully reflect these factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our outlook remains constructive. In our view, emerging markets (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EM\" title=\"Smart Share Global Limited\">EM</a>) equities have been supported by strong company performance, stabilizing U.S. trade policy and anticipated interest rate cuts from the U.S. Fed. We believe the growth gap between EM and developed markets (DM) will remain robust, with EM economies' growth rates expected to improve in 2026, while the U.S. and some other DM are projected to weaken.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EM valuations, earnings growth potential provide separation. We believe EM companies typically offer more attractive valuations and the prospect of higher earnings growth than many global DM peers. Given the often strong inverse relationship between EM equities and the dollar, we think a weaker U.S. dollar could also function as a growth driver for EM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Government policy efforts a key in China. The summer tariff pause between the U.S. and China has helped improve market sentiment toward China. We think that while domestic economic growth may moderate in the short term, the Chinese government's targeted approach to increasing domestic demand will likely support profitability, while easing deflation and oversupply. We believe that if the government is successful, demand improvement could be sizable and would likely reverberate across other emerging markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EM companies are central to global technology and artificial intelligence (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AI\" title=\"C3.ai, Inc.\">AI</a>) supply chains. Our research has indicated that while high tariff rates may provide headwinds in markets such as India and Brazil, South Korea, China and Taiwan are among the nations that have benefited from rapidly increasing investment in AI and AI-driven sentiment, pushing equities to all-time highs in many markets. During the quarter, many of the world's largest tech firms—hyperscalers including Alphabet ((GOOG) (GOOGL)), Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) and Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>)—revealed plans to increase their capital expenditures, affirming their commitment to AI-related spending despite some investor concerns that they might dial things back, especially in early 2025.</p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Goal and Strategy:</strong> Long-term capital growth by investing primarily in emerging market companies of all sizes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Portfolio Management Team</strong></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead> <tr> <th>Name</th> <th>Start Date</th> <th></th> </tr> <tr> <th></th> <th>Industry</th> <th>Company</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Patricia Ribeiro</td> <td>1984</td> <td>2006</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sherwin Soo, CFA</td> <td>1995</td> <td>2011</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Top 10 Holdings (%)</strong></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody> <tr> <td>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>)</td> <td>11.09</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tencent Holdings Ltd (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCEHY\" title=\"Tencent Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:TCEHY</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCTZF\" title=\"Tencent Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:TCTZF</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TCEHY\" title=\"Tencent Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:TCEHY</a>)</td> <td>7.54</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Alibaba Group Holding Ltd</td> <td>4.18</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Samsung Electronics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\">OTCPK:SSNLF</a>) Co Ltd</td> <td>3.74</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Xiaomi Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XIACF\" title=\"Xiaomi Corporation\">OTCPK:XIACF</a>)</td> <td>2.37</td> </tr> <tr> <td>SK Hynix Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HXSCF\" title=\"SK hynix Inc.\">OTCPK:HXSCF</a>)</td> <td>2.15</td> </tr> <tr> <td>NetEase (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTES\" title=\"NetEase, Inc.\">NTES</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NETTF\" title=\"NetEase, Inc.\">OTCPK:NETTF</a>) Inc</td> <td>2.07</td> </tr> <tr> <td>ICICI Bank Ltd</td> <td>2.07</td> </tr> <tr> <td>HDFC Bank Ltd (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HDB\" title=\"HDFC Bank Limited\">HDB</a>)</td> <td>2.02</td> </tr> <tr> <td>China Construction Bank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CICHY\" title=\"China Construction Bank Corporation\">OTCPK:CICHY</a>) Corp</td> <td>2.01</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td>As of 9/30/2025<em>The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security.

Q3 2025 results gave<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> even more conviction that my investment thesis for VLTO would play out. With a robust demand outlook for the WQ segment and the product innovation strategy supporting the PIQ segment, I expect growth to eventually accelerate, and that would drive up multiples.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong Q3 2025 results support the bull thesis.</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VLTO delivered another solid quarter in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20283295-veralto-reports-third-quarter-2025-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A1\">Q3 2025</a>, reinforcing my bullish view on this company. Total sales grew 6.9% y/y to $1.404 billion, with core sales up 5.1% (this is the fifth straight quarter of mid-single-digit growth). Both volume and pricing contributed positively for all segments. Water Quality [WQ] saw revenue up 7% y/y to $856 million and core growth of 5.3%, led by North America (6% y/y) and high-growth markets (7.1% y/y). EBIT margin for WQ expanded 150 bps y/y to 26.3%. As for Product Quality &amp; Innovation [PQI], revenue grew 6.9% y/y to $548 million (core growth was 4.6%), driven by North America (9.2%) and 330 bps of price contribution to offset tariffs. While the PQI margin dipped to 25.4%, it was mainly due to acquisitions and tariff mitigation, not structural factors. Adj. EPS grew 11% y/y to $0.99, beating the high end of guidance by $0.04, and management raised FY25 adj. EPS guidance to $3.82–$3.85 (from $3.72–$3.80). Overall, the quarter was good.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The WQ segment continues to ride powerful secular waves.</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have become more confident about the WQ segment performance after looking at the developments so far. Core sales accelerated sequentially to 5.3% y/y growth, and notably, this momentum was broad-based, supported by both water treatment and water analytics. But perhaps the more important takeaway was the clearer link between VLTO growth and the global AI infrastructure investment theme.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The semiconductor angle I discussed earlier this year is clearly playing out, but the first distinction today is that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834673-veralto-corporation-vlto-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">management has explicitly called</a> out the opportunity tied directly to data centers (which is really driven largely by the major cloud and hyperscale players) as well as related sub-segments like power generation. As a recap, the basic idea here is that these facilities require substantial volumes of water for cooling, and this plays right up into VLTO’s strength. Operators need to rely on VLTO to help maintain uptime while at the same time reduce both water and energy consumption. You could, in fact, see VLTO’s water solution as mission critical because without it, the entire data center will not work well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We have very high visibility to the demand outlook here as well, which makes the equity story even more attractive. The latest earnings from hyperscalers such as <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835092-microsoft-corporation-msft-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">Microsoft</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835072-alphabet-inc-googl-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Alphabet</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) show us just how massive this AI infrastructure build-out has become. Take MSFT, for instance; its commercial remaining purchase obligation [RPO] grew &gt;50% y/y to ~$400 billion, with an incremental $250 billion Azure commitment from OpenAI alone. The more impressive data point is that MSFT expects to increase AI capacity by &gt;80% in FY25 and roughly double their data center footprint within two years. This implies a significant acceleration in data center investments. A similar picture is painted by GOOGL, which saw its Google Cloud backlog grow 46% sequentially to $155 billion, which is also driven primarily by AI-related workloads. Both companies even came out explicitly saying that they will remain capacity-constrained well into next year as demand continues to outpace supply.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, this is not a case of whether data center investments will come through, but one that is going to happen.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">PQI Is Executing Well</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As expected, the PQI segment got impacted by tariff impacts, and like I noted in my February write-up, navigating the tariff environment would be a key test for VLTO. Encouragingly, Q3’s results confirm VLTO is managing it well. Contrary to my belief that VLTO will lose pricing power, it actually managed to push pricing upwards, which contributed 330 bps to core growth. This shows that the adjustments made earlier this year have helped VLTO to fully offset tariff costs going forward. The key line item here, I think, is volume growth. VLTO actually managed to push pricing upwards with volume growing (volume up 1.3% y/y), which suggests a very healthy end-market demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A big part of this pricing power comes from VLTO’s product innovation strategy, of which the highlight of this quarter was Videojet, which saw strong adoption for the refreshed Continuous Ink Jet [CIJ] and laser printer lineup. I expect adoption to remain strong here, giving VLTO pricing power, as the new UV laser marking system is just a way better product that replaces older technologies. There are two key upgrades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, it provides an alternative to thermal transfer overlay [TTO] systems (this is the widely used legacy method). The difference lies in the marking process itself. TTO uses a heated print head to press ink from a ribbon onto the film, requiring direct contact and ongoing consumable ribbons. But for VLTO's new UV laser technology, it uses precise chemical change directly on the film surface using a light beam, which creates a permanent mark without contact, heat, or consumables. The result is not only better reliability (fewer chemical reactions needed) but also lower long-term operating costs (less heat and fewer consumables used).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, and perhaps more importantly in today’s market, the UV laser helps customers transition to more sustainable flexible film packaging. With the UV laser technology, customers will produce way less ribbon waste and at the same time also be able to use thinner films (lesser materials used vs. thicker films that are needed to withstand heat from TTO technology). This effectively allows CPG companies to work towards their ESG goals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, I’d say that while PQI’s margins remain temporarily affected by tariff mitigation and ongoing growth investments, the overall results were positive. As we roll into next year, PQI will face an easy comp as it continues to enjoy pricing power, supported by the new product innovation strategy.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FCF and balance sheet</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I also think it's worth putting attention on VLTO’s free cash flow [FCF] and balance sheet situation. In Q3, VLTO generated $258 million in FCF, which was up 20% y/y, pushing year-to-date FCF to &gt;$700 million. This is a very comforting performance because it means that VLTO can continue to invest aggressively in its R&amp;D without worrying about liquidity issues. This adds strength to the balance sheet, which existed in Q3 with ~$1.8 billion in cash and net leverage at just 0.7x. With this leverage ratio, VLTO has the choice to take on debt to ramp up investments or acquire strategically. On the latter, management did note in the call that M&amp;A remains the top capital allocation priority, and they are seeing an active pipeline of targets across both WQ and PQI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I believe the fundamentals remain strong, and VLTO has a strong balance sheet to support this growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With my views unchanged for VLTO’s fundamentals (which, in fact, have gotten better), I think the valuation de-rating seen so far has been unwarranted. VLTO is now trading at just 17x forward EBITDA, a discount from its average of ~19x. The market seems to be penalizing VLTO for the softer Q4 core growth guidance (low single-digit percentage), which I think is unfair given that Q4 has three fewer shipping days. Adjusting for those, growth would’ve been mid-single-digits. Also, the large data center demand opportunity has yet to be realized in VLTO’s books. As the big boys like MSFT and GOOGL ramp up spending, we should see growth acceleration for VLTO WQ’s segment. At the current 17x, I think the market is not pricing in any growth acceleration at all, and as I said before, once VLTO shows that, multiples should re-rate upwards easily. I would think a re-rate to 19x (the average) is a very possible range in the next couple of quarters.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The ongoing volatility in trade policies and tariffs are key uncertainties. While current mitigation actions (such as targeted pricing and supply chain adjustments) have worked, there is no guarantee that further policy shifts would not happen. Should they happen and the impacts be worse, VLTO will be impacted. VLTO is also investing heavily in growth initiatives, which carry some form of execution risk. Any delays or inefficiencies in these projects could temporarily weigh on margins.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My view for VLTO remains a buy rating. The fundamentals here continue to strengthen, with visible demand drivers, solid execution, and a balance sheet that provides flexibility. I believe the current valuation at ~17x forward EBITDA is an attractive entry point, especially ahead of potential growth acceleration from AI-related infrastructure opportunities.</p>",

I had put the stock on hold, awaiting more clarity. The drop after the report is confirming that. The company is giving a lower forecast, the renewals of old on-prem contracts have been going weakly, and hence the SaaS migration is the key to getting the right execution. Investors have lowered the multiple, thus getting rid of the valuation premium. It's not that I foreshadowed it, but it was the probable result when expectations and reality met ​‍​‌‍​‍‌head-on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this, I don't want to throw the company away, because the business isn't \"broken.\" The data-first approach is working, the SaaS share is high, and FCF remains a good cushion overall. That said, I don't feel like my view on the stock has changed, and I'll explain why. True, it's become cheaper, and certainly attractive at -48% compared to the other day, but until operating leverage is clearly and consistently visible, the valuation remains fragile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the following paragraphs, I summarize the quarterly numbers, update growth and margins, and define a 12-month target with my buy zone and risk levels.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Varonis's <a href=\"https://s203.q4cdn.com/582009126/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Varonis-Investor-Deck-3Q25-FINAL.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">quarterly results</a> divided the market, because, on closer inspection, the numbers aren't all that bad. What investors and analysts (myself included) didn't like is that the company confirmed that its transformation to SaaS has entered the most difficult phase.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">#What worked</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The good part of the quarter is that growth hasn't stopped. As the company's presentation shows, annual recurring revenues (ARR for short) rose to $718.6 million, up 18% year over year, with SaaS now accounting for 76% of the total. This proves that the recurring subscription model is now working as it should and that old contracts installed on customer servers are quickly disappearing.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"549\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Varonis\" width=\"640\" height=\"350\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618189700836427_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Varonis</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cash generation capacity also remained very strong; in the first nine months, the company generated over $111 million in free cash flow, up from $88 million in the same period last year. The outlook for the future should also be positive in this regard. Considering it's undergoing a costly transformation (with heavy investments to move everything to the cloud), this is a sign of very careful financial management.

The CEO himself acknowledged that the rate of renewals won't get back to usual until the second half of 2026, therefore determining the monetizing of the SasS model will come around twelve to eighteen months minimum.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">#Let's summarize</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's keep it simple and tell you what I think. Here we have a company with an interesting and solid business, the demand for data security is growing (just look around and understand the world we live in), and the financial position is strong, but the operating cycle is still in the difficult part. The stock isn't bad, as I said, but patience is needed. Those who have it can hold onto the stock or increase their exposure, taking advantage of yesterday's plunge. Those who don't have it might be better to wait a little longer. Until margins recover and operating leverage emerges, it will be difficult to see a structural rerating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation &amp; Target Price</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To value a stock of this caliber and under these conditions, as transparently as possible, I prefer to first look at cash flow. According to the company, FCF is expected to be between $120 and $125 million for 2025, with net cash of approximately $1.1 billion and 134.8 million diluted shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Framing the issue, for a software company still in the transition phase toward the cloud, I find it appropriate to assign a range of multiples between 20x and 30x FCF (consistent with the current risk/return profile).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Below 20x, growth is priced in under pressure or a loss of momentum.</li> <li>Above 30x, full operating leverage is already assumed, which, however, is not reflected in the numbers we see today.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All things considered, with $120–$125 million in FCF and $1.1 billion in net cash, the implied equity value comes to $26–$36 per share, depending on the multiple previously applied. As always, I want to be conservative and realistic in my valuations, and I've chosen the midpoint of the guidance, choosing 28x, which gives me a 12-month fair value of $34.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock is trading at around $32 at the time of writing, so in my opinion the market is already pricing in around 29–30x [FCF], which represents an improvement in margins that hasn't yet been reflected in the financial statements. To sustainably push above $36, operating leverage would need to become visible in the next two quarters, with margins and retention clearly improving. Maybe that will be the case, but for now, no, and I don't feel like going any further.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, I'm maintaining my \"Hold\" rating. My view would only change if we see non-GAAP margins return to positive territory and a tangible acceleration in the SaaS mix. For that, we'll have to wait for the company's next earnings releases.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks &amp; Opportunities</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's move on to the final part of the analysis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For me, the biggest risk is that Varonis continues to grow without improving margins. The transition to SaaS is almost complete, but the model hasn't yet demonstrated the operating leverage the market expects. Indeed, as management has confirmed, monetization is being pushed further and further into the future, which is very uncomfortable for investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other major issue concerns the strong market competition. We're facing players like Microsoft, AWS, and Palo Alto, which are meanwhile integrating AI-based data protection and security features into their platforms. If these solutions were to consolidate, Varonis might find itself with less room to raise prices in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, what I like about the stock is that it has a solid balance sheet, with over $1 billion in cash and a recently authorized $150 million buyback. Additionally, the company has room to reduce sales costs and streamline its go-to-market process. But it takes time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What would I do now?</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The collapse isn't enough to call it a deal. Operationally, I'm not chasing a rebound and am maintaining \"Hold.\" As I said before, I'm not worried about the balance sheet, but rather the execution and even the strong competition. The product is good and is well into its cycle; the problem now is figuring out how to monetize it, and especially when. I've seen management is worried, and this keeps me firm on my June idea, which I confirm today.</p>",

While there may be some merit to that argument, I do not place much emphasis on it. The unfortunate situation in Gaza has been ongoing for a while, and most did not worry about the conflict affecting oil prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As far as Russia is concerned, it has been producing aggressively throughout the last several years to help fund its economy and its war efforts. While some might believe that a ceasefire would reduce geopolitical risk, which is true, and ought therefore to reduce oil prices, I take a different view. Reduced tensions would allow for rebuilding and more confidence throughout Europe. More confidence means more economic activity, causing more demand for fossil fuels. As we know, the hoped-for ceasefire in Ukraine has not materialized and fighting continues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For a few days in October, there were heightened fears of another US regional banking crisis. Fortunately, the cockroaches, a term Jamie Dimon used to describe potential hidden credit risks in the economy, never fully materialized. At least for now, this issue is not a problem.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The US government shutdown has not been a major theme in the oil markets, though it is contributing to some uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In September, most thought that the US and China were making great strides toward a new tariff arrangement. And then in early October, China indicated that it plans to expand its export controls over its rare earths. That caused a rupture in the tariff negotiations. In the past two weeks, both sides appear to be making efforts to repair some of the damage, and the two leaders are due to meet later this week. As an indication of reduced tensions, The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/china/trump-xi-to-discuss-lowering-china-tariffs-for-fentanyl-crackdown-8094fe83\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"WSJ: “Trump, Xi to Discuss Lowering China Tariffs for Fentanyl Crackdown\">features an article</a> today “Trump, Xi to Discuss Lowering China Tariffs for Fentanyl Crackdown” (subscription required) that suggest both sides are seeking a de-escalation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Should the US and China make concrete progress toward lessening of tensions and tariffs, that would increase confidence in both countries and lend more support to increased oil prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When the IEA published its bearish outlook, oil prices were knocked lower. The Financial Times <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e9f5ed18-5ca2-4154-9982-40616121a69d\" title=\"Oil tumbles to five-month low on report of ‘large surplus’\" rel=\"nofollow\">published</a> “Oil tumbles to five-month low on report of ‘large surplus’” (subscription required), where it mentioned that prices were expected to go even lower.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>The recent surplus of crude comes after China and other economies had been increasing their stockpiles, with global observed inventories at a four-year high from January to August this year, according to the IEA.</p> <p>Its estimate of an overhang is in contrast to the view of Opec, which said that “despite speculative activity in the futures market, near-term physical crude fundamentals remained broadly supportive of the market”, in a monthly report on Monday. It maintained its forecast for global oil demand in 2025 from the previous month.</p> <p>Speaking at the Energy Intelligence Forum in London, Ben Luckock, the head of oil trading at Trafigura, said he expected prices could fall below $60 a barrel before rallying.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Luckock is referring to Brent oil prices, which typically exceed WTI oil prices anywhere from $2 to $4 per barrel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/iea-forecasts-bigger-oil-surplus-with-global-inventories-soon-set-to-rise-752e585b\" title=\"WSJ: IEA Forecasts Bigger Oil Surplus, With Global Inventories Soon Set to Rise\" rel=\"nofollow\">published</a> “IEA Forecasts Bigger Oil Surplus, With Global Inventories Soon Set to Rise” (subscription required), where it mentioned a forecasted oil supply growth of three million barrels a day.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>The Paris-based organization now forecasts oil-supply growth of 3 million barrels a day this year and 2.4 million the next, from earlier estimates of 2.7 million and 2.1 million barrels a day, respectively. Global demand, however, is expected to grow by 710,000 barrels a day and 699,000 barrels a day over the periods.</p> <p>“The oil market has been in surplus since the start of the year, but stock builds have so far been concentrated in crude in China and gas liquids in the U.S.,” the IEA said.</p> <p>Middle Eastern oil production surged by September as OPEC+ countries ramped up output. However, seasonal demand remained subdued, leaving the region with a larger surplus of crude oil available for export. This, combined with robust oil flows from the Americas, resulted in a massive buildup of oil in floating storage or in transit - the largest increase since the Covid-19 era.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The topic of oil in floating storage or oil-on-water has been debated endlessly on X. Some point to it as an indication of a large, impending glut of oil, while others believe it has been overplayed in the media and by some traders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is an X post by Javier Blas of Bloomberg showing the buildup of crude-in-transit or oil-on-water:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/20137021-17618283742733977.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart showing buildup of crude-in-transit or oil-on-water\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"\" data-source=\"\" width=\"569\" height=\"823\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/20137021-17618283742733977.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/20137021-17618283742733977.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/20137021-17618283742733977.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/20137021-17618283742733977.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/20137021-17618283742733977.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/20137021-17618283742733977.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/20137021-17618283742733977.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/20137021-17618283742733977.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Eric Nuttall shares his thoughts toward the latter part of his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqtkkJP9A70\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent YouTube video</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After listening to Dr. Anas Alhajji on <a href=\"https://x.com/i/spaces/1ZkKzZWBaBXKv\" title=\"Dr. Anas Alhajji X Space: Oil Market Update: Debunking the Hype of Oil on Water \" rel=\"nofollow\">his X Space</a>, I became convinced that the oil-on-water issue is overblown.

The questions are not whether there are builds but whether the builds are larger than normal and whether global inventories are larger than normal. If the answer to both questions is that builds are seasonally normal or smaller, then prices should remain relatively stable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering all this information, I do not see much upside to WTI oil prices. I strongly doubt it gets past $65 on the upside. And although it recently was in the mid-$50s, I tend to think that was during a wave of extreme pessimism when several stories were conspiring against oil. My expectation is that WTI oil prices will spend most of November in the high $50 to low $60s. As stated at the outset, my expected range is between $55 and $65 for November.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://speciousargument.com/blog/2025/10/29/oil-update-october-2025/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",
