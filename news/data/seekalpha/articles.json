This is a transformative deal, designed to gain more scale and boost margins<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> after both firms have seen very tough times recently.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The deal looks good on paper, but investors are not sold on the idea, potentially amidst added uncertainty at a tricky point in time, with both firms employing quite a bit of leverage in relation to minimal current earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In between all this, I see potential on paper, driven by ambitious synergy targets, yet a mixed track record of both firms makes me very cautious.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">About Ryerson</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ryerson describes its business as a leading distributor and metal solutions' provider across North America. The company generates about $4.6 billion in annual revenues from such products and services, half of which tied to carbon, a quarter to stainless steel and the remainder of aluminum. The company offers some 75,000 products, supplied to about 40,000 customers, across a wide spectrum of industries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These solutions are provided from no less than 110 operating locations, which employ some 4,300 workers. Despite a reasonable presence, the company is struggling with its margins, with EBITDA margins reported at just 2.5% of sales over the past year. It should be understood that both margins and sales were down substantially after a boom driven by an economic recovery and inflationary pressures in a post-pandemic era.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company operates in a highly fragmented market, which is dominated by Reliance (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RS\" title=\"Reliance, Inc.\">RS</a>), which reports nearly $14 billion in annual sales. Ryerson claims to be the second player in this market, being much smaller, competing against the likes of Kloeckner, Worthington and also Olympic Steel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the company has many plans to improve the business, Ryerson has seen some real struggles as a $3 billion business in 2015 saw sales peak at levels over $6 billion in 2022, with revenues now having fallen to $4.5 billion on a trailing basis. Historically, operating margins have come in anywhere between low single digit margins and high single digit margins, with the business recently even posting losses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This painful reversal made that a peak price around $40 per share in 2023 has come down to the low-twenties here.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Valuation</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alongside the deal announcement of Olympic, Ryerson <a href=\"https://ir.ryerson.com/news/news-details/2025/Ryerson-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.ryerson.com/news/news-details/2025/Ryerson-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> third quarter results. Year to date, revenues are down 3% and change to just below $3.5 billion, amidst flattish volumes and falling prices. The company actually managed to increase adjusted EBITDA in a minor way to $118 million, with net losses of $18 million working down to a loss of $0.58 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With 32 million shares trading at $23, a $736 million equity valuation excludes a substantial net debt load of $470 million, for a $1.2 billion pro forma enterprise valuation. This valued the business at just over 0.25 times sales and about 10 times EBITDA, these margins being minimal, and no earnings to show for.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">About The Deal</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Facing tougher times, the company has <a href=\"https://ir.ryerson.com/news/news-details/2025/Ryerson-and-Olympic-Steel-Announce-Merger-Agreement/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.ryerson.com/news/news-details/2025/Ryerson-and-Olympic-Steel-Announce-Merger-Agreement/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">reached</a> an agreement to acquire Olympic Steel as the deal has been labeled as a merger. The transaction is structured as an all-stock-merger with 1.7105 shares of Ryerson offered for every share outstanding in Olympic Steel, with investors in Olympic on a combined basis owning 37% of the share base, suggesting a pro forma share count of 51 million shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With some 20 million shares issued to investors in Olympic, these were valued at $460 million at $23 per share. Including a $234 million net debt load, the business is valued close to $700 million, implying a valuation close to 0.35 times sales at close to $2.0 billion here. The company is posting adjusted EBITDA close to $70 million per annum, for margins close to 3.5%, minimally higher than the margins reported by Ryerson.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pro forma EBITDA is seen around $190 million here, yet the combination operates with about $700 million in net debt, for elevated leverage ratios. The promise of the business is to deliver on $120 million in synergies, equal to 6% of the acquired sales. If this is realistic, EBITDA will increase to $300 million, for a leverage ratio in the low 2s, that is even at current depressed levels of industry profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the real impact after taxes is a potential $2 per share accretion number on the bottom line. This however comes amidst tiny losses reported, with both firms posting EBITDA margins at just between 2.5-3.5% of sales here. A near 2% synergy target in relation to pro forma sales looks a bit ambitious, again equal to 6% of added sales.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors Are Not Buying It</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Upon the deal announcement, shares have fallen from $23 and change to $21 and change, which makes that including the to be issued shares make for a $100 million decline in the pro forma market valuation here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This might come amidst a relatively higher sales multiple offered and fears about dilution for investors in Ryerson. However, this excludes potential synergies, and even as I deem the number to be highly optimistic, even a partial realization of synergies could still make the deal interesting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In theory, all this should be highly appealing, so the set-up of lower expectations and potential for large synergies looks interesting. However, the reality is that, in my view, two average operators are combined, also considering potential disruption from such a merger. Furthermore, the performance trails that of the absolute market leader Reliance in a huge way.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nonetheless, the potential of the deal to create value is compelling enough to keep a close eye on the development and achievements of the combined business going forward.</p>",

We also noted that Domino's<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> Pizza (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DPZ\" title=\"Domino's Pizza, Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">DPZ</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) and Mastercard (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MA\" title=\"Mastercard Incorporated\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">MA</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) were also looking like they were trading at some strong premium valuations. However, I dove into why I still felt that HD was worth holding for long-term dividend growth investors. Similarly, I would have made many of the same arguments for DPZ and MA at the time.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In general, I believe that the overall equity markets are looking fairly stretched in terms of valuation. That doesn't mean that a pullback or bear market is inevitable, but one certainly wouldn't be too surprising. There simply needs to be a catalyst that could send the major indexes lower. In particular, the Magnificent 7 names that make up such a large portion of the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite these days.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With all that said, I wanted to touch on some places where there still appears to be good value. That doesn't mean that these names won't decline in a market correction, but they could see a limited sell-off and could have further potential for upside going forward. As I'd view these as longer-term dividend growth holdings, I'm content being patient with these names—even if their share prices have appeared stubbornly low or even seen frustrating declines.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">#1 American States Water Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AWR\" title=\"American States Water Company\">AWR</a>) 2.72% Yield</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWR is a water utility company based in California, with its primary subsidiary of Golden State Water Company, delivering the largest slice of earnings. However, the company also operates the Bear Valley Electric Services and American States Utility Services subsidiaries. That can help to deliver some greater diversification for the company as it provides further geographic exposure across the U.S.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760530151409711_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AWR Earnings Segment Breakdown\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760530151409711_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760530151409711_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760530151409711_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760530151409711_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760530151409711_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760530151409711_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760530151409711_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760530151409711_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AWR Earnings Segment Breakdown <span>(American States Water Company)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWR trades over 15% off of its 52-week high and is down nearly 5% on a YTD basis. The share price has been going mostly sideways since going back to around late 2019. This has created a situation where it has 'fallen' out of its fair value range based on the historical P/E levels, as the company continued to see earnings growth, but the share price was not compensated for this growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605302589178066_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AWR Fair Value Share Price Range\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"270\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605302589178066_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605302589178066_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605302589178066_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605302589178066_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605302589178066_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605302589178066_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605302589178066_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605302589178066_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AWR Fair Value Share Price Range <span>(Portfolio Insight)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At least some of the pressure here is due to the overall higher valuation multiple that was placed on water utilities during a zero-rate environment. As rates rose on the short and long ends, that can make an income-generating investment like AWR look generally less appealing. Therefore, seeing a lower share price would send the dividend yield higher. Even now, the dividend yield could be considered on the lower end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, as the rate environment shifts and the Fed has resumed with a rate cut and is projected to have further rate cuts, it could be time to start seeing companies like AWR start to rise. Morningstar's fair value estimate is based on an algorithm, and it puts it at $80.33. Wall Street Analysts, more broadly, have the company rated as a 'Hold', but with an average price target that is similarly higher, at $81.50.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605304892622054_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AWR Average Price Target\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"217\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605304892622054_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605304892622054_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605304892622054_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605304892622054_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605304892622054_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605304892622054_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605304892622054_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605304892622054_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">AWR Average Price Target <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWR is also a dividend king, delivering <a href=\"https://americanstateswatercompany.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/american-states-water-company-announces-83-increase-quarterly-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">a raise earlier this year</a> on schedule for the 71st consecutive year.

There is also a K-1, for investors who are unfamiliar with EPD, though that is likely a relatively smaller portion of readers on this site—given that EPD is so popular.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EPD isn't as undervalued when compared to something like AWR above. Shares are off by 11.09% of their 52-week high, and YTD the units have declined by less than 2%. Most of the gains from this name are going to be derived from the higher distribution yield anyway, and a sideways price isn't all that uncommon for something that yields ~7%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Morningstar's analyst assigns a $33 unit price fair value estimate. Wall Street Analysts more broadly have it as a 'Buy' rating and an average price target of $35.72. Notably, that is estimating about 16% of upside from here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605311321524422_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EPD Average Price Target\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"202\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605311321524422_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605311321524422_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605311321524422_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605311321524422_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605311321524422_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605311321524422_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605311321524422_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605311321524422_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EPD Average Price Target <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In looking at the forward EV/EBITDA, EPD trades at around 10x, which is below its decade average of 11.3x. That could indicate that investors are slightly undervaluing EPD units compared to where they had historically been.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some of this could be due, again, to the higher rate environment, as EPD is considered an income-investment. Further, weakness in commodity prices has likely put a damper on investors' sentiment looking forward. While they have primarily fee-based contracts, they aren't completely immune to these prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On another valuation front, P/E is less reliable for MLPs in general. That said, EPD is a bit of an unusual exception because the business has interestingly delivered rather consistent EPS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760531000848606_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EPD EPS\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"261\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760531000848606_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760531000848606_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760531000848606_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760531000848606_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760531000848606_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760531000848606_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760531000848606_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-1760531000848606_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EPD EPS <span>(Portfolio Insight)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On that front, the fair value channel does have units currently slightly below the center of the fair value estimate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605310347576067_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EPD Unit Price Fair Valuation Range\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"262\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605310347576067_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605310347576067_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605310347576067_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605310347576067_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605310347576067_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605310347576067_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605310347576067_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/15/54359421-17605310347576067_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EPD Unit Price Fair Valuation Range <span>(Portfolio Insight)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the higher yield of around 7%, it does sacrifice has seen a sacrifice in the level of distribution growth over the years.

They noted that for the second quarter, it came in at $1.9 billion, which was a 7% increase from the prior year. That leaves plenty of cash left for EPD to continue to acquire and develop projects that can deliver further growth in earnings metrics going forward.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At one point, they announced an increase every quarter. They then went with annual raises around Covid, in 2020 and 2021. In the last several years, they've increased the announcement of raises to every two quarters. The more consistent increases can be a welcomed benefit to income investors, but the units haven't necessarily been rewarded with a higher price despite this. While EPD isn't looking the most undervalued here, I could see adding to this position.</p>",

Until the end of yesterday's trading session, the stock had barely moved<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> since, suggesting that the upside was sustained.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Come today, however, and the upside has now jumped to over 25%. Why? With its Q3 2025 results released, the company has raised earnings guidance. The development has gone down well with investors, with the stock up by more than 3% in today's session as I write. Here I discuss the latest quarterly numbers and guidance, but also point out risks to the outlook, which could impact the outlook negatively.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Robust Q3 2025 results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There's much to like about Eli Lilly's Q3 2025 results, starting with revenue growth. Among the first three quarters of 2025, the number saw its strongest increase in Q3 2025 of 54% YoY. As a result, the company's YTD revenue growth is now at 46% YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's diabetes and weight loss treatments, Mounjaro and Zepbound respectively, expectedly led the revenue growth. While Mounjaro more than doubled, rising by 109% YoY, Zepbound rose by an even bigger 185% YoY in Q3 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the non-GAAP gross margin at 83.6%, was slightly lower than the 84.1% level seen year-to-date, there's still much to like about it. First, the gross profit grew by a strong 56% YoY. Also, it's an improvement over the 82.2% margin seen in Q3 2024. This year, the company has also started reporting a non-GAAP margin called the performance margin, which is similar to the operating margin. This number too, looks good, as it rose to 48.3% in Q3 2025 compared with 45.9% in Q2 2025.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"946\" data-height=\"472\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Key financials, Q3 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"319\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618310476756601_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Eli Lilly</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Increased guidance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's non-GAAP EPS increase was even bigger, by almost 6x YoY, resulting in a guidance upgrade. Starting with revenues, the company has raised guidance by 3.7% at the midpoint, and now expects the number to land in the range of USD 63-65 billion. The guidance range for the performance margin has also been increased, based on higher expectations from sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Importantly, the non-GAAP EPS to come in the range of USD 23-23.7 in 2025. After a disappointment in Q1 2025, when Eli Lilly actually lowered guidance, it has now seen two consecutive quarters of an improved outlook. At the midpoint of this range, the expected adjusted EPS has exceeded even the midpoint of the initial guidance range of USD 22.5-24. At USD 0.1, the increase in midpoint is less than 0.5% increase, but the upgrade definitely looks better compared to the prior guidance. It's up by 4.4% at the midpoint.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"992\" data-height=\"510\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"2025 Guidance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"329\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/513629-17618315710678391_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Eli Lilly</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Market multiples look good</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the midpoint of the latest guidance range, LLY's forward non-GAAP P/E ratio comes to 34.84x. This is favorable compared to the stock's five-year average of 44.15x. As mentioned at the start, this indicates over 25% upside to the stock even now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering that the guidance has been upgraded for two consecutive quarters, it's also instructive to consider how the stock looks if the EPS comes in at the top end of the guidance range. The picture doesn't change much, with the forward P/E now at 34.3x, with the Buy case sustaining for the short term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks to outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, there are also risks to the outlook. The first of them is a possible agreement with the US government, as peers like Pfizer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>) and AstraZeneca (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AZN\" title=\"AstraZeneca PLC\">AZN</a>) have done recently. If it does come through, treatment prices are likely to be lower, which in turn can reduce margins. As I had pointed out in the previous article on Eli Lilly though, its margins have shown remarkable resilience in the past despite price reductions for Zepbound. But whether it happens again remains to be seen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A more concrete, though minuscule, drag on earnings can be the company's <a href=\"https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-acquire-adverum-biotechnologies\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-acquire-adverum-biotechnologies\" target=\"_blank\">recent purchase</a> of the clinical stage company, Adverum Biotechnologies (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ADVM\" title=\"Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc.\">ADVM</a>), which is developing therapies for ocular diseases. Eli Lilly intends to make a cash payment of USD 3.56 per share for the acquisition, which comes to a total of USD 74.4 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This doesn't make a significant dent to the company's earnings, but it does shave off some USD 0.08 from the EPS. Assuming that the payout shows up in the non-GAAP figures, the reduction from the midpoint of the guidance range wouldn't merit a change in outlook. And considering the company's robust earnings performance YTD, chances are that it can still continue to report an EPS towards the top end of the guidance range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, on the achievement of milestones, the payout per share can rise to as much as USD 12.47, which, of course, can have a more significant impact on the EPS. But whether these targets, based on the treatment's approval and sales goals, are met will only be known only over the years. In other words, the expense won't impact a single year's earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, keeping these risks in mind, it's worth considering whether the stock's prospects change if the EPS comes in at the lower end of the guidance range. Turns out, LLY isn't particularly worse off. The forward P/E rises to just 35.37x, which is still significantly below the five-year average.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's next?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Two weeks ago, there appeared to be a downside risk to Eli Lilly's earnings as an agreement with the US government was slated to be around the corner. Instead, it has delivered an earnings upgrade, backed by a robust performance in Q3 2025. The margins remain strong, and non-GAAP EPS growth has been exceptional.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">No matter how the latest guidance is looked at, the stock continues to look attractive even in the short term. This is despite the company's recent purchase of Adverum Biotechnologies, which isn't expected to make any meaningful dent in earnings. But the risk of lowering prices, as its peers have recently done, still persists.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We don't know what happens on that front next. Based on the information that is available, though, the prospects for Eli Lilly have only improved at the stock markets. For this reason, I'm retaining a Strong Buy on LLY.</p>",

ICVT has 364 holdings, a 30-day SEC yield of 1.09%, a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 1.77% and an expense ratio of 0.20%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As described in the prospectus by <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/products/272819/ishares-convertible-bond-etf\" rel=\"nofollow\">iShares</a>, the underlying index exclusively includes <em>cash pay convertible bonds</em>, a class of convertible bonds with an option to convert into shares of the issuer’s common stock (conversion is not mandatory). Other categories of convertible bonds (zero coupon, preferred and mandatory convertible bonds) are not eligible. Additionally, eligible securities must be U.S. dollar-denominated, have at least 31 days until maturity and $250 million of outstanding face value. There is no requirement on credit rating. The index is weighted based on market capitalization and rebalanced on a monthly basis. The portfolio turnover rate was 25% in the most recent fiscal year and 22% in the previous year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Convertible bonds are often used by growth-oriented companies, because optionality allows them to borrow money at a lower rate, and possibly avoid paying the principal, should the bond be converted. Optionality is also attractive for lenders willing to mix fixed income and speculation on share price. Convertible bonds are hybrid assets, so we can expect ICVT behavior to be between equity and fixed income.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>P</strong><strong>ortfolio</strong> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund is mostly invested in securities issued by U.S. companies (about 85% of asset value). Non-rated securities represents 75% of assets, while 17% has an investment grade and 5% is below investment grade. The weighted-average yield to maturity is 1.94% and the weighted-average maturity is 3.36 years (85% of assets has a maturity below 5 years). The sensitivity to rate variations is quite low, with an effective duration of 1.09 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The portfolio overweights the information technology sector (37.8% of asset value) and has significant exposure in consumer cyclicals (22.5%). Other sectors are below 8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/2496631-1761834428635711_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"665\" data-height=\"331\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/2496631-1761834428635711_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Sector breakdown in % of assets\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"319\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/2496631-1761834428635711_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/2496631-1761834428635711_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/2496631-1761834428635711_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/2496631-1761834428635711_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/2496631-1761834428635711_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/2496631-1761834428635711_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/2496631-1761834428635711_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/2496631-1761834428635711_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Sector breakdown in % of assets <span>(iShares)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund is diversified and risks related to individual companies are low.

But after Q2, the stock slumped heavily.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So what has changed?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Total (Sirius XM plus Pandora) revenues and adj. EBITDA were down slightly again, and so were subscriber numbers (both paying and trial subscribers). Self-pay subscribers were down even at Pandora. At the same time subscriber acquisition costs soared 19%. And despite the recent price increase ARPU was barely flat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A glimpse of hope could be seen in the promotional trial funnel at Sirius XM, which increased a tiny bit during the quarter, although it remained down YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As usual, the company managed to compensate for the lower subscriber numbers and acquisition cost increases by cutting other expenses, so that overall margins were also just slightly down YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given continued cost discipline and the already announced lower capex levels, the company could slightly increase its guidance by $25m across the board for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow to:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>• Total revenue of approximately $8.525 billion,</p> <p>• Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2.625 billion, and</p> <p>• Free cash flow of approximately $1.225 billion.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SIRI/balance-sheet\">Net debt</a> was also reduced slightly during the quarter, and interest expenses are falling compared to recent times. All in all, the market probably sees the light at the end of the tunnel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given lower promotional activity related to Sirius XM's streaming service, further subscriber losses were expected. The market probably also feared increasing churn in the overall subscriber base, but churn was stable. Moreover, the minimal subscriber loss of just 40,000 confirmed the recent trend of improving subscriber losses. Given less promotion, a loss of just 40,000 subs could hint to the possibility that, with just the streaming issue further behind, Sirius XM could even be able to grow its subscriber base again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result of it all, the market probably started to believe that Sirius XM will not only deliver $1.225B of FCF in 2025, but also the long-term guidance of $1.5B in 2027, given that capex is scheduled to decrease substantially from the currently high level:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1344\" data-height=\"752\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Declining capex schedule 2024-2028\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/11715181-17618416279035974_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Sirius XM Q3/25 slides</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With $150m less satellite capex, another $50m reduction of non-satellite capex, and lower interest payments due to lower debt levels, the company effectively needs very little growth to reach its targets: This year's $1.225B guidance plus $200m of capex reduction, plus about $75m of interest savings already makes exactly $1.5B with zero growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sirius XM will reduce leverage by about 0.5x EBITDA by 2027, which means a net debt reduction of about $1.3B. This also looks very achievable, given the current and expected FCF level.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some near-term excitement</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, one of the main drivers of today's rally was probably the talk around the company's spectrum assets. Since Sirius XM (roughly speaking) owns about twice as much spectrum as it needs, there is a huge monetization opportunity. While an outright sale is complicated, probably not even smart to do (as it would create some technical and regulatory problems), the fastest way to make money from this asset is through third-party partnerships.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In recent months, management has repeatedly pointed to such opportunities during conference calls and investor conferences, and today's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835409-sirius-xm-holdings-inc-siri-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a> seemed to bring even greater intensity to this subject. It actually sounded like there is some concrete near-term opportunity in sight, with a potential announcement not too far away.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since nobody really knows how big such an announcement would be, which figures it would involve and how it would impact the stock's fundamentals, some short covering is probably the prudent thing to do.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Sirius XM's effective turnaround is still not there – the market would need to see increasing subscriber numbers for a couple of quarters – investors are probably seeing that subscriber dynamics are not the only and maybe not even the most important thing to watch here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I explained in my recent article on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4747848-sirius-xm-what-is-berkshires-endgame\">Berkshire's likely endgame</a>, if SIRI doesn't deteriorate <em>rapidly</em>, this investment can still deliver good results. It is a classic value investment: The spectrum assets, its real estate in most of the U.S. car fleet, its low-churn subscriber base, and, last but not least, its robust FCF generation coupled with buybacks can yield decent investment results even with a slowly declining subscriber base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most recent quarter has given some substance to that theory, and highlighted the possibility that (1) subscribers might even grow again, while (2) the company might surprise with some unexpected spectrum-related capital inflow and/or moat-enhancing partnership.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is why the stock rallied.</p>",

The US, the European Union and Japan eventually forced Beijing to overturn the measures via the World Trade Organisation. The incident spurred Japan’s efforts to reduce its reliance on China. Japan’s dependence on China’s rare earths dropped from around 90% at the time of the incident to around 60% today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This year saw a significant escalation of China’s rare earth restrictions as Beijing used its dominance over the critical materials to pressure the US administration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In April, in response to escalating trade tensions, including US tariffs, Beijing imposed export restrictions on seven rare earths and permanent magnets, with companies needing to secure special licenses to send these materials overseas. The curbs included some heavy rare earths, which are almost exclusively produced by China. This was the first time China has placed rare earth magnets on the export control list.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The global automotive industry was among the sectors <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4793763-china-export-restrictions-rare-earths-causes-alarm-automotive-industry\" rel=\"noopener\">significantly affected</a> by China’s export controls on rare earth magnets. Ford Motor temporarily shut a Chicago factory in May after running short of rare earth components. In the European Union, companies also reported several production stoppages.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then, October saw sweeping new restrictions with Beijing outlining plans to expand curbs, including requiring overseas exporters of items that contain even small amounts of certain rare earths sourced from China to have an export license. It also subjected technology and equipment related to rare earths processing and magnets to export controls. These measures will now be suspended for a year. The original restrictions announced in April, targeting seven heavy rare earths, weren’t addressed in the statement following this week's meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The US accounted for 10% of China’s total rare earth exports in 2024, but restrictions have led to a 12% drop in shipments to the US from the first to the third quarter of 2025.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">China total rare earth’s exports volume by region</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"744\" data-height=\"343\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png?io=w640\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"295\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618527899977312_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: China General Customs Administration, BNEF, ING Research</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Magnets drive China’s rare earths exports</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"744\" data-height=\"343\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"rare earths china\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"295\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-1761852798761349_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: China’s General Administration of Customs, ING Research</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">How will the US boost production of rare earths?</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MP Materials operates the only American rare earths mine – Mountain Pass in California’s Mojave Desert, reopened in 2018, and once the world’s top supplier before production shifted to China. It received a $400 million investment from the Pentagon in July, which helped the company fund a new magnets plant in a deal that came with guaranteed purchases at minimum prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trump is also looking beyond the US for rare earths supplies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earlier this month, the US and Australia agreed to jointly invest in Australian mines and processing projects. Both countries also pledged to protect their domestic markets from “unfair trade practices”, using trade measures like floor prices. Australia ranks fourth in rare earth reserves. Still, most projects are several years away from becoming operational.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The US President has also sealed a series of deals on his Asia trip to secure rare earth supplies, including deals with Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The deal with Japan involves the two sides agreeing to boost the supply and production of rare earths, including plans for coordinated investment and stockpiling of rare earths. Meanwhile, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia all agreed to increase US access to rare earths and export rules that would favour American buyers over Chinese companies. These include promises that they will not block shipments to the US. They would also encourage local processing and investment by non-Chinese firms.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These deals mark progress towards more diversified supply chains of rare earths, marking a shift in approach, increasing support and involvement from the state.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rising demand adds urgency</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The rise in demand from EVs, renewable energy, and defence adds urgency to the market. The International Energy Agency (IEA) projects strong growth in rare earth demand driven by clean energy technologies. EVs are expected to lead, with a compound annual growth rate of 17.2% from 2024 to 2030, followed by wind turbines at 7.5%. Overall, rare earth demand is forecast to grow at 5.1% annually during this period. Other end uses include defence, mobile phones, displays, medical imaging, speakers, headphones, control rods in nuclear reactors and catalysts.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rare earth demand is rising</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"744\" data-height=\"343\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"rare earth demand\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"295\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/60114626-17618528081097028_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: IEA, ING Research</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Loosening China’s grip on rare earths won’t be easy</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The deal between Trump and Xi should not give policymakers a false sense of security. Instead, it must serve as a reminder that the United States urgently needs to accelerate efforts to build a supply chain for critical minerals and magnets that does not depend on China. Beijing’s dominance means it can tighten export restrictions at any time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the near term, China will likely maintain its edge, thanks to technical expertise, low costs, and an extensive supply network. But rare earth supply chains must diversify. International cooperation and investment are essential first steps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Breaking Beijing’s grip on rare earths will be slow and expensive, but the payoff is strategic independence. Export controls that give China leverage today will ultimately spur global efforts to develop non-Chinese supply chains. The more the world invests in onshoring and alternative suppliers, the less control China will wield in the long run.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

After an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833039-molina-healthcare-looks-like-a-sick-puppy\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833039-molina-healthcare-looks-like-a-sick-puppy\" target=\"_blank\">increase in the MCR from competitor Molina Healthcare</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MOH\" title=\"Molina Healthcare, Inc.\">MOH</a>), this was encouraging.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, guidance was raised, with adjusted EPS guidance increased from $16 to $16.25, up about 1.5% from the Q2 guidance. Again, it's important to remember that UNH first withdrew guidance, then dramatically reduced their 2025 guidance. A nominal raise like this seems to me to be more of a sweetener for investors than a material upgrade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The earnings have been well covered by S.A. authors, with an overwhelming 'Buy' bias.

The assumption is that rates can be increased enough to restore historical margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I was hoping that United, as the market leader, would provide details of the pricing adjustments for 2026 that they have been able to achieve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There was a fair amount of discussion on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834045-unitedhealth-group-incorporated-unh-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834045-unitedhealth-group-incorporated-unh-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">the earnings call</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management discussed the process of rate increases segment by segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Medicare Advantage - cost inflation is trending at 7.5%, and is expected to trend to 10% in 2026. Other Medicare segments are viewed consistently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Commercial Insurance repricing is around 60% complete for 2026. Margins are expected to recover through 2026 with a return to historical margins only in 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ACA markets are more challenging. Rate re-filings are reported to exceed 25%, however these seem not to be broadly accepted by the states. In response, the company expects to reduce ACA membership by 2/3 of current levels, a massive market share reduction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Medicaid was left until last. Here only half of the rates to be effective January 1st have been agreed. Half remain open. United expects 2025 to be broadly breakeven for Medicaid, and 2026 to be negative by around 1.5%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of margin outlook, for the risk business, the target remains a return to 7-9% margins. However, expectations are that 2026 will miss the bottom end of that range by 1.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, a rational approach to setting medical cost inflation trends. The expectation however is for cost trends to increase up to 10% year on year, up from around 7.5%. That's a rapid pace of change with increasing momentum. I see a material risk that the trend could continue to accelerate, and the 10% undershoots. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Secondly, a big driver has been benefit utilisation levels. Management provided little insight into expectations here. My concern is that significant increases in pricing will drive away healthier members, who submit fewer claims, leaving the residual risk pool overweighted to the 'frequent flyers' who use benefits more. An increase in net utilisation levels could result in further pressure on the MCR even if rates can rise faster than medical inflation trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thirdly, pricing. Other than quoting a big number of 25% increases in rate <strong>re-filings </strong>there was little data available of the actual level of rate increases being achieved in the segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see a material risk to the margin expectations for 2026. The outlook for 2027 and beyond indicated reversion to historical margins, but any margin under-performance in 2026 is likely to flow into the outer years.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Optum</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Optum Health is undergoing a massive turnaround in the Value Based Care segment. Optum Rx CEO Patrick Conway was pretty straightforward in outlining the mistakes made here, which are all related to growing too aggressively. This stretched across the provider network and the product range offered, and the rapid growth created operational and integration issues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conway described a significant repositioning here, with a reduction of the partnership footprint to seek restored profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The application of a new risk scoring and payment regulatory mechanism called v28 caused significant margin erosion, and Optum is having to renegotiate partner contracts to mitigate this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The targets for margin improvement are significant. Current margins are expected to be under 3%, pulled down by value based care margins of less than 1%. Medicare funding cuts are identified as a headwind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The long term margin targets for the business are for margins to improve to 6-8%</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similarly, the fee based Optum business has been underperforming, and significant work is being done here to turn the business around.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A bright spot is in Optum Insights, where AI applications are hoped to generate significant future revenue streams and profitable growth. The company continues to invest here, but there were few concrete details of progress.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, Optum Rx, the PBM, has been performing well, with solid margins and growth. No mention was made of the<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doj-expands-probe-into-unitedhealths-prescription-management-services-bloomberg-2025-08-26/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doj-expands-probe-into-unitedhealths-prescription-management-services-bloomberg-2025-08-26/\" target=\"_blank\"> DOJ probe into Optum Rx billing</a> practices, which I found disappointing. This could have the potential to create headwinds for Optum Rx if the findings are negative, or create the need for changes in the operating model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The PBM sector has been the subject of criticism from the current administration, with President Trump referring to the sector as, \"The horrible middleman that makes more money, frankly, than the drug companies, and they don't do anything except they're a middleman,\" <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/insurer-stocks-fall-after-trump-says-were-going-knock-out-middleman-2024-12-16/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/insurer-stocks-fall-after-trump-says-were-going-knock-out-middleman-2024-12-16/\" target=\"_blank\">as reported by Reuters</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As <a href=\"https://pharmaphorum.com/news/pbm-reform-looms-end-year-us-legislation-package\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://pharmaphorum.com/news/pbm-reform-looms-end-year-us-legislation-package\" target=\"_blank\">this article from 'pharmaforum' discusses</a>, legislation targeting PBM margins is included in the upcoming legislative docket, drawing strong lobbying efforts from the PBM industry. The legislation seeks to squeeze margins by changing the rules on 'spread pricing' whereby PBMs add margins on drug costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are just a couple of examples of the pressure currently facing PBMs. However, there seems to be little discussion or awareness of the risk to growth and margins in the PBM sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, in one way or another, most of the segments of Optum are either managing turnarounds, or facing risks.

I rate UNH as a Hold.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my own portfolio, I took a long position around $300, hedging by selling OTM calls. My shares were called away for $330, for a total return of around 25% including call premiums. I am now short Nov 11th $320 puts. </p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a></span>) shares fell nearly 4% in extended trading after the company disclosed record capital expenditure of $35 billion in its fiscal first quarter, well above Wall Street expectations. Management warned that spending<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> would stay elevated through the year as it expands AI and cloud infrastructure.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the move underscores Microsoft’s long-term ambition to dominate artificial intelligence, investors reacted cautiously to the near-term cost pressure, highlighting the delicate balance between growth and profitability.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Technical setup signals pause after major rally</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The daily chart shows Microsoft consolidating after a sharp rally earlier this year that pushed shares to $554.83. The stock has now retraced toward the $541 zone, coinciding with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement and immediate resistance-turned-support. The 20-day EMA at $522.57 and 50-day EMA at $515.12 sit just below current levels, forming critical near-term floors. A decisive break under this cluster could expose the 100-day EMA at $500.47, while the 200-day EMA at $475.20 anchors the broader uptrend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1386\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"866\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_6903333a8619e.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Microsoft stock price dynamics (Source: TradingView)</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Price action remains within a rising channel structure, signaling that the long-term bullish pattern of higher highs and higher lows is intact. However, momentum indicators show early signs of fatigue. The RSI is hovering at 72, suggesting overbought conditions that often precede consolidation phases. Unless the stock reclaims $555 resistance and sustains above it, the probability of further sideways action or a mild pullback remains high.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Azure strength steadies investor confidence</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the headline spending shock, Azure cloud performance delivered an upside surprise. The division grew 40% year-over-year in the July–September quarter, beating estimates of 38.4%. The company guided for 37% growth in the current quarter, signaling sustained demand. CFO Amy Hood emphasized that capacity limitations had capped stronger growth, implying the elevated capital expenditure is aimed at eliminating those bottlenecks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The spending surge mirrors a broader pattern across Big Tech as firms race to expand AI infrastructure. Alphabet and Meta also warned of rising costs tied to data center buildouts and AI deployment. While these investments strengthen long-term competitive positions, they are likely to pressure margins through the near term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue guidance between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion for the current quarter met expectations, maintaining confidence in Microsoft’s ability to generate consistent top-line growth. Analysts note that the company’s diverse business lines — spanning Azure, Office 365, and gaming — continue to provide stability despite increased capital intensity.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook: Balancing cost and cloud growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For investors, the trade-off is clear: accept near-term margin compression in exchange for leadership in AI infrastructure. The chart structure suggests consolidation, with $515–$522 as the zone to watch for trend confirmation. Holding above this range keeps bullish bias intact, while a slip toward $500 could shift momentum defensively. On the upside, reclaiming $555 opens the door to a retest of the 1.618 Fibonacci extension near $593.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As previously discussed, Microsoft’s long-term thesis remains tied to its cloud and AI dominance. The short-term pressure on margins may weigh on sentiment, but as Azure growth accelerates and new AI tools gain traction, the <a href=\"https://tradersunion.com/news/financial-news/show/752700-microsoft-climbs-to-542/\" rel=\"nofollow\">company’s ability to balance cost discipline with innovation</a> will determine whether the recent pullback evolves into a buying opportunity or signals a deeper correction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>This material may contain third-party opinions; none of the data and information on this webpage constitutes investment advice according to our <a href=\"https://tradersunion.com/terms-of-use/#p10\" rel=\"nofollow\">Disclaimer</a>.

It’s major subsidiary, Lollicup USA Inc is a specialty distributor and manufacturer of single use disposable products mainly for the restaurant and foodservices industry. There are<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> several ‘sub-categories’ which encompass a wide range of products and services.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Karat is the major brand, and it provides high quality disposable food packaging, containers, tableware, cups, lids, cutlery, and straws.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Karat Earth takes Karat to the next level by focusing on eco-friendly products, allowing customers who are environmentally conscious to buy and use sustainable and recyclable or compostable products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tea Zone delivers premium tea and syrup solutions to the bubble tea industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Total Clean offers a full range of janitorial products as well as general and warehouse supplies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Why now</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A couple of years ago the company pivoted to a more asset light model which saw the majority of revenue shift from manufacturing to distribution. Low freight costs and competitively priced products were a great offset against high local costs (particularly labor).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Local Manufacturing then dropped from roughly 20% of sales to 11% currently, however they have maintained select US manufacturing capability to enable agility &amp; flexibility and to help with short lead times and urgent orders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As per a recent <a href=\"https://irkarat.com/download/krt-ir-presentation-september-2025/?wpdmdl=8935&amp;refresh=68ed11983b8851760367000\" rel=\"nofollow\">presentation in September 2025</a> ecofriendly products have risen to 33.6% of sales in 2024. This is the niche which the company is choosing to focus on, and I’d expect a lot of effort to be directed to these lines of business going forward. Tariffs have had a relatively benign impact on the business as their products are sourced from lower Tariff countries like <a href=\"https://www.theglobalstatistics.com/taiwan-tariffs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Taiwan</a> (tariff 10%) and <a href=\"https://www.theglobalstatistics.com/vietnam-tariffs-on-us-goods/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vietnam</a> (tariff 20%) with ‘just’ 10% of sourcing from China at the time of writing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616717275138972.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" width=\"576\" height=\"291\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"576\" data-height=\"291\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616717275138972.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616717275138972.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616717275138972.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616717275138972.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616717275138972.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616717275138972.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616717275138972.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616717275138972.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Global sourcing concentration <span>(Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This niche has some major tailwinds going for it, firstly Government is proposing via the <a href=\"https://www.recyclingtoday.com/news/senators-introduce-farewell-to-foam-act-expanded-polystyrene/\" rel=\"nofollow\">‘farewell to foam act’</a> to ban the use of Styrofoam on a phase out basis by 2028. (<a href=\"https://www.packagingdive.com/news/tracker-packaging-state-policy-epr-pcr-pfas-recyclability/647362/?policy-area=foam\" rel=\"nofollow\">11 states have pre-empted this by already issuing bans</a>). Another tailwind is the ongoing ESG drive by both corporates and consumers as ‘doing the right thing’ and a drive to a better, healthier more sustainable ‘lifestyle’ becomes more common place globally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.towardspackaging.com/insights/us-sustainable-packaging-market-sizing\" rel=\"nofollow\">According to ‘Towards Packaging’</a> the size of the sustainable packaging market is set to reach $73.81bn by 2034 in the USA, growing at a rate of 4.15% per annum with food and beverage expected to consume the largest share of the spend (41.4%). <a href=\"https://www.polarismarketresearch.com/press-releases/food-service-disposable-market\" rel=\"nofollow\">Polaris research</a> see the global food service disposables market growing at 4.6% annually to reach a value of $98.5bn by 2034.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Eco conscious consumers are choosing to support companies and brands which focus on this and its creating customer loyalty. A brand's product packaging is a competitive advantage too, it’s functional, key to maintaining freshness and appearance &amp; it’s a potential differentiator in a competitive market. The packaging itself can of course also be used for advertising and promotion. Some great companies are already using their products in the US FMCG space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616719722360666.png?io=w640\" alt=\"picture\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"521\" height=\"320\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616719722360666.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616719722360666.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616719722360666.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616719722360666.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616719722360666.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616719722360666.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616719722360666.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616719722360666.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Current FMCG clients <span>(Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Current FMCG clients <span>(Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The customer base has broadened too. ‘Pure’ distribution allows the company to serve national and regional peers.

These now account for 17% of Net Sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Flavors and syrups for the bubble tea market make up the balance at 4.9% of Net Sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This broad and diverse cohort of customers in varying industries has helped reduce concentration risk and now no single client accounts for more than 10% of revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Covid provided a boom for the industry with growth of around 40% in sales over the 2020-2022 period. Since then, however, it’s been fairly stagnant as pull forward demand has been absorbed by a normalized market, however I think we’re poised to see growth start picking up again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Being ‘on trend’ with the shift to clean and green, a new opportunity has opened up for the company and they have developed an important niche as a scaled leading player in the eco-friendly foodservice packaging space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By avoiding mass commodity supply and focusing on high mix, fast turnaround, branded and specialty packaging instead the company has managed to grind out ever better margins and earnings and even better they have gone from being cash flow negative as recently as 2021 to generating around $50m in free cash flow over the last 12 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another compelling point in my view is the fact that <a href=\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/KRT/holders/\" rel=\"nofollow\">insiders own a massive amount of stock,</a> in fact over 57% of the company sits with the founders and other staff. This is true alignment in my book. There is an incentive to grow the business over time, to keep paying a hefty dividend and to ensure that wealth is protected. As shareholders, I’d like to think that our interests would be aligned with those of the founders who in turn would manage their (and our wealth) with care and integrity. On top of this both founders earn very modest salaries and no additional stock options as part of their compensation structure. This probably explains why such a large dividend is paid and is certainly further incentive to increase profits to increase the company’s value and future dividend pay outs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Packaging has always been fiercely competitive with a slew of companies fighting for share in what is generally a slow-growing low-margin market. This is why it’s important to try and disrupt or shake the market up if you’re small and up and coming. By using new technologies and being nimble smaller players can pivot quickly to changing circumstances and market dynamics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is where the eco-friendly, higher margin, niche stands to shine. These products made up about a third of net sales last year and the company sees further room for expansion and growth. This is primarily because of two levers, firstly a small starting base and secondly as alluded to above, government mandates that propose to ban certain materials that have been commonly used in the past. The company aims to fill gaps in product lines to get restaurant and food service customers what they need, quickly and efficiently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">No matter who you consider as a competitor KRT is small. With Revenue of $ 422.6m in 2024 and a market cap of $ 500m this is not a large company. However, therein lies the opportunity in my view. Karat is still ‘young’ with a lot of growth potential ahead of it, here’s my thinking:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consensus forecasts through 2027 are calling for Revenue growth of roughly 8% per annum with EPS growth of 12%. Against market growth of 4% this is telling me they’re slowly gaining share and with sales of $422m (in a market forecast to be worth around $74bn in 2034) there is a lot of share to be had. Just a 1% market share implies sales of $740m and 75% growth from here for example.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>VALUATION</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at it from a DCF perspective. Extrapolating 12% earnings growth over the next three years (these are consensus numbers) and then dropping them down to 4% after that to line the company up with market growth of 4.15% (the Towards Packaging figure above) would imply that they gain a small amount of market share up until 2027 and then stagnate after that. Using the average return of the S&amp;P500 over the long term (10%) as the discount rate, we get a fair value of $31.90.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616724946007597.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" width=\"559\" height=\"229\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"559\" data-height=\"229\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616724946007597.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616724946007597.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616724946007597.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616724946007597.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616724946007597.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616724946007597.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616724946007597.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/18013272-17616724946007597.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

Compared to a current share price of $24.59 this would imply upside up to $31.00 or 26%. With a current dividend yield of 7.3% your total return potential could be in the 30's.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>RISKS</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As with any investment there are always risks to consider. Over and above the normal market and economic risk that any company faces daily, one also needs to consider the fact that this is a small company, it competes in a low moat, low cost and very competitive industry. The restaurant industry in particular is cut throat and cost conscious. Packaging is a commodity and unless you can demonstrate real value add, lowest price wins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Large founder skin in the game is always a big positive in my world, however in this instance the ownership structure is arguably more complex than it needs to be. There are also several related party transactions that could make some potential investors uncomfortable. For example, the CEO’s brother owns one of the companies’ overseas suppliers and roughly 13% of products sold came from this company. <a href=\"https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=103398&amp;ref=318164706&amp;type=HTML&amp;symbol=KRT&amp;cdn=404900988e3420650206b3ad201fbbcb&amp;companyName=Karat+Packaging+Inc.&amp;formType=10-K&amp;formDescription=Annual+report+pursuant+to+Section+13+or+15%28d%29&amp;dateFiled=2024-03-15#i5c1df8fc06cf4cb8bdaa9b0ee5d4e94b_181\" rel=\"nofollow\">(page 68, point 17 of the 10-k</a>)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the dividend, last year they paid more than they earned with the difference supported by free cash flow. This is unsustainable and not what I like to see. Slow or no dividend growth is therefore possible going forward as they grow into the dividend. I see a lower dividend as unlikely unless forced as founder compensation is closely tied to it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sometimes solid investment opportunities come in different guises. Most of us look for glamourous industries and companies where most of the buzz is. Today for example its things like AI, reshoring and energy transition with others like obesity drugs and crypto still up there and top of mind for many.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But what if you took a few steps to the left or right of these themes and looked for companies that help facilitate these trends and provide solutions for customers at the same time? Oftentimes those sweet spots are ignored or not even considered because they’re so ‘unromantic’ or not in vogue. Rarely for example will you see a social media influencer touting the need for a good plumber or high-quality toilet paper. Nobody cares until you need it right!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion Karat packaging fits into this mold. It provides essential and needed products to its customers and its customers’ customers, helping them meet their needs in a green and eco friendly manner.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I bet you’ve never really thought about how your takeaway meal is packaged or presented to you. As long as it arrives on time and looks appealing you’re happy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We all (myself included) take for granted the ‘other’ things that restaurants of all sizes provide whether you eat in or take out. Napkins, straws, take out containers, cups and even cutlery are items that are just ‘there’ yet without them our meal experience would just not be the same.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Being ‘on trend’ with the shift to clean and green, a new opportunity has opened up for the company and they have developed an important niche as a leading player in the eco-friendly foodservice packaging space which I think deserves an investment.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With potential returns in the 30% range, this stock is finding a place in my growth portfolio with a modest allocation to begin with. I rate Karat Packaging (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KRT\" title=\"Karat Packaging Inc.\">KRT</a>) as a Buy for more risk tolerant investors.</p>",

What is more, while the ETF invests in some 653 individual companies, exposure to the top two holdings alone accounts for 21.16% of ETF assets:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1282\" data-height=\"628\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Ten largest individual holdings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"314\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618133705607748_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Ten largest individual holdings <span>(iShares website (accessed October 2025))</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, investors looking to save on fees may consider the rationale of investing directly in the two largest holdings - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>) and Samsung Electronics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\" target=\"_blank\">OTCPK:SSNLF</a>).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I estimate EMXC holdings currently trade at 18.45x their trailing P/E multiple, or an earnings yield of about 5.42%. Given the elevated information technology allocation, I view EMXC as quite comparable to the S&amp;P 500, notwithstanding a smaller financial sector allocation in the leading U.S. benchmark.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I calculate that the S&amp;P 500 currently trades at <a href=\"https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy\" target=\"_blank\">29.1x its trailing earnings</a>, or an earnings yield of 3.44%. Hence we can say that the current valuation suggests that S&amp;P 500 earnings would have to grow almost 2% faster in perpetuity just to make up for higher starting valuations relative to EMXC, something I see as unsustainable over the long term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">GDP Growth Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While GDP growth is an imperfect proxy for earnings growth, for ETFs with a diverse country allocation I find GDP growth to be a good starting point when evaluating future earnings growth prospects. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the table below, I have estimated the country-weighted EMXC GDP growth outlook for 2026 using the IMF's <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/10/14/world-economic-outlook-october-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2025/10/14/world-economic-outlook-october-2025\" target=\"_blank\">October 2025 World Economic Outlook</a>:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td>Country</td> <td>Weight</td> <td>GDP growth 2026</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Taiwan</td> <td>28.76%</td> <td>2.1%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>India</td> <td>21.77%</td> <td>6.2%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>South Korea</td> <td>17.32%</td> <td>1.8%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Brazil</td> <td>5.84%</td> <td>1.9%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>South Africa</td> <td>4.83%</td> <td>1.2%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Saudi Arabia</td> <td>4.50%</td> <td>4%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mexico</td> <td>2.70%</td> <td>1.5%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>United Arab Emirates</td> <td>2.07%</td> <td>5%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Malaysia</td> <td>1.61%</td> <td>4%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Indonesia</td> <td>1.57%</td> <td>4.9%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Poland</td> <td>1.48%</td> <td>3.1%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Thailand</td> <td>1.44%</td> <td>1.6%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Other/cash</td> <td>6.13%</td> <td>Not relevant</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Total</strong></td> <td><strong>100%</strong></td> <td><strong>3.16%</strong></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: Author calculations</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My calculations show that country-weighted GDP growth for EMXC should amount to about 3.16% in 2026, with the ETF benefiting from its large allocation to India which is forecast to deliver GDP growth of 6.2% next year. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The IMF projects U.S. GDP growth at 2.1% next year, roughly 1% below my weighted average estimate for EMXC. As such, while it is always possible that earnings growth deviates somewhat from GDP growth, I think that EMXC will deliver earnings growth at least on par, if not better, than the S&amp;P 500.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend Appeal</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EMXC offers a current dividend yield of 2.36%, indicating a payout ratio of about 0.48 when we factor in the ETF's expense ratio of 0.25%. As such, I view the current dividend as sustainable, with my estimates showing that dividends should increase by 7-8% in 2026, marginally below the 9.88% annual increase over the past three years:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618172524630544.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EMXC dividend grade\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"475\" height=\"256\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618172524630544.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618172524630544.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618172524630544.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618172524630544.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618172524630544.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618172524630544.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618172524630544.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/44733396-17618172524630544.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EMXC dividend grade <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My dividend growth outlook is driven by retained earnings, solid GDP growth, and inflation somewhat above 2% in emerging markets. Amid ongoing Fed rate cuts, I view EMXC as an ideal ETF for investors focused on dividend growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">EMXC Rating</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even after the strong year-to-date outperformance, EMXC holdings offer a trailing earnings yield some 2% higher than the S&amp;P 500. GDP growth projections for 2026 remain favorable, with EMXC countries likely to deliver GDP growth roughly 1% stronger than the United States.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As discussed in the <em>Dividend Appeal</em> section, the ETF also offers a dividend yield that is double that of the cheapest S&amp;P 500-tracking options such as the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VOO\" title=\"Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF\">VOO</a>), with VOO currently offering a paltry 1.11% dividend yield. I also believe that EMXC dividend growth will exceed that of the S&amp;P 500 going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, I think that EMXC will continue to outperform the S&amp;P 500 in 2026, ranking the ETF with a Buy rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investing in emerging markets comes with elevated risks compared to the more established U.S. capital market. Firstly, while EMXC is traded in USD, it represents an implicit short USD bet since the ETF invests in companies traded in local currencies such as the Taiwan dollar and Indian rupee. As such, investors not comfortable with currency risk should avoid emerging market ETFs such as EMXC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Secondly, there is no guarantee that strong GDP growth will translate into robust earnings growth for EMXC holdings. For emerging markets, the link between GDP growth and corporate earnings growth may not be as strong, since capital markets are not as developed as those in the United States.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last but certainly not least in terms of importance, with 35.12% of ETF assets allocated to the information technology sector, EMXC is particularly exposed to the risk of AI/automation growth falling short of expectations. Likewise the ETF's 45.11% allocation to cyclical sectors exposes EMXC to losses should GDP growth fall short of expectations.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China tariff tensions have been a key point of contention so far in 2025, culminating in the April 2025 market selloff. While recent headlines suggest the risk of a full-blown trade war is receding, the rivalry between the United States and China will likely be a defining feature this century as the two super powers battle for influence in economic affairs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Against this backdrop, investors can mitigate China-related risks and at the same time benefit from superb emerging markets growth by investing in EMXC. The ETF's holdings currently offer an earnings yield some 2% higher than the S&amp;P 500, while GDP growth is likely to be roughly 1% higher than that of the United States.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Coupled with a higher dividend yield and better dividend growth prospects, I believe this should result in continued outperformance of EMXC relative to the S&amp;P 500 in 2026, ranking EMXC a Buy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key risks in the investment case include currency risk, the imperfect link between GDP expansion and earnings growth, and the ETF's outsized exposure to cyclical sectors and the AI/automation growth theme.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thank you for reading.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
