Joining us now to discuss, Andrew Kelvin, Managing Director and Head of Canadian and Global Rates Strategy at TD Securities.</p> <p>Great to have you back on the program.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> Thank you for having me.</p> <p><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> Strong indication here. I know this was the call from TD Securities heading into this. We get a 25 basis point cut, and that's it. That's the end. They've hit their terminal rate, he's indicating pretty strongly there. What would it take to move them off that sideline?</p> <p><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> Yeah, I will say I was a little bit surprised they were as explicit as they were about expecting that they were done with this easing cycle at this level. I would have thought they would have been a little bit more cagey about it, maybe preserve a little bit more optionality for future meetings. But I think the fact that they were so transparent about how they're viewing the future policy path tells you that there's a very, very high bar for them to cut rates again in December. Presumably, this has some sort of relationship to the upcoming federal budget, which is expected broadly to be stimulative. And it would make sense if you're the central bank to not be easing immediately after a rather stimulative budget.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, in order to get them off of this hold that they've sort of communicated they're in, the answer is really simple. The governor was saying that if conditions change, they will reevaluate their path, which is what you would both hope and expect. December, I feel pretty comfortable with the idea that December is a hold. They would not have been as explicit in their communication if they thought there was a reasonable chance of a December cut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And again, it has that sort of proximity to the budget. Even January, it's not clear to me that we're going to have a good indication as to what the stimulative impacts of that budget will be. If the economy is flagging a little bit in January, we will still have the potential boost coming from announced stimulus into 2026 to comfort policymakers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But if we get into the spring-- so I'm really looking at March, April, June meetings-- and growth is not above its trend rate, if we're still seeing excess capacity in the economy grow, at that point the Bank of Canada, I think, will have to reconsider if this is, in fact, the floor for interest rates in this cycle. And if it turns out that the drag on the economy from the trade dispute with the United States is a little bit worse, if trading conditions with the United States become worse than they are today, that would be something that would cause them to reconsider.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And when I say worse than they are today, I'm not talking about just that sort of presumptive 10% additional reciprocal tariff. I'm talking about something that's more broadly punitive for a wider swath of the Canadian economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> Seem to be in a bit of a tough place because they are recognizing, of course, that they can't solve a trade war just through monetary policy. But sometimes a trade war can send prices higher, but a weaker economy, they think all of that weighs out, keeps prices in check. Are they being a little too optimistic on inflation being contained, considering everything we're facing?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> The reason-- I think it's actually a very reasonable set of forecasts they have. And I would say that on both the growth and inflation side. We can't solve a change in our trading relationship with monetary policy. What monetary policy can do is smooth that adjustment. It can make that adjustment less painful, which is why these sorts of moves are appropriate in my mind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of how inflation is going forward, I think the reason why I'm pretty comfortable with the idea inflation will be contained around 2%-- I never want to put a firm 2.0, so somebody can point their finger at me and say I'm wrong if it's 2.1.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To me, a perhaps overlooked thing in the structural change the Canadian economy is going under right now is the change in population growth. We had obviously very strong population growth in recent years, which is one of the factors that helped contribute to rising rents, rising shelter prices broadly. If we are going to remain in an environment where population growth is very, very weak, close to 0, we shouldn't have those same upward pressures on shelter prices. We shouldn't have those same upward pressures on rents.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And shelter's a huge part of the CPI basket. So if we're going to be in an environment where population growth is very weak, that should prevent runaway shelter price inflation. And that in and of itself should be enough to keep inflation around 2%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> Now, you mentioned the structural changes that we're undergoing because of the trade tensions and how the relationship is probably not going to be the same going forward. Well, it's not the same right now with the US. Governor Macklem mentioned it as well. Once we get through these structural changes, what does our economy look like on the other side?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> So it's probably an economy where the level of activity in the economy is just lower than it otherwise would have been. The way I tend to think about these things is you have a drag on growth in year 1 and 2. And even if you see growth return to its previous levels, you still have this sort of permanent gap between where the level of activity could have been and where you are now. And additionally, they did highlight that they look at these changing trade relationships as something that will drag on potential GDP. So having weaker terms of-- weaker trading conditions, weaker ability to trade with the US, less open market access is something that will drag potentially permanently on Canadian growth in their mind.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So they see us transitioning to a lower-growth economy due to the fact that we will have less open trading conditions with the US going forward, just assuming that the current conditions move forward. If we are able to strike some sort of a grand bargain and go back to the world the way it was, in November, just in terms of what the actual tariffs charged are, what the actual market access is, obviously, a lot of that drag sort of disappears, and we can return to that previous economic trajectory.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One point I would just make, though, is one of the values of a trade deal is it provides certainty. Businesses can look at the trade deal, trust that the terms of market access will remain constant, and make investments and decisions with the long term in mind. Going forward, even if we get a deal in the next day, week, month, quarter, year, whatever--</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> We had a deal under the first Trump administration, right?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> So yeah, pick your time horizon. I don't think people will be quite as willing to just accept that this will be a long-term deal, which they were in the first USMCA. I think when the first USMCA was signed, people had assumed that that deal would hold. And I'm quite certain-- I probably came on your show and said in 2024, I was like, well, Donald Trump signed USMCA one, so surely he won't tear it up. And then fast forward to today and he has largely moved away from that deal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So it is something where we probably never fully unring that bell. It probably does speak to an economy where, absent other positive developments, we're in a bit more of a slow-growth environment, which is probably why you see the federal government so focused on taking measures to boost productivity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> Talk about that. I mean, that puts a lot of pressure on next week's federal budget, doesn't it, to show us something that this economy needs? What do we need to see from that budget?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> The budget is probably having too much asked of it at this point. The federal government is in a fairly enviable position, just in that 15 to 20 years of reasonably responsible fiscal policy in Canada. I mean that the governments over in the post-pandemic era have had a lot of fiscal room. Our net federal debt to GDP is quite low. So this government can come out with a 2, 2.5% budget deficit as a share of GDP without really roiling markets. And I think markets are quite positioned for what could be quite a large deficit in this upcoming budget.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problem I think the government faces here is that a lot of the measures that they would like to take to boost productivity-- cutting red tape. Their first bill, the first signature bill they passed when they came into parliament before the summer recess was about streamlining projects of national importance. And that's all well and good, cutting red tape is all-- I've never heard an argument for red tape. I'm sure it exists, but no one's ever said it to me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That sort of effort is the sort of thing that can pay dividends down the road. Cutting approval timelines to make sure that shovels can be in the ground within two years or five years, or whatever the timeframe is is a great thing that can help boost productivity and growth once those shovels start hitting the ground and once the project's complete, whether it's a mine, a port expansion, a nuclear plant, what have you. The problem is, I don't see how any of these things are terribly helpful in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So I think the real task for this budget is they have to balance three things. They have to balance setting the stage to actually boost future productivity growth. They need to take some measures to fill the gap in aggregate demand that is going to persist into 2026, because I think if the government comes out and their entire budget is focused around measures to boost activity four, five, six years down the line-- again, thinking long term is great, but it doesn't help the economy in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Greg Bonnell:</strong> You want to see something right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Andrew Kelvin:</strong> So they'll need something to help bridge that gap between when these long-term capital investments start to produce growth and the trouble the economy is facing in adjusting right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And the third thing they'll need to do is probably follow through a little bit on some of the \"spend less\" parts of their slogan. They have talked about cutting the size of the civil service, reducing operating costs, whether it be through more use of technology or reducing consultants, whatever the mode they do is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They have to balance all these three things, and they don't all pull in the same direction. There's a balance between whether to invest for the long term or the short term. Do want to spend for the long term or the short term? How much new spending do you want to have that is effectively offset by operating cost reductions? Because there is no free cost cutting. Anytime you reduce operating costs for a government, that does have negative implications for the economy. Maybe it's not one for one. There is no pure dead weight that can just be cut here.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.moneytalkgo.com/video/boc-signals-its-rate-cut-cycle-may-be-finished/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p>",

The pace is above Hershey’s 4.7% revenue CAGR from 2002 to 2024; considering surging cocoa prices that have continued to weaken demand for chocolate, the performance is extremely good.

The performance reflects an approximated 7% increase in pricing as Hershey has raised prices to account for cocoa inflation, only slightly offset by a small -1% decline in sales volume.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the decline, the segment’s sales volume performance is very strong in my opinion – I also <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834762-mondelez-focusing-on-cocoa-deflation-after-weak-q3-rating-upgrade\">covered</a> Mondelez International, Inc.'s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDLZ\" title=\"Mondelez International, Inc.\">MDLZ</a>) Q3 results, noting a much more significant -4.6% sales volume decline for the competitor. Mondelez noted higher than expected demand elasticity in the face of price increases, but Hershey’s demand has remained very resilient despite similar pricing actions. Hershey noted a more than 10 basis point retail market share gain in <a href=\"https://hershey.gcs-web.com/static-files/cc69098f-155b-4ecd-827b-6d4a9850e4e5\" rel=\"nofollow\">prepared remarks</a> with strength in the Jolly Rancher, Hershey, Cadbury, and Reese’s brands. Product innovation has driven strong retail-level sales, highlighting Hershey's strong brand portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">North America Salty Snacks also had a strong performance; the segment’s sales grew by 10.0% to $321 million, reflecting a massive 11 percentage point sales volume gain. Hershey’s promotional timing, media investments, and product innovation drove the segment’s good performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hershey's revenues also performed well in other markets; the International segment showed 12.1% revenue growth to $245 million, reflecting a 7% pricing increase and 6% growth in sales volume. Shipment timings in Europe and Mexico did contribute a part of the good volume gain as shipments moved from Q4 to Q3; underlying consumption seems to still have been subdued due to demand elasticity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hershey does note that the company has had a disappointing early Halloween performance, related by the company to warmer weather and seasonality effects. The overall sales signal from the Q3 report was still strong; on top of a strong Q3 across segments, Hershey raised the 2025 sales growth outlook to 3% from <em>at least 2%</em> previously.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margins Have Been a Compromise</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hershey’s margins suffered massively in Q3 due to significantly higher cocoa prices – profitability has been a clear compromise as the industry’s pricing power is clearly limited in the face of demand elasticity. The adjusted gross margin showed an 850 basis point decline to 31.8%, reflecting a mix of higher cocoa prices and tariffs. Higher input costs were not even nearly offset by Hershey’s price actions. Mondelez did show an even more significant 1010 basis point gross margin drop in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike Mondelez, though, Hershey didn’t manage SG&amp;A as prudently – Hershey’s operating expenses grew by 1.5% year-on-year. Adjusted operating income ended up declining by -35.4% to $423 million. The quarter’s $1.30 adjusted EPS still beat Wall Street’s consensus by $0.24 due to already subdued expectations in the current inflationary operating environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability issues shift the focus to cocoa deflation. As I also wrote in my article on Mondelez, cocoa prices have started to fall back due to improved crops. Cocoa futures stand at $6000 per tonne at the time of writing, at less than half the December 2024 peak.

Operating margins should be relatively flat year-over-year and down sequentially, aligned with historic seasonality.</p> <p>Source: MSFT Q1 2026 Earnings Transcript</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the Q1 report falls in the category of better-than-anticipated, and the initial negative share price reaction is likely linked to one of the issues that was highlighted a few months ago, namely the beginning of the market to price-in flat operating margins going forward. In spite of all the good news around MSFT in recent months, this is also the reason why the share price remained flat over the past three months as the Nasdaq Composite Index skyrocketed by 16%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Big Picture</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nothing has changed over the past few months, and I retain my Hold rating on MSFT due to the issues mentioned in my last analysis. Although the Q1 report was quite good, I anticipate a muted share price reaction to other such earnings releases in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, long-term investors who are willing to forego short-term underperformance and retain a long position in the company should do their best not to miss the forest for the trees. In other words, quarterly numbers could go in either direction in relation to the short-term analysts' estimates, but what truly matters for MSFT now is to remain positioned as a leader in generative AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, the section about OpenAI in each earnings release is becoming increasingly important. In the latest report, it was the details given about the new agreement with OpenAI as it undergoes a very important restructuring process.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the AI landscape evolves, OpenAI and Microsoft needed to alter their existing relationship in order for each one of them to achieve more freedom in certain areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a nutshell, there are two entities: a non-profit one called OpenAI Foundation and a for-profit organization called OpenAI Group PBC. MSFT holds a stake in the latter, which is <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/next-chapter-of-microsoft-openai-partnership/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://openai.com/index/next-chapter-of-microsoft-openai-partnership/\" target=\"_blank\">valued</a> at $135bn. According to MSFT management, the company has already 10x-ed their investments made in the company since 2019.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the value of MSFT's stake is bound to continue increasing, there have been a number of announcements made regarding the relationship.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Firstly, MSFT would continue to have exclusive IP rights and Azure exclusivity on API (Application Programming Interface) products, and OpenAI has committed to an incremental $250bn investment in Azure services. The new structure also gives MSFT rights to OpenAI's IP and models through 2032 or once an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is declared and verified by an expert panel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Secondly, MSFT can now pursue AGI on its own or with third parties, and the same goes for some products developed by OpenAI. For non-API products, OpenAI will be free to use any other cloud provider as it sees fit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, this new organization gives OpenAI some freedom to more easily raise capital and pursue an IPO in the coming years.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w640\" alt=\"OpenAI upcoming IPO\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"619\" height=\"148\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/13396702-17618277528449402.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although ChatGPT is still leading by a very wide margin in terms of market share, the competition within the AI-powered products will intensify significantly in the coming years, with all major players announcing significant <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510958-alphabet-signals-91b-93b-2025-capex-amid-ai-driven-growth-surge\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510958-alphabet-signals-91b-93b-2025-capex-amid-ai-driven-growth-surge\" target=\"_blank\">increases</a> in investments. Thus, the deal with OpenAI could give MSFT a much-needed freedom in further developing its own frontier models. It also opens up the space for other cloud infrastructure vendors to contract workloads from OpenAI.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Microsoft remains one of my favorite picks within the cloud and software sector, alongside my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821698-oracle-blockbuster-earnings-separating-the-business-from-the-stock-price\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821698-oracle-blockbuster-earnings-separating-the-business-from-the-stock-price\" target=\"_blank\">long-time favorite</a>—Oracle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>). Having said that, recent events confirm my fears that the share price does not offer much upside in the near term as investor expectations have already priced-in much of the business momentum. More importantly, however, the latest earnings release shows that quarterly figures are far less relevant for Microsoft's future than the company's strategic positioning in generative AI.</p>",

A favorable backdrop of positive global growth, falling interest rates across the developed markets, and a lack of pronounced negative<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> news fueled a surge in investors’ appetite for risk. Most notably, the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) cut rates by a quarter point in September, and the markets anticipated that additional easing could be in store over the months ahead.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors were further cheered by positive corporate earnings reports and the relatively limited initial economic impact from tariffs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These developments helped propel major equity indexes to a series of all-time highs. The United States led the way higher behind renewed enthusiasm about the artificial intelligence theme and the technology sector more broadly. Small- cap stocks, which benefited from the improving interest rate outlook and investors’ preference for risk, performed particularly well. The emerging markets were another top performer, with China registering an impressive gain amid revived optimism about the country’s economic outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The global fixed-income markets also produced positive returns, reflecting the increasingly favorable shift in Fed policy. Longer-term debt and credit-oriented categories generally provided the best results.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Contributors and detractors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Asset allocation was a slight detractor from the fund’s relative performance in the quarter. An underweight in U.S. large-cap stocks and corresponding overweights in defensive equities, mid caps, and the international markets were the primary drivers of the modest shortfall. On the other hand, an overweight in stocks and underweight in bonds positioned the fund to capitalize on the favorable market environment. Diversification into a real assets portfolio—which was helped by its position in metals and mining stocks—also contributed to performance. An overweight in emerging-market bonds in the fixed-income portfolio was a further positive.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Portfolio changes</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment conditions remained broadly positive at the close of the period, highlighted by ongoing optimism related to economic conditions and global central bank policy. However, valuations have become fairly full across many areas of the equity and fixed-income markets. With this in mind, we maintain a diversified portfolio designed to hold up through a wide range of possible outcomes. We think it’s better to keep a long-term view rather than trying to chase returns in specific categories. We believe this approach should hold the fund in good stead over time, and we think its merits may become increasingly apparent if the market backdrop becomes less favorable than investors are anticipating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Average annual total returns<sup>1,2,3 %</sup> </h2> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Qtd</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Ytd</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>1 yr</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>3 yr</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>5 yr</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>10 yr</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Since inception</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Inception date</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Class R6 without sales charge 4.39</p></td> <td><p>11.20</p></td> <td><p>8.56</p></td> <td><p>13.03</p></td> <td><p>7.12</p></td> <td><p>7.88</p></td> <td><p>7.03</p></td> <td><p>11/7/13</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Class R4 without sales charge 4.39</p></td> <td><p>11.02</p></td> <td><p>8.31</p></td> <td><p>12.73</p></td> <td><p>6.85</p></td> <td><p>7.66</p></td> <td><p>6.81</p></td> <td><p>11/7/13</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>S&amp;P Target Date 2025 Index 4.54</p></td> <td><p>11.64</p></td> <td><p>9.41</p></td> <td><p>13.31</p></td> <td><p>7.47</p></td> <td><p>7.66</p></td> <td><p>6.80</p></td> <td><p>—</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>John Hancock 2025 Lifetime 4.98</p></td> <td><p>11.98</p></td> <td><p>8.57</p></td> <td><p>13.41</p></td> <td><p>7.38</p></td> <td><p>8.57</p></td> <td><p>7.69</p></td> <td><p>—</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Target-date 2025 category 4.28</p></td> <td><p>8.91</p></td> <td><p>6.58</p></td> <td><p>11.93</p></td> <td><p>6.05</p></td> <td><p>6.83</p></td> <td><p>—</p></td> <td><p>—</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Expense</strong><strong>ratios</strong>4</p></td> <td><p><strong>Gross</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Net </strong><strong>(what </strong><strong>you</strong><strong> pay)</strong></p></td> <td> <p><strong>Contractual</strong></p> <p><strong>through</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Class R6</p></td> <td><p>0.70%</p></td> <td><p>0.35%</p></td> <td><p>12/31/2025</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Class R4</p></td> <td><p>1.05%</p></td> <td><p>0.60%</p></td> <td><p>12/31/2025</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td>The performance data shown represents past performance, which does not guarantee future results.

The portfolio is subject to the same risks as the underlying funds and exchange-traded funds in which it invests: Stocks and bonds can decline due to adverse issuer, market, regulatory, or economic developments; foreign investing, especially in emerging markets, has additional risks, such as currency and market volatility and political and social instability; the securities of small companies are subject to higher volatility than those of larger, more established companies; and high-yield bonds are subject to additional risks, such as increased risk of default. Each portfolio’s name refers to the approximate retirement year of the investors for whom the portfolio’s asset allocation strategy is designed. The portfolios with dates further off initially allocate more aggressively to stock funds. As a portfolio approaches and passes its target date, the allocation will gradually migrate to more conservative, fixed-income funds. The principal value of each portfolio is not guaranteed, and you could lose money at any time, including at, or after, the target date. Liquidity—the extent to which a security may be sold or a derivative position closed without negatively affecting its market value, if at all—may be impaired by reduced trading volume, heightened volatility, rising interest rates, and other market conditions. Hedging and other strategic transactions may increase volatility and result in losses if not successful. Please see the portfolio’s prospectus for additional risks.</em></p> <p><strong>The </strong><strong>S&amp;P </strong><strong>Target </strong><strong>Date </strong><strong>2025 </strong><strong>Index </strong>represents a broadly derived consensus of asset class exposure and glide path for target-date year 2025.

One of the primary ingredients of the AI economy is technologies that lie at the very nucleus of data transfer, namely connective tech, including solutions for the 5G and 6G networks. And for investors who would like to get exposure to the theme, there are a few vehicles to consider, including the Defiance Connective Technologies ETF (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SIXG\" title=\"Defiance Connective Technologies ETF\">SIXG</a></span>), a passively managed exchange-traded fund that we will be discussing today.</p> <h2 id=\"basics-of-the-defiance-connective-technologies-etf\">Basics Of The Defiance Connective Technologies ETF</h2> <ul> <li>SIXG is a passively managed ETF with an inception date of March 4, 2019.</li> <li>The ETF represents the Technology subclass of the Sector Equity class.</li> <li>Defiance ETFs, LLC is the investment adviser, while Penserra Capital Management LLC is the sub-adviser.</li> <li>As of October 29, 2025, SIXG's assets under management were at $695.36 million, which is almost 5.4x the median AUM for the subclass.</li> <li>SIXG's expense ratio is 0.30%, which is notably below the median ER for the subclass of 0.55%.</li> </ul> <h2 id=\"what-does-sixg-do\">What Does SIXG Do?</h2> <p>As we know from the factsheet available on the Defiance ETFs <a href=\"https://www.defianceetfs.com/sixg/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.defianceetfs.com/sixg/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, SIXG is a thematic, passively managed vehicle offering exposure to \"connective technology enablers crucial to the AI revolution,\" namely, to the 5G and 6G tech that</p> <blockquote><p>...provide the infrastructure needed for AI applications that demand high-speed connectivity, low latency, and massive data processing capabilities.</p></blockquote> <p>Importantly, established in March 2019, SIXG underwent changes in 2024.</p> <ul> <li>First, before July 22, 2024, SIXG <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/defiance-announces-name-and-ticker-symbol-change-fivg-sixg-defiance-connective\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/defiance-announces-name-and-ticker-symbol-change-fivg-sixg-defiance-connective\" target=\"_blank\">was known as</a> the Defiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF and had a ticker FIVG.</li> <li>Second, on September 23, 2024, SIXG started tracking the BlueStar® Connective Technologies Index that replaced the BlueStar 5G Communications Index. The changes were <a href=\"https://www.marketvector.com/insights/index-updates/rule-name-ticker-changes-of-bfivg\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://www.marketvector.com/insights/index-updates/rule-name-ticker-changes-of-bfivg\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> by MarketVector <span id=\"jS$308\" class=\"j3\">Indexes</span> in July 2024.</li> </ul> <p>As explained on page 14 of the prospectus:</p> <blockquote><p>Effective September 23, 2024, the Fund’s investment objective changed to track the performance, before fees and expenses, of the BlueStar® Connective Technologies Index. Prior to September 23, 2024, the Fund’s investment objective was to track the total return performance, before fees and expenses, of the BlueStar 5G Communications Index. Performance shown for periods prior to September 23, 2024, is that of the BlueStar 5G Communications Index.</p></blockquote> <h3 id=\"-\"> </h3> <p>In essence, as we can see in the old and new index universe rules comparison in the press release, while these indices have quite a lot in common, the key differences are that the connective tech index also includes companies involved with \"the rollout of 5G, or 6G networks,\" while the previous one was focused on the 5G networks only. Plus, \"satellite-based internet technology/providers\" was added to the universe.</p> <p>Still, investors should understand that although the indices have rather similar premises, the performance that SIXG delivered prior to the strategy change, though certainly of use and not to be ignored, should be treated with caution, as it is not necessarily indicative of the ETF's potential.</p> <p>For context, my calculations show that the SIXG portfolio as of October 27, 2025, has just a 68.8% overlap with the FIVG portfolio <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4547652-fivg-etf-has-5g-theme-become-cheap-enough\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4547652-fivg-etf-has-5g-theme-become-cheap-enough\" target=\"_blank\">as of October 18</a>, 2022. Moreover, it is quite notable that the basket became substantially leaner, with 50 equities vs. 86 as of October 2022.</p> <h2 id=\"how-is-the-index-calibrated\">How Is The Index Calibrated?</h2> <p>As of October 2025, SIXG tracks the BlueStar® Connective Technologies Index, which features a modified market cap weighting scheme.</p> <p>As explained by the ETF, this index is composed of</p> <blockquote><p>... companies whose business activity, products, or services meet the technical standards for, are used in the development of, or are otherwise instrumental in the rollout of 5G, or 6G networks, and other connective technologies...</p></blockquote> <p>To qualify, they must generate no less than 50% of their revenues from a rather vast group of technologies that are detailed on page 9 of the prospectus:</p> <blockquote><p>The Fund defines Connective Technology Companies to include: (i) manufacturers of core carrier grade networking equipment, including cellular antennas, routers and related semiconductor devices, (ii) satellite-based internet technology manufacturers and providers, (iii) mobile network operators (“MNOs”), (iv) enhanced mobile broadband chips and smart phone manufacturers, (v) manufacturers of new radio technology, wireless network test and optimization equipment, and cloud computing equipment, (vi) manufacturers and providers of software defined networking or network functions virtualization - including companies that focus on network/cloud analytics and monitoring platforms, and (vii) cell tower or data center real estate investment trusts (“REITs”).</p></blockquote> <h2 id=\"what-returns-has-sixg-been-capable-of-delivering\">What Returns Has SIXG Been Capable Of Delivering?</h2> <p>Let us look at the returns the ETF delivered before and after its strategy was refocused from the 5G communications to the connective tech.</p> <p>First, from March 5, 2019, to September 22, 2024, SIXG has considerably underperformed the overall market as represented by the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IVV\" title=\"iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF\">IVV</a>) as well as the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust ETF\">QQQ</a>).</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/saupload_158a08289af2b97930ab1c40156c2dc0.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

IVV was selected as a benchmark by the author</em></p> <p>All in all, SIXG has a rather expectable performance for a vehicle heavy in growth stocks: it does excellent in bull markets and underperforms dismally when bears dictate the rules.</p> <h2 id=\"who-is-sixg-for-and-how-does-it-fit-in-a-portfolio\">Who Is SIXG For, And How Does It Fit In A Portfolio?</h2> <p>SIXG might be an ETF of choice for investors seeking to profit from the 5G and 6G themes and who believe that passively managed vehicles targeting the communication sector, like the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR® ETF Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLC\" title=\"The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR® ETF Fund\">XLC</a>), simply do not offer enough exposure to them.</p> <p>Sure, they should be very fond of the growth factor and have little to no interest in value stocks (they are still present in SIXG but have a rather modest impact on its returns), and understand the risks that high achievers with generous valuations come with.</p> <p>As to the popular core-satellite system, SIXG looks like a decent satellite holding, with a core of the portfolio possibly being either IVV or any other S&amp;P 500 ETF like the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VOO\" title=\"Vanguard S&amp;P 500 ETF\">VOO</a>), the SPDR® S&amp;P 500® ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"SPDR® S&amp;P 500® ETF\">SPY</a>), and the SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPLG\" title=\"SPDR® Portfolio S&amp;P 500® ETF\">SPLG</a>), or QQQ.</p> <p>Importantly, position sizing is always key when building a tech-focused portfolio from various thematic blocks, as high-beta baskets of growthier stocks can deliver quite sensitive losses when conditions turn gloomy (marked by too high inflation, shifts in monetary policy from dovish to hawkish regimes, an overall weak macro environment, etc.). So investors should have a clear understanding of what share of their portfolios they can allocate to higher-risk names and what they are planning to do if these stocks enter a long period of losses.</p> <p>For context, in 2022 (even though the strategy was a little different back then, there is still some overlap with the current one), the ETF, traded with a ticker FIVG, delivered a maximum drawdown of 30.8% (vs. IVV's 23.93%), and its loss for the year was 27.25% (vs. IVV's loss of 18.16%).</p> <h2 id=\"how-is-sixg-built\">How Is SIXG Built?</h2> <p>As of October 27, 2025, there were 52 holdings in the SIXG portfolio, including 50 equities, the First American Government Obligations Fund 12/01/2031 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FGXXX\" title=\"First American Government Obligations Fund Inst\">FGXXX</a>), and cash &amp; other, with the latter two accounting for 0.24%.</p> <p>The top holding was Apple Inc.

Also, these high achievers are quite volatile, with 43% of the portfolio allocated to names with a 24-month beta of 1.5 or higher, as per my calculations. High P/E plus high-growth plus high beta means excellent returns in bull markets.

Financial data as of October 27, 2025. The weighted average Price/Sales and EV/EBITDA were adjusted for the impact of outliers, with those multiples at over 100x. For the WA earnings yield, EYs for loss-making companies were removed.</em></p> <h3 id=\"size-and-value\"><strong>Size And Value</strong></h3> <ul> <li>With just three trillion-dollar companies in the portfolio (vs. nine in IVV), SIXG has a weighted average market cap about 2.4x smaller.</li> <li>Despite that, its portfolio appears much more generously valued, as illustrated by its smaller adjusted WA earnings yield, as well as much higher adjusted WA Price/Sales and Enterprise Value/EBITDA. This creates meaningful risks investors should be prepared for.</li> </ul> <h3 id=\"growth\"><strong class=\"highlighted_text\">Growth</strong></h3> <p>SIXG has a stronger weighted average forward earnings growth rate, which partly explains why its EY is quite low (and translates into an almost 36x Price/Earnings) compared to IVV, plus more than half of its net assets are allocated to companies with a B- Quant Growth grade or higher. Still, the S&amp;P 500 ETF is offering more appealing forward revenue and EBITDA growth rates.</p> <h3 id=\"quality\"><strong class=\"highlighted_text\">Quality</strong></h3> <p>Most of <span id=\"jS$2311\" class=\"j3\">SIXG's</span> holdings are high-quality companies with capital efficiency indicators and margins at quite healthy levels. However, IVV is considerably stronger here. For instance, it has a larger exposure to companies with a B- Quant Profitability grade or higher.</p> <h3 id=\"low-volatility\"><strong>Low Volatility</strong></h3> <p>SIXG is much more into high-beta stocks than IVV. The bull markets are a boon for high-beta names, as they tend to capture over 100% of the S&amp;P 500 ETF's upside, delivering impressive gains. However, their losses in bear markets can be rather painful.</p> <h2 id=\"sixg-risks\">SIXG Risks</h2> <p>Like any other theme-focused ETF favoring growthier tech names, SIXG has two key risks.</p> <h3 id=\"high-achiever-valuation-risk\"><strong>High-Achiever Valuation Risk</strong></h3> <p>Companies with strong growth prospects, lofty multiples, and high beta — exactly those that account for the bulk of the ETF's net assets — are extremely sensitive to periods of market stress. In other words, deterioration in macro conditions, including, for instance, too high inflation, can be detrimental for SIXG's performance, resulting in steep losses, with a good example being 2022 (back then, its maximum drawdown was 30.84%).</p> <h3 id=\"theme-popularity-risk\"><strong>Theme Popularity Risk</strong></h3> <p>There is a risk that the 5G/6G theme will become less and less popular with ETF investors, with asset flows switching to newer and more promising areas (i.e., pure-play AI-focused vehicles), even though the rise of the \"AI connectivity\" sub-theme might partly compensate for that.</p> <p>Still, the fact is, SIXG saw some impressive inflows in the past, with AUM <a href=\"https://www.defianceetfs.com/the-first-5g-etf-fivg-hits-1-billion-in-aum/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.defianceetfs.com/the-first-5g-etf-fivg-hits-1-billion-in-aum/\" target=\"_blank\">surpassing</a> $1 billion in January 2021.

Nvidia has crossed the $5 trillion valuation mark amidst the growing fears for the AI bubble. And while the bubble concerns were confirmed by some industry leaders, I believe that Nvidia is not associated with it. The company has the potential to grow at least at a 30% angle, while the valuation has climbed to its fair value since my previous coverage.

Since then, the solid data center investment pipeline has pushed NVDA to become the world’s most valuable company. Apart from that, the AI frenzy is fueling the market bubble fears due to the circular large-scale investments between the main AI players. And because of the long-term nature of the investment plans, there will <span>always</span><span> </span>be skepticism about how many of those investments will break ground. In my view, the three-year horizon is quite a long-term period, as the dynamics of the trade disputes and geopolitical tensions cannot be really predicted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, let’s take a look at the current supply chain stance. TSMC projected mid-30% revenue growth due to the accelerating demand for AI and HPC chips from hyperscalers and AI-accelerator customers. The utilization of the leading-edge node is expected to be very high as the demand is surging. At the same time, the HBM supply is shaping up to be <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509111-sk-group-chairman-says-rapid-development-of-ai-data-centers-creating-bottlenecks\">tight,</a> with SK hynix Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HXSCF\" title=\"SK hynix Inc.\">OTCPK:HXSCF</a>) hinting at a sellout of its 2026 production capacity and AI-related demand <a href=\"https://wccftech.com/ai-related-hbm-demand-squeezing-out-ddr5-capacity-and-tightening-wafer-supply-mediatek-in-the-eye-of-the-storm/#:~:text=AI-related%20demand%20for%20high-bandwidth%20memory%20%28HBM%29%20is%20now,used%20in%20smartphones%27%20SoCs%2C%20such%20as%20the%20DDR5.\" rel=\"nofollow\">squeezing out</a> DDR5 capacity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another bottleneck spot is packaging, which is becoming increasingly important for the latest generation of AI chips. In addition, Amkor <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4509068-amkor-outlines-7b-arizona-campus-investment-and-projects-double-digit-q4-revenue-growth\">increased</a> its total investments for the new advanced packaging and test campus in Arizona up to $7 billion. Going further, Vertiv Holdings Co (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VRT\" title=\"Vertiv Holdings Co\">VRT</a>) reported surging orders and a robust backlog due to the strong <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4506587-vertiv-surges-9-percent-after-earnings-beat-raised-guidance-on-soaring-ai-infrastructure\">AI-driven demand</a> for digital infrastructure solutions such as power management, cooling systems and integrated data center platforms. Overall, the demand is prominently outstripping supply, and Microsoft Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) forecasts show a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-09/microsoft-forecasts-show-data-center-crunch-persisting-into-2026?srnd=phx-technology\" rel=\"nofollow\">data center crunch</a> persisting into 2026 as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But apart from the AI bubble, the competitive landscape is rising over. Besides the ASICs' collusions, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) is progressing to be the most fearful alternative with a full-stack Helios rack-scale AI platform, which is believed to be on par with Vera Rubin. Both systems feature 72 GPUs onboard and are expected to enter mass production in the back half of 2026. Now, let’s recall AMD’s $500 billion data center AI accelerator TAM estimate in 2028. The figure now seems more than viable given the fact that big tech is expected to dedicate more than $344 billion this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"664\" data-height=\"295\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Big Tech Capex\" width=\"640\" height=\"284\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267891346931_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Big Tech Capex <span>(Bloomberg)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The capital investments are growing at an impressive pace, with quarterly Capex from Meta, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft approaching the $100 billion level combined. On the other hand, another <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4500250-citi-sees-big-tech-hyperscalers-spending-2_8t-by-2029\">forecast</a> from Citi is pointing to $490 billion in AI Capex across the hyperscalers already in 2026 and a total of $2.8 trillion through 2029. And while I used to take the projections made by Nvidia’s executives with a grain of salt, the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4817296-nvidia-corporation-nvda-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">$3-4 trillion</a> in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade seems reasonable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But let’s stick to the $500 billion AI accelerator market size scenario, which is still a significant jump compared to some $130 billion in 2024. If we suppose that Nvidia would maintain around 60% market share, it suggests up to $300 billion in revenue from the data center segment in 2028, or circa 30% CAGR. Despite growing by 56% YoY in the second fiscal quarter of 2025, the company will come down to such a growth dynamic at some point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Data center segment revenue\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"578\" height=\"422\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51784773-17618267047954283.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Data center segment revenue <span>(Nvidia presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nonetheless, this projection is far more conservative compared to Jensen Huang’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510295-nvidia-makes-history-as-it-shatters-5t-market-cap-ceiling\">visibility</a> into half a trillion in sales for Grace Blackwell and Vera Rubin through 2026. This figure most likely includes the partnership with OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>) to deploy at least 10 gigawatts of Nvidia AI systems. Indeed, with the rollout of Blackwell Ultra systems, Nvidia is going to dominate the market in 2026 as well. However, we should discern the visibility from when this revenue is actually going to be recognized. And even if AMD comes up with a superior rack-scale platform, the point is that such a big market share is not going to dissipate any time soon. Because, as I wrote in my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4797121-amd-from-an-alternative-to-an-equal\">latest piece</a> on AMD, the main advantage of Nvidia is in the timing between architectural generations. AMD opted for a new process technology for its MI350 series, which took time for the transition to the 3nm lithography.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, Nvidia switched to a double-die package, effectively doubling the performance of the Hopper generation while staying at the same process node. Moreover, Nvidia is planning to shift its roadmap to only an <a href=\"https://wccftech.com/nvidia-has-already-geared-up-to-challenge-big-tech-custom-ai-chip-ambitions/\" rel=\"nofollow\">eight-month gap</a> in production ramp-up, which could be highly beneficial, especially when the market for AI systems continues to be supply chain-restricted.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reversion angle</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Against the backdrop of the AI bubble fears, it’s hard to believe that a company worth nearly $5 trillion with a 50% stock price gain since the beginning of the year is fairly valued. I used to mention that a 30% growth reversion angle could bring the valuation of NVDA stock down to the low 20x in FY2028. Apparently, it went so much faster due to the rapid expansion of data center build-outs.

I could confirm this with the following chart, which highlights that the earnings vector used moves in sync with the price performance dynamic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_2d6d4d326d4784d6f83306deecb0d8da.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going forward, I prefer to stick with a 30% growth angle to form a more conservative scenario. I believe that NVDA stock has room for 30% multiple expansions for the next 12-month horizon, or up to 43x forward P/E ratio. Given the analyst forecast of $6.02 EPS next year, this indicates a $261 value per share, which stipulates a 25% upside potential.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Investment takeaways</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With superior computing power and deep optimization, Nvidia accelerators deliver the world's highest performance for AI workloads, benefiting from the NVLink technology. Apart from that, the company develops high-performance networking (InfiniBand and Spectrum-X) solutions that enable the interconnection of large-scale clusters, which is especially relevant when we are talking about data center projects in gigawatt measure. The CUDA software stack is another strength, which has effectively become the industry standard, enabling the adaptation of GPUs to solve a wide range of computational tasks. These three pillars help Nvidia to retain customers in its ecosystem, due to the lack of meaningful substitution offerings, at least until the end of 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Apart from that, Nvidia is continuously teaming up with industry leaders to ensure its technology remains at the forefront amid the AI revolution. The scope of investment into data center build-outs is constantly growing, representing a strong growth potential visibility. The demand signals make tech giants spend relentlessly on artificial intelligence, with Microsoft planning to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510964-microsoft-outlines-fy26-capital-expenditure-acceleration-as-ai-demand-drives-80-percent-ai\">double</a> its data center footprint over the next 2 years, Meta signaling a strong Capex expansion, and Alphabet approaching $100 billion in investments for the year.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, I believe that NVDA deserves a Buy recommendation even at a $5 trillion market cap. It remains to be seen how much of that revenue visibility mentioned at the GTC will even be recognized in the following five quarters. But definitely, Nvidia has the potential to grow at least by 30% in the near term, which, against the backdrop of a low 30s valuation multiple, looks like a good entry point. And even with a conservative expectation for TAM potential, NVDA stock still has 25% upside for the next 12-month horizon.</p>",

RAV4’s sales leadership in the U.S.—the world's most profitable vehicle market—is <span>topping </span>on the cake for the Japanese automaker, the No. 1 automaker worldwide in terms of unit sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to the <a href=\"https://pressroom.toyota.com/the-next-adventure-begins-2026-rav4-arrives-this-winter/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://pressroom.toyota.com/the-next-adventure-begins-2026-rav4-arrives-this-winter/\" target=\"_blank\">Toyota newsroom</a>, prices for the new model will start in the low $30,000 range and rise to about $50,000 for the best-equipped versions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The new RAV4—available only as a gas-electric hybrid or plug-in hybrid—exemplifies Toyota’s determination to electrify its product line gradually and along multiple pathways, rather than swiftly with battery electric vehicles (BEVs), a strategy that has drawn criticism from environmental activists and others who argue in favor of rapid migration to BEVs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Toyota has argued that the limited worldwide capacity and resources for manufacturing batteries, inadequate charging infrastructure, and consumer hesitancy to switch to BEVs from internal combustion engines (especially in the U.S.) dictate a more deliberate and gradual move to BEVs over a longer period of time, perhaps many years. Ultimately, Toyota says, the overall reduction of so-called greenhouse gases will be greater under this strategy—while preserving the company’s financial health.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, automakers, including General Motors Co. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GM\" title=\"General Motors Company\">GM</a>) and Ford Motor Co. <span class=\"highlighted_text\">(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/F\" title=\"Ford Motor Company\">F</a>), h</span>ave booked massive losses, worker layoffs, and write-offs—with more to come—due to slow consumer acceptance of their first BEV models. Outside of China, where BEVs may be heavily subsidized and encouraged, automakers are now introducing BEVs more slowly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Governments, too, are rethinking policies meant to incentivize BEVs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Seamless technology</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In truth, many buyers will be unaware that their 2026 RAV4 is powered by a combination of a gasoline engine and a battery-powered electric motor; the system smoothly and quietly (according to this writer’s experience during a test drive) produces an average fuel efficiency of up to 44 miles to the gallon, combined city and highway, according to Toyota’s estimate. The RAV4’s battery receives charge from the engine, meaning that it doesn’t need external charging.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A second RAV4 version, the plug-in hybrid, has a larger battery than the standard gas-electric and must be charged; it offers an emission-free, electric-only range of about 52 miles before the gasoline engine kicks in to power the vehicle in hybrid mode. The plug-in may be operated without charging as well, and can be driven in gas-electric hybrid mode exclusively.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2337\" data-height=\"1587\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"infographic\" width=\"640\" height=\"435\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"435\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-1761838625012042_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Rise of gas electric hybrids <span>(Wards Intelligence)</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Toyota says the new RAV4 will be the first of its product line to feature the newest version of the Toyota Auto Multimedia system, which offers “faster, more responsive voice assistant; a new customizable home menu; and Toyota's first application of onboard 5G connectivity.” Toyota had been criticized for earlier infotainment systems that excluded Apple CarPlay and Android systems; the automaker has since changed course and allowed its system to be more easily paired and synced with smartphones.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Toyota builds a majority of its vehicles in North America, those imported from Canada and Mexico have been subject to the administration’s tariffs. The new RAV4 will be built primarily in Georgetown, Ky., and Cambridge, Ontario, with some models imported from Japan. Accordingly, Toyota in August said its operating profit for the fiscal year ended March 30 is estimated to be reduced to $21.7 billion, or 16.3%, from its prior forecast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Toyota shares shrugged off the guidance, rising about 15% since then while outperforming major market indices.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rising taxes</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, tariffs remain a major stumbling block in front of earnings growth. Toyota has formulated a response, however, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4827928-toyota-moving-forward-with-a-strategic-way-to-play-the-tariffs\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4827928-toyota-moving-forward-with-a-strategic-way-to-play-the-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\">which was outlined earlier this month</a> by Seeking Alpha analyst James Hires earlier this month. Bolstered by its vaunted financial strength, the automaker has elected to absorb a significant portion of the tariff burden by limiting price hikes that it otherwise might have taken. Last June, Toyota evidently increased prices by a smaller margin than those of competitors, thus improving its value proposition, which should help to drive sales.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1322\" data-height=\"760\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"car\" width=\"640\" height=\"368\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"368\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/694722-17618363309750984_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">2026 RAV4 plug-in hybrid version <span>(Toyota Motor)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, Toyota has told U.S. trade officials it is looking to export U.S.-made models to Japan, a move designed to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4508823-toyota-has-a-strategy-to-appease-the-trump-administration\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4508823-toyota-has-a-strategy-to-appease-the-trump-administration\" target=\"_blank\">“appease” the U.S. administration</a> and help redress the trade deficit with Japan, which was about $70 billion in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the Tokyo Mobility Show this week, the automaker took the wraps off a BEV concept of the next-gen Corolla compact sedan, the best-selling model in its history, with more than 55 million manufactured since the nameplate was introduced in 1966.

Iberdrola</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Iberdrola was founded in 1840 and is based in Bilbao (Spain). The company operates within the Electric Utilities Industry and presently offers investors a dividend yield [FWD] of 4.80%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Iberdrola not only provides potential for dividend income, but also for dividend growth, which is reflected in its EPS FWD Long-Term Growth Rate [3-5Y CAGR] of 7.33% and its 3-Year dividend growth rate [CAGR] of 15.22%, making it also a candidate for potential inclusion in our dividend portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's P/E GAAP [FWD] Ratio is at 16.67, which is significantly below the sector median of 20.12, demonstrating that Iberdrola is currently undervalued. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">5. CVS Health</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CVS Health presently offers investors a free cash flow yield [TTM] of 4.56%. This implies that the company's stock price is not a result of particularly high-growth expectations, allowing investors to invest with a margin of safety. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's attractive valuation is also reflected in its P/E GAAP [FWD] ratio of 21.29, which is 14.53% below the Sector Median.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CVS Health's dividend yield [FWD] is presently at 3.20%. The company's payout ratio of 41.96% and its 5-Year dividend growth rate [CAGR] of 5.87% indicate room for future dividend enhancements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Seeking Alpha Dividend Grades underline CVS Health's solid dividend.

Merck &amp; Co</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Merck is also among these types of companies that offer investors both income and dividend growth potential, aligning with the investment strategy of The Dividend Income Accelerator Portfolio. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Merck presently pays a dividend yield [FWD] of 3.70%, while its <span>payout ratio</span> stands at 41.36%. The company's potential for dividend growth is further underlined by its 14 consecutive years of dividend growth and its 5-Year dividend growth rate [CAGR] of 6.85%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to that, it is worth highlighting the company's attractive valuation, which is reflected in its P/E GAAP [FWD] ratio of 11.38, which stands 54.30% below the sector median and 58.87% below the company's 5-Year Average. This indicates that Merck &amp; Co is presently undervalued.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">7. Verizon</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With 21 consecutive years of dividend growth, a current <span>dividend yield</span> [FWD] of 6.85%, and a <span>payout ratio</span> of 57.66%, Verizon offers investors an attractive income for today with modest dividend growth potential. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, with a current P/E [FWD] ratio of 8.77 (which stands 53.73% below the sector median), the company provides investors an attractive <span>valuation</span> and a margin of safety when investing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to the above, it can be highlighted that Verizon's particularly high free cash flow yield [TTM] of 11.52%, which stands significantly above the sector median of 8.01%, allows the company to pay an attractive and sustainable amount of dividends.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">8. Altria</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Altria presently offers investors a free cash flow yield [TTM] of 8.09%. This number indicates that investors can benefit from an investment in Altria even if the company were unable to significantly increase their earnings in the coming years. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the company's present price level, Altria pays a dividend yield [FWD] of 6.65%, which I consider to be sustainable, particularly when considering the company's previously mentioned free cash flow yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Altria's EBIT margin [TTM] presently stands at 60.63%, which is an indicator of the company's excellent competitive position within its industry from which investors can benefit when investing over the long term. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">9. Ares Capital</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">According to Wall Street, Ares Capital is currently a <span>\"B</span>uy,\" receiving a <span>\"S</span>trong Buy\" rating from nine analysts, and a \"Buy\" rating from four analysts.

When I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4453654-airbnb-stock-outlook-post-pandemic-era\">first turned bullish</a> on Airbnb, Inc. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB\" title=\"Airbnb, Inc.\">ABNB</a></span>) in September 2021, I was banking on the post-pandemic travel boom to drive revenue and earnings<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> growth higher. Although this expectation has indeed materialized, in hindsight, it is evident that Mr. Market had already priced this into the company's valuation. Since my first buy call, ABNB stock is down ~21%, which is not a pleasant sight given how the S&amp;P 500 has delivered stellar returns during the same period. I, of course, invested in ABNB as the stock retreated so my cost is around $125 per share today, and I am hardly at the breakeven point today.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With Airbnb expected to release Q3 earnings on November 6, exactly from a week from this writing, I wanted to take a step back to evaluate why the stock has gone nowhere for several years despite robust earnings growth (from a loss of $352 million in 2021, Airbnb has come a long way to report a profit of $2.63 billion in the past 12 months). What I found was that I had been too early to bet on the company's diversification efforts. In many of my follow-up articles since the initial buy call, which you can find <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4633861-airbnb-maintaining-my-bullish-stance-in-the-face-of-new-challenges\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4647093-airbnb-short-term-peak-in-demand-in\">here</a>, I discussed why I thought Airbnb's growth would accelerate as the company expands into ancillary services similar to how Booking Holdings Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BKNG\" title=\"Booking Holdings Inc.\">BKNG</a>) did. This is what I got wrong in the past 4+ years. Airbnb could never execute this strategy to perfection, and what we saw was a deceleration in revenue growth, which spooked Mr. Market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Exhibit 1: Airbnb annual revenue growth</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1986\" data-height=\"790\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Airbnb annual revenue growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"255\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618408570992405_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While growth decelerated, Airbnb shifted its focus to improving profitability. This is not a bad outcome, of course, but the market was not willing to reward Airbnb with premium valuation multiples while growth moderated, rightly so. Sooner rather than later, you want high-growth companies to turn profitable but not at the cost of growth. Airbnb has turned into a cash flow machine (TTM FCF of $4.28 billion). Some of these cash flows have been used to return capital to shareholders as well (TTM stock repurchases worth $3.7 billion).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are all signs of a business that is growing profitably, but without an acceleration in revenue growth, I believe ABNB stock will trade sideways for the foreseeable future. This is why, in my opinion, the upcoming Q3 report will be a pivotal moment for ABNB as the management is expected to reveal the progress of the Airbnb Services business that was launched last May along with the redesign of the Experiences platform, provide new numbers to evaluate the growth in expansion markets, and also give color on the progress of integrating hotel booking into the Airbnb app.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Look Beyond Just Headline Numbers To Assess Airbnb's Growth Potential</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Airbnb is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB/earnings/estimates?period=quarterly\">expected to report</a> $2.32 in EPS for Q3 on revenue of $4.08 billion. The company has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABNB/earnings/eps-surprise-summary?period=quarterly\">topped analyst expectations</a> for EPS on each of the past 3 quarters, but as illustrated below, the magnitude of these surprises has been well below the average seen in 2022 and 2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Exhibit 2: Airbnb earnings surprise history</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1956\" data-height=\"878\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Airbnb earnings surprise history\" width=\"640\" height=\"287\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49736731-17618234742565582_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although an earnings surprise (or the lack of it) could indeed move ABNB stock in post-earnings trading, as a long-term-oriented investor, I am more interested in deciphering whether Airbnb's growth is likely to accelerate in the foreseeable future or remain under pressure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, a reacceleration in growth hinges on three important factors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the short to medium term, whether we see an acceleration of revenue growth will be largely determined by the success of Airbnb's international expansion plans. In Q2, the management revealed that Airbnb's expansion markets (the likes of Japan and Brazil) are seeing much faster growth in nights booked compared to its core markets (U.S., UK, Canada, etc.). Commenting on the <a href=\"https://s26.q4cdn.com/656283129/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Airbnb_Q2-2025-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">fast growth observed in expansion markets</a>, CEO Brian Chesky wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>For six consecutive quarters, nights booked on an origin basis in our expansion markets have grown at about twice the rate of our core markets. This sustained growth is a result of our focus on achieving product-market fit, increasing brand awareness, and driving traffic in key countries.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Later in the shareholder letter, CEO Chesky revealed that both demand and supply in expansion markets grew at more than double the pace at which they grew in core markets in Q2. When Airbnb reports Q3 earnings next week, I will be paying close attention to these metrics to see if this trend continues in the third quarter as well. Given that Airbnb's core markets are seeing a moderation in growth, expansion markets hold the key to driving overall profitability and revenue growth higher in the next 4-6 quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Airbnb's focus on expansion markets seems timely given that industry experts project these markets to grow at a faster clip than well-established core markets. Boston Consulting Group <a href=\"https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/the-15-trillion-opportunity-in-leisure-travel\" rel=\"nofollow\">expects to see the biggest gains</a> in countries such as China, India, and Vietnam in the next 12 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Exhibit 3: Leisure trip destinations booked in the past 12 months and expectations for growth</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://web-assets.bcg.com/dims4/default/9befc52/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x2998+0+0/resize/768x640!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fboston-consulting-group-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F63%2F78%2F637a79584b15af2e00cd5fbb8c6a%2Ftraveler-of-the-future-ex02.png\" alt=\"Leisure trip destinations booked in the past 12 months and expectations for growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Boston Consulting Group</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As long as we are seeing continued growth in nights booked in expansion markets, I would be comfortable with my ABNB investment as I believe this would buy the company sufficient time to invest in two other growth engines—hotels and services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When we expand our timeline from the next 4 quarters to the next 2 years, I believe the most important growth driver will be Airbnb's hotel push. Back in 2019, <a href=\"https://news.airbnb.com/hoteltonight-and-airbnb-finalize-acquisition/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Airbnb acquired HotelTonight</a> to expand into the hotel booking sector. However, until recently, we did not see an aggressive push by the company to take market share from industry leaders in this space. That is changing now. Airbnb is now planning to add a new hotel interface into its app, finally delivering on its 2019 promise to directly compete with industry leaders in this space such as Booking.com. Speaking at the Skift Global Forum last month, <a href=\"https://www.phocuswire.com/brian-chesky-hotel-interface-airbnb\" rel=\"nofollow\">CEO Chesky said</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The concrete thing is we are now getting serious about hotels. We bought HotelTonight. We always had intended to integrate it into Airbnb. Then the pandemic hit, and similar to Experiences, we put everything on hold.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Commenting further on this upcoming hotel integration, CEO Chesky confirmed that the company is planning to give travelers the option to book a wide variety of hotel options within the Airbnb app, including boutique hotels, star-class hotel chains, and independent hotels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The hotel booking market adds a massive new opportunity for Airbnb. According to Bernstein analysts, the hotel booking market is <a href=\"https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/deep-dive-on-the-hotel-opportunity-for-airbnb-4229398\" rel=\"nofollow\">approximately 9 times bigger</a> than the short-term rentals market. CEO Chesky has already discussed how travelers use different apps to book hotels when they can't find something suitable on Airbnb, so the company is setting up the stage to keep these travelers within their ecosystem by integrating hotel booking into the app. I believe this will be one of the biggest revenue growth drivers in the next 2 years. For this reason, when Airbnb reports Q3 earnings, I will be paying close attention to management commentary about how these integration plans are moving forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the long term (think of 3+years), the services segment could turn out to be a massive growth driver for Airbnb if the expansion strategy is executed to perfection. Airbnb's goal is to set up the services business as a standalone unit where a traveler does not necessarily have to book an Airbnb stay to avail these services. Last May, the company <a href=\"https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-2025-summer-release/\" rel=\"nofollow\">launched 10 different categories</a> of services including chefs, photography, and spa treatments. In Q3 commentary, the management is likely to discuss the initial market response to these services. During the Q2 earnings call, the management revealed some promising numbers such as a 4.9-star rating for new offerings but the services business had just launched back then. Maintaining a similar level of positive ratings during Q3 should be considered a massive green flag for the future of this segment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am looking forward to Airbnb's Q3 earnings release as I believe management commentary (both in the shareholder letter and during the earnings call) will be full of interesting data points that paint a good picture of the company's growth potential. Without a reacceleration in revenue growth, I believe ABNB stock will continue to deliver lackluster returns as an expansion in valuation multiples cannot be expected just because the company is turning into a cash-flow machine. Given the valuation risks faced by the company, I am maintaining my neutral stance on ABNB ahead of the Q3 earnings print, but I may turn bullish even at these prices if the company gives me reason to be optimistic about the probability of an acceleration in growth in the next few quarters.</p>",

Things like this tend to please the market, which ends up being rewarded with re-ratings. This increase in recurring sales should soften the company's total sales because, as we will see below, the ratings segment can be somewhat cyclical.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are two main reasons for this, which we will look at in more detail later.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. The zero capacity for capital reinvestment on the Ratings side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. The acquisitions made in Analytics in recent years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2022, there was a significant increase in the Analytics segment, from 39% to 51% of sales. This is due to a major acquisition in this segment. On the capital allocation side we will see how they have done several of these in recent years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In any case, the 70% EBIT margin of MIS vs. 31% of MA (although also expanding) means that ratings represent 54% of sales but 70% of EBIT.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"886\" data-height=\"647\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Moody's Revenues\" width=\"640\" height=\"467\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617496195659041_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author's representation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Moody's Investors Services (MIS)</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moody's ratings are divided into several types depending on the type of issuer, although corporate (company) bonds clearly predominate.

From 2021 to the end of 2022, you can see how each quarter they were getting less sales than in the previous quarter, the result of declines in issuance volumes due to the abrupt and massive rise in interest rates that was experienced in 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In general, debt tends to be issued in what are called \"issuance waves\", but every wave generates a subsequent undertow, which we will see in the \"refinancing wall\" part.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The good thing about credit ratings is that companies tend to use more than one rating provider for the same issue, so we can say that the services of Moody's and S&amp;P Global Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPGI\" title=\"S&amp;P Global Inc.\">SPGI</a>) are not mutually exclusive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The summary of this segment is that it is an oligopoly with 70% margins in a non-exclusive market.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Moody's Analytics (MA)</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moody's Analytics offers a wide range of risk-related data and analytical content, including credit research, quantitative credit ratings, economic research, business intelligence, know-your-customer tools, commercial real estate data, training services, ESG and risk management software for financial institutions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Debt investors are looking for analytics to understand risks such as credit and counterparty risk. Moody's offers tools that predict the probability of default and provide real-time ratings, as well as early warnings and historical data going back to the 1970s. All of this allows for accurate debt pricing and valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And in some cases, this credit data can have a history of up to 100 years, something irreplicable for any new competitor.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In any case, this is a much more highly competitive segment, which we see tending to grow by acquisitions. Estimates here are less reliable, but we should continue to have a slight margin expansion while the company's percentage of recurring sales increases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last decline in the percentage of recurring sales was because the ratings segment (less recurring) grew by 33% last year, compared to 7.8% growth in Analytics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"819\" data-height=\"476\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Types of Revenues\" width=\"640\" height=\"372\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-17617499459439263_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author's Representation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capital Allocation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moody's has made several acquisitions over the past two decades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To reduce the cyclicality of the ratings business, management decided in 2007-2008 to create Moody's Analytics, using data from the ratings business to build the subscription model mentioned above.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since then, they have expanded the scale and scope of this business through a series of acquisitions.

However, impeccable management of operating expenses has played a key role in this margin increase. They are up 1% vs. +11% in sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recurring revenues, which represent 96% of Moody's Analytics (MA) total revenues, grew by 11% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic and constant exchange rate basis. Transaction revenues declined 19%, reflecting MA's continued strategic shift to subscription-based solutions. The good news is that recurrence on the Ratings side is already 69% as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this data is very good overall, but I feel like talking about the Q3 results to link directly to the next section on risks, as I think they did a brilliant exposition of them in the call.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the stock now seems to be suffering from a possible AI risk on the Analytics side, we will see how that risk is quite unlikely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, large US banks are incorporating their models and data into internal AI-based workflows. In fact, they signed a $3 million-plus contract with a Tier 1 bank in the U.S., which will use their tools to automate credit reports and deploy early warning systems in real estate portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its AI strategy has several layers. The first is an internal platform that allows all employees to build AI agents to redesign processes and gain productivity. Added to this is their \"AI Studio Factory,\" focused on developing agentic products (basically, intelligent agents that use their own data and APIs).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I also don't see the risk of regulation as very likely. I mean, sure at some point it will be tried, but if they are doing better than in the 2008 crisis, it is not difficult and hopefully they have learned the lesson, their Ratings system is something that works well globally; I don't see the incentives or the way to change that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other major risk is, directly, already something almost impossible and would put an end to the thesis of gold and Bitcoin, a deleveraging and good economic and budgeting, globally. A utopia. Although a period like this was lived from WWII to 1970.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Half related to this, however, is the risk of the growth of private markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When a company uses the private credit market, it accesses financing through private loans, does not issue public bonds and, therefore, does not need a credit rating. In these cases, institutional investors conduct their own risk analysis without resorting to agencies such as Moody's. This means that, as the company's credit rating increases, it will be able to make its own risk analysis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This means that, as private credit gains ground, the volume of government debt requiring a rating decreases, potentially reducing Moody's core business. CEO Robert Fauber himself explained that the alliance with MSCI stems precisely from the need to offer an independent assessment of private credit risk. It seeks to add value from another angle: helping investors to understand and compare risk with a \"trusted third party\" view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although on the call they commented that they are starting to see some flow back from private credit into the public markets, mainly because coupons in the public market are significantly cheaper than private financing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While not an immediate threat, it is a gradual and sustained pressure on their traditional revenue model.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This valuation method effectively combines a sort of multiples-based valuation, the minimum required rates of return for the stock, and the total return shareholders can achieve in the form of dividends and share buybacks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using 2024 FCF as a starting point, I believe that both of Moody's segments can grow at high single-digit rates. The MIS segment is driven by refinancing wall volumes and annual price increases in the order of 4% and the MA segment, I believe, can have organic growths of 5% plus a few extra points inorganically. With the use of AI these companies are becoming much more efficient businesses with the ability to increase margins. So, I think FCF will be able to grow at rates of 12% in a base case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we assume an exit multiple of 30x and discount the future value at a minimum required internal rate of return of 12%, factoring in projected dividends and the estimated stock price in 2029, we calculate a fair value of $460 per share. This price would ensure achieving the minimum 12% return over the next 5 years if these assumptions hold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For all these reasons, I rate the stock as a hold, as it is currently trading at 490$.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"948\" data-height=\"193\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"130\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/53229413-1761751309748611_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Author's Representation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moody's strikes me as a fantastic business, which the market may be unfairly penalizing because of ill-founded fears around AI in its Moody's Analytics segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This could create buying opportunities in the company that could benefit long-term investors who understand the business well.
