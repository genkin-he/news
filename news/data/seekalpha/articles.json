In the BNPL sector, we have ''Prime'' players like Affirm (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AFRM\" title=\"Affirm Holdings, Inc.\">AFRM</a>) and Klarna (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KLAR\" title=\"Klarna Group plc\">KLAR</a>), and the players in the ''Subprime'' vertical that serve<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the unbanked. Sezzle fits into this category. In this article, I will explore their business model, the successful pivot to subscription based revenue, and the trajectory of their credit losses. So far, I have watched Sezzle from the sidelines due to my concerns over rising credit losses as a percentage of GMV. But in the Q4 released February 25, 2026, we saw a significant YoY decline in provisions for credit losses, and consequently a rise in the stock price in the after hours trading. This data de-risks investing in the company, and therefore, I am initiating a Buy rating. In my opinion, this remains a high-risk, high-reward play due to the undeniable high growth, but subprime lending sector risk remains, although it seems management is successfully mitigating it.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business Model</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For those unfamiliar with Sezzle, they are a Buy-now-Pay-later provider that is specifically targeting the customer with the lowest credit score, who is unable to access traditional credit cards. The company’s primary differentiator is the Sezzle Up credit-building platform. This allows the user to slowly build up their credit score while using the platform, since Sezzle reports to all three major bureaus - TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Users link their bank accounts via Plaid and agree to credit reporting, which allows Sezzle visibility into a user's bank balance and their income streams. This direct access to cash-flow data allows Sezzle to better estimate a user’s ability to repay, allowing them to filter out liabilities before they default.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that this feature creates high retention rates. A user that is actively building their credit score from, say, 500 to 600 using Sezzle is less likely to churn than, for example, a user that is using BNPL simply for a one-off purchase. Yet this creates a risk that once a user builds a sufficient credit score needed to get approved for a credit card, they are likely to churn simply because Sezzle is just too expensive compared to the $0 monthly fees of prime credit products. Note that Sezzle charges <a href=\"https://legal.sezzle.com/fees/en-us\" rel=\"nofollow\">$19.99 per month</a> for the Sezzle Anywhere service. As the name says, the subscription plan allows the subscriber to use Sezzle anywhere, not only at direct partnered merchants.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other option is Sezzle Premium which costs between <a href=\"https://legal.sezzle.com/fees/en-us\" rel=\"nofollow\">$13.99</a> per month, depending on the tier, but has fewer merchants available. More details can be found on their website. In my opinion, a user trying to build a credit score needs to be able to use BNPL anywhere, and most importantly at major retailers like Walmart or Target, because that is where, I believe, the low-income subscribers spend the majority of their money. This subscription thesis was, in my opinion, validated in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20414069-sezzle-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2025-results#source=section%3Aearnings_summary%7Csection_asset%3Aearnings_history%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3Apress-release\">Q4 earnings release</a>, as Monthly On-Demand &amp; Subscribers reached 918,000, with 134,000 new users being added in Q4. Such users will continue to provide predictable and stable revenue, as long as the company continues to keep provisions for credit losses low.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI Underwriting</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the Q3 2025 earnings call, CEO Charlie Youakim highlighted the use of AI as a tool for risk assessment and operational leverage. I believe this is an excellent choice; first, because of analyzing cash transactions in real time, which Sezzle has access to due to the Sezzle Up. As their AI gets better, the provisions for credit losses might go down as a percentage of GMV. Second is that Sezzle is growing fast. In Q3, Sezzle grew their revenues by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SEZL/income-statement\">approx. 66%</a> YoY. Normally, that would require hiring additional staff, but the CEO noted that its AI will likely allow them to keep the support team at the same size or that it could even shrink. In Q4 company reported that: ''Total Operating Expenses grew 10.8% YoY to $74.6 million, well below revenue growth of 32.2%.'' I regard this margin expansion as evidence that the AI strategy is working, and operating expenses as part of revenue should continue to decrease.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Provisions for Credit Losses</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One thing that worried me prior to initiating coverage were the rising provisions for credit losses as a % of GMV, as is evident from the Table 1. Until Q4 such losses kept increasing both YoY and QoQ, which was the main reason I avoided the company. Below is the table showing provisions for credit losses data for the last 8 quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/6455341-17721029402480273_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"847\" data-height=\"411\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/6455341-17721029402480273_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Provisions for credit losses\" width=\"640\" height=\"311\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/6455341-17721029402480273_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/6455341-17721029402480273_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/6455341-17721029402480273_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/6455341-17721029402480273_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Table 1 <span>(Author's work)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q4, we can clearly see a reversal of the metric that worried me most. Provisions for credit losses declined by 80 basis points to 2% of GMV. Management stated that this is due to ''Favorable repayment performance and conservative holiday season underwriting.'' I view this as a sign that management successfully tightened underwriting standards while maintaining high growth, which is the reason I turned bullish.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The improvement in this metric also impacted the bottom line, with adjusted EBITDA increasing 79.1% YoY to $58.3 million, and net income reaching $42.7 million, advancing 68.3% YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An investor must continue to watch this metric closely. Management guided for provisions for credit losses to stay between 2.5% and 3% in FY2026. Note that this is still higher than in FY2025, as according to my calculations, they were at 2.27%, which is the main reason I am issuing a ''Bullish'' and not a ''Very Bullish'' rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management guided FY2026 adjusted EPS to be $4.70 with revenue growth between 25% and 30%. At the current price of $72, the forward (adjusted) PE ratio would be approx. 15x. For a company with a projected growth of 27.5% at the midpoint, this is cheap, especially considering stable SaaS revenue. I believe the main reason that it is trading at this price is the past increase in the provisions for credit losses metric. Peers like Enova International (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ENVA\" title=\"Enova International, Inc.\">ENVA</a>) and Credit Acceptance (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CACC\" title=\"Credit Acceptance Corporation\">CACC</a>) are both trading at a 13x PE multiple. Both Enova and Credit Acceptance are in the subprime lending business, but are growing much more slowly. Affirm (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AFRM\" title=\"Affirm Holdings, Inc.\">AFRM</a>) is trading at a GAAP 61x PE multiple (although the forward PE multiple is around 29x).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see two scenarios that can happen here; the first is that management executes well and keeps credit losses between 2.5% and 3%. In such a case, we should see the PE multiple expand. For a company with a SaaS revenue model, although exposed to subprime lending, growing at 27.5%, I believe a fair PE multiple should be between 20 and 25x. This represents significant upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, if we see weakness in the economy, it is possible that provisions for credit losses to deteriorate. In such a case, I believe that the stock will decline to reach a valuation similar to the slow-growing subprime lenders like Enova and Credit Acceptance, which I mentioned earlier.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plan</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 earnings results significantly de-risked investing in the company. I am issuing a ''Buy'' rating, and I plan to open an initial position. I will also closely monitor provisions for credit losses in Q1 2026 and potential changes in guidance for FY2026.</p>",

In our last update, we increased our estimates for both top-line<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> sales and core operating profit margin; however, despite forecasts sitting above Wall Street consensus, valuation was largely reflected in the share price. Following the earnings release, the company's shares re-rated, although the current price remains within our valuation range.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our analysis also incorporates additional insight from Moncler's latest collection (happening nowadays in Milan with an exhibition <a href=\"https://www.voce.it/it/articolo/1/economia/al-via-da-oggi-la-milano-fashion-week-autunno-inverno-2026-2027\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.voce.it/it/articolo/1/economia/al-via-da-oggi-la-milano-fashion-week-autunno-inverno-2026-2027\" target=\"_blank\">called</a> 'The Beyond Performance Exhibit'), where management provided an update on the Grenoble line.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moncler Results and Our Neutral Take</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moncler delivered solid results in 2025, with sales acceleration in Q4. In numbers, the company reached top-line sales of €3.13 billion (<a href=\"https://www.monclergroup.com/v3/assets/blt61bda6b71f29a239/blt48f3ab2962e62ae4/69973d944147a5b95c8024f1/Moncler-Group-Press-Release-FY-2025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fig. 1</a>), up 3%, while Q4 turnover increased by 7% compared to Q4 2024. On the company's margins, the company reported an EBIT of €913.4 million, down from €916.3 million in 2024. So, EBIT margin declined by 30 basis points to 29.2% from 29.5%. Looking at the Wall Street consensus, the company delivered a 5% beat on Fiscal Year EBIT, with clear acceleration in H2 performance. Both Moncler and Stone Island sales accelerated in Q4. In numbers, the Moncler brand grew retail sales by 7%, accelerating from Q3 flattish results, and Stone Island was impressively up by +16% ex-FX movement in the DTC segment. Going down to the P&amp;L, Moncler recorded higher interest payments (due to a higher net debt position), so net profit reached €626.7 million, down from €639.6 million in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720441614613917.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Moncler FY 2025 results in a Snap\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"632\" height=\"415\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720441614613917.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720441614613917.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720441614613917.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Moncler FY 2025 results in a Snap</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fig 1</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why are we still muted?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After this set of results, Moncler's post-earnings re-rating was expected; however, we believe much of the positive news flow is now reflected in the current valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Businesswise, there are at least four negative considerations to report:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Moncler management's tone was positive, flagging that Q4 sales acceleration has continued into Q1 so far, at both brands. In reality, Moncler exhibited higher winter seasonality in the last 2 years (72-73% of Fiscal Year revenue is concentrated in Q1 and Q4, compared to a pre-COVID-19 average of 69%.</li> <li>Moncler DTC channel was under pressure until Q3 with flattish to negative results. This was a meaningful slowdown compared to history, with seasonality improvement. Again, the company was back to growth in Q4, but we are not sure about 2026.</li> <li>China (and the APAC region) still represents a significant market for the company (Fig. 2), but competition from both local and international brands is heating up. We report the latest news on <a href=\"https://www.chinadailyhk.com/hk/article/599901?utm_source\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.chinadailyhk.com/hk/article/599901?utm_source\" target=\"_blank\">China Daily</a>: \"With sourcing of goose down from regions like Hungary and Canada, Guvet aims to rival luxury names like Moncler. <a href=\"https://www.suntzurecruit.com/2026/02/05/why-high-end-sports-brands-are-poaching-luxury-executives/?utm\" rel=\"noopener\" title=\"https://www.suntzurecruit.com/2026/02/05/why-high-end-sports-brands-are-poaching-luxury-executives/?utm\" target=\"_blank\">Bosideng</a> is also a competitor with similar price points. As a reminder, 38% of Moncler sales are with Chinese consumers.</li> <li>Lastly, we had the chance to view the new Aspen collection. The new collection is priced 30% above the Grenoble line. The Moncler brand has benefited from a shift toward ski performance rather than fashion cycles. Moncler's marketing team has done a great job with experience-led activities (St Moritz and Courchevel) and strategic, disruptive partnerships (the latest Brazil Olympics sponsorship). Still, the company's pricing power has not been enough. Price power is expected to be +3% in 2026, compared to a high mid-single-digit level in the past. This suggests the customer base may be becoming more sensitive to further price increases, reinforcing our value-for-money thesis for Compagnie Financière Richemont.

Below, we <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872431-moncler-s-p-a-monry-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872431-moncler-s-p-a-monry-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> the UBS Q&amp;A session on the 2026 Moncler outlook and the responses from Roberto Eggs, Chief Business Strategy &amp; Global Market Officer and Executive Director at Moncler.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"<em>We see a business for Moncler that is going to stay flattish for 2026. And we see an improvement on the results for the wholesale with Stone Island. I'm not saying positive, but clearly an improvement compared to what we have had in 2025.</em>\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the FY presentation, Moncler did not provide a 2026 outlook. This is not positive. We still incorporated 2026 sales estimates at +4.5% to €3.2 billion, including 10/15 new store openings. Given limited margin visibility and the management team's tight cost control, we see good SG&amp;A control and the usual 7% in marketing expenses. This was also reported in the Q&amp;A analyst call. Therefore, we slightly reduce the core operating profit to 29%, resulting in an EBIT of €928 million. The company has minimal interest expenses, and with solid FCF generation, we believe interest expenses could also be lowered (from €26 million to €20 million). Considering a 29% tax rate, we derive a net income of €644.68 million. Given the <a href=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=MONC:MIL\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=MONC:MIL\" target=\"_blank\">current outstanding shares</a>, we reached an EPS of €2.34. This represents a 1.5% increase in EPS compared to 2025. At this stage, Moncler trades at a P/E of 24.7x, in <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-global-luxury-index/#overview\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-global-luxury-index/#overview\" target=\"_blank\">line</a> with its peers' average. This is true not only at a P/E level but also on a Price-to-Sales basis. Even applying the projected P/E multiple to peers, the company's target price would have reached €59.78, with limited upside to the current €57.8 price. We remain neutral weighted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720462647492323_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"770\" data-height=\"111\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720462647492323_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Luxury P/E Multiple Valuation Data\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"92\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720462647492323_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720462647492323_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720462647492323_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51181085-17720462647492323_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Luxury P/E Multiple Valuation Data</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fig 3</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We have long covered Moncler, and downside risks include lower winter sales (and high winter seasonality) and EBIT margin pressure from higher SG&amp;A and marketing costs.

Expanding a specialty platform that takes on financial risk comes with added pressure.

Fourth Quarter 2025 Presentation <span>(Evolent Health)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Evolent didn’t waste time. It ditched the old approach and swung to what it calls the Performance Suite model. By now, nearly all of the higher-margin business has been moved into that new structure. Under this updated model, payments are adjusted to account for outside medical cost factors. Also, there are built-in limits (called corridors) that cap how much money the company could lose if costs end up being higher than expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The renegotiation helped the company keep its most important existing customers and also bring in major new partners, using contract terms that offer better protection. In simple terms, the company gave up the chance to make the highest possible profits at times. But in return, it gained more stable and predictable results. It’s a sensible move, given the volatility in specialty trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That tradeoff makes even more sense when you consider what’s powering the business today. Oncology is now responsible for most of the company’s growth. It’s a direct response to one of the biggest pain points in healthcare spending. Insurance companies are still dealing with consistently high and rising costs in cancer treatment. There's also a lot of variation in how doctors treat patients, which can affect both costs and outcomes. So Evolent’s edge here is that it can get physicians to stick to evidence-based pathways. Keep in mind, unfortunately, cancer care and high-cost specialty drugs are expected to keep pushing healthcare costs higher this year. According to an <a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/health-industries/library/behind-the-numbers.html\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">analysis</a> from PricewaterhouseCoopers, medical costs in commercial insurance markets are projected to rise by about 8%, with oncology and specialty drugs being major reasons for that increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, rolling out several large new contracts this year is putting temporary pressure on profits. These new agreements are expected to generate significant revenue. However, in the first few months, the company has to set aside extra financial reserves as a precaution. That’s because the data doesn’t show up overnight. Claims have to trickle in, and only then do the spending patterns start to come into focus. But once the data stabilizes and trends are better understood, the financial impact should become more predictable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the revenue side, the company’s core specialty technology and services business is still performing well. Customer renewals remain very strong at over 98%, and the company's also winning some new business. However, these gains are more than canceled out by a decline in exchange membership, which is directly connected to the One Big Beautiful Bill.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Essentially, the law’s changes to subsidies and insurance risk pools have led companies to reduce how much they participate in the market. In turn, some of Evolent’s larger customers are experiencing membership declines of 40 to 60%. Early data from clients supports management’s cautious outlook on this issue. As the American Medical Association <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/health-care-advocacy/federal-advocacy/4-big-beautiful-bill-changes-will-reshape-care-2026\" rel=\"nofollow\">explained</a> in December, the bill makes the enrollment period shorter and increases costs for many people who buy insurance through the marketplace. This is causing more people to drop their coverage. At the same time, the types of patients and insurance plans remaining in the system are changing. Nevertheless, this shift is putting additional pressure on revenue stability in the near term.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, careful cost control is helping to offset some of the pressure. Par for the course these days, the company has used AI-driven automation tools, including those gained from the <a href=\"https://ir.evolent.com/2024-06-04-Evolent-signs-agreement-to-acquire-artificial-intelligence-utilization-management-products-and-team-from-Machinify\" rel=\"nofollow\">Machinify acquisition</a>, and has made targeted workforce reductions. And it's performing as intended since it produced savings that were higher than originally expected. Those gains should show up more clearly as the year goes on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47303334-17721142206600053_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1954\" data-height=\"1080\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/47303334-17721142206600053_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Evolent Health, Inc.

The company’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EVH/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a> got stronger because it generated solid cash and previously sold off part of the business. Also, net debt finished lower than expected, and there’s nothing coming due anytime soon.

Consensus forecasts the forward P/E collapsing from 15.81 this year to 6.57 for the next and 4.26 by 2028 as EPS grows over 120% then 140%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regardless, the leverage leaves much to be desired. It remains high with long-term debt to capital at an uncomfortable 69% (per FG above) and EV is still $1.31 billion. Remember, cash flow stays limited this year while the business digests <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874213-evolent-health-inc-evh-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">$900 million</a> in new Performance Suite contracts and builds conservative reserves. And if the expected increase in EBITDA later in the year is delayed, or if exchange membership declines further because of the regulatory changes, the company’s financial position could become strained quickly.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Buy</em>. Evolent looks like an unusually attractive opportunity right now, significantly better than when I covered it over a year ago. If the expected second-half ramp happens and the MER (medical expense ratio) discipline holds, EPS should grow significantly. Because of that upside potential, aggressive growth investors may want to buy the stock here.</p>",

I am also positive on its future revenue levers.</p> <p>My prior <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4675689-ccc-intelligent-positive-short-term-and-long-term-growth-expectations\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4675689-ccc-intelligent-positive-short-term-and-long-term-growth-expectations\" target=\"_blank\">March 4, 2024 write-up</a> highlighted its promising growth trajectory for the immediate<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and distant future.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating Profitability Surprised To The Upside </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CCC released its latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/169270850\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/169270850\" target=\"_blank\">financials </a>on Tuesday, Feb 24. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The firm's Oct-Dec '25 EBITDA was 11.7% higher year-on-year at $119 million. As per S&amp;P Capital IQ, that was 7.6% ahead of the consensus projection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was also better than 3Q2025's and 4Q2024's growth rates of +8.4% and +6.3%, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, margin expansion made a bigger contribution to CCC's outperformance than top-line increases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Turnover for the group rose 12.7% to $0.28 billion in the recent three-month period. This is on par with the preceding quarter's +12.0% rise. The revenue beat was also an insignificant 0.9%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see the company taking multiple actions to boost its operational profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It lifted the proportion of subscription-related sales from <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835449-ccc-intelligent-solutions-holdings-inc-cccs-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835449-ccc-intelligent-solutions-holdings-inc-cccs-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">\"80% plus\"</a> in 3Q25 to the mid-80s for 4Q25. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874211-ccc-intelligent-solutions-holdings-inc-ccc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874211-ccc-intelligent-solutions-holdings-inc-ccc-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">analyst briefing</a>, CCC indicated that it has \"been moving clients from transactional-based arrangements to subscription contracts on renewal.\" The latter boasts \"strong EBITDA margins,\" according to management. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It has worked hard at enhancing its productivity. Staffing levels were held steady compared to a year ago despite increased revenues. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, the \"Stock Based Compensation/SBC\" to sales declined to a more comfortable 12% in 4Q2025. This metric was in the mid-to-high teens for the previous two quarters. CCC has become more efficient in executing on the employee compensation program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's progressing well with the assimilation of a key Jan '25 acquisition too. This helped to mitigate the post-transaction earnings drag.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The enterprise's earnings call commentary drew attention to the M&amp;A deal involving \"EvolutionIQ/EIQ, a pioneer in AI claims guidance and the leader in bodily injury claims resolution.\" It also emphasized that EIQ's losses \"will continue to moderate\" as \"we further integrate the business.\" </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that CCC's efforts have paid off. Its reported Q4 EBITDA-to-revenue of 42.7% was 270bps above the sell-side's estimate. The FY25 ratio excluding EIQ's effects expanded 2ppts on a YoY basis. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors clearly liked its strong quarterly showing. The stock price jumped 25% on Wednesday, the next trading day following its Q4 announcement.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Anticipating A Faster Pace Of Core Topline Expansion </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CCC has guided that its \"organic growth\" will improve from 4Q25's +8% to FY2026's +9% based on its results meeting disclosures. It explained that \"the acquisition of EvolutionIQ\" is \"anniversaried\" starting this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My take is that this encouraging full-year outlook is achievable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earlier, the group took part in Citigroup's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/C\" title=\"Citigroup Inc.\">C</a>) \"<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4819432-ccc-intelligent-solutions-holdings-inc-cccs-presents-at-citis-2025-global-technology-media\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4819432-ccc-intelligent-solutions-holdings-inc-cccs-presents-at-citis-2025-global-technology-media\" target=\"_blank\">Global TMT Conference</a>\" on Sep 4, 2025. At that event, it noted the addition of EIQ will enable it to penetrate \"new adjacent markets like workers' comp and disability.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A meaningful 5.5ppts of CCC's 4Q2025 turnover increase was driven by cross-selling. I expect this favorable momentum to be sustained thanks to its new acquiree. The quarterly call commentary revealed that it \"cross-sold EvolutionIQ's workers' compensation offering to an existing CCC customer for the first time.\" </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sector-specific headwinds appear to be receding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CCC shared at the earnings briefing that the \"industry claim volume decline continued to moderate throughout the year.\" It is consistent with management's view that the trend of a \"decline in claim frequency\" will eventually be offset by a higher degree of \"severity and complexity.\" This is also evidenced by a modest low-single-digit decrease in industry-wide claims for 4Q25 on a normalized basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking beyond '26, my bet is on its sales CAGR accelerating further to 11% in the long haul. I've identified indicators suggesting that CCC is still in the early innings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company defined its \"emerging solutions\" segment as one offering \"subrogation, diagnostics\" services at a Goldman Sachs (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GS\" title=\"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\">GS</a>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821742-ccc-intelligent-solutions-holdings-inc-cccs-presents-at-goldman-sachs-communacopia-technology\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821742-ccc-intelligent-solutions-holdings-inc-cccs-presents-at-goldman-sachs-communacopia-technology\" target=\"_blank\">investor event</a>. These ancillary revenues surged +75% YoY in 4Q2025. But that was just five percent of the group-wide figure. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Separately, CCC mentioned at Citi's TMT forum that \"a top 10 carrier has adopted and put about 20% of their claim volume\" through its \"flagship AI product Estimate-STP.\" You would think that the firm's 10% AI-related revenue share could increase going forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">You Should Consider These Downside Factors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A failure to maintain cost discipline could lead to CCC's future margins missing the analysts' expectations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A lower-than-anticipated level of emerging/AI product penetration may pose risks to the company's long-term growth ambitions. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">My Closing Remarks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I've kept this stock as a \"Buy\"-rated name.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its listed comparables include SS&amp;C (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNC\" title=\"SS&amp;C Technologies Holdings, Inc.\">SSNC</a>), HealthEquity (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HQY\" title=\"HealthEquity, Inc.\">HQY</a>), nCino (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NCNO\" title=\"nCino, Inc.\">NCNO</a>), and Veeva (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VEEV\" title=\"Veeva Systems Inc.\">VEEV</a>). The mean EV/EBITDA for these equities is 12.2 times as per S&amp;P Capital IQ.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CCC's forward EBITDA multiple is 9.5x. This implies a re-rating potential of +28% (12.2/9.5) benchmarked with peers.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I take the view that a more rapid rate of turnover expansion will be the catalyst to justify a richer valuation.</p>",

This report was highly anticipated, as the company was expected to provide guidance for the current year—which it did, while also revealing plans to add a staggering nine<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> new data centers in the coming years.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this report, I was primarily focused on several key points:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>To what extent did the company beat (or miss) its 2025 ARR guidance?</p></li> <li><p>Would the 2026 ARR guidance change, and what would be the revenue outlook for 2026?</p></li> <li><p>Would the company provide capital expenditure guidance for 2026?</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I received answers to these questions and, as usual, updated my expectations for the company's future performance and valuation. Looking ahead, I must note that despite a slight reduction in my price target—largely due to my conservative valuation approach—I have become even more bullish on the company's prospects. But let’s take it step by step, starting with the Q4 2025 results.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Review of the Q4 '25 Results</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue and ARR</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Starting with revenue, it fell short of the consensus estimate. With actual Q4 25 revenue at $227.7 million and $529.8 million for the full year 2025, the company missed the consensus forecast of $242.8 million for Q4. However, as I have noted before, due to the small number of investment houses covering the company, the consensus remains unrepresentative and is best ignored for now. Contrary to my expectations, no major investment houses other than Morgan Stanley have initiated coverage since my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">last column</a>. Furthermore, I have reservations regarding Morgan Stanley's report, particularly as it fails to account for Nebius's stakes in its portfolio companies. But let’s look at the hard numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nebius AI accounted for $214.2 million in revenue (94% of total Nebius Group revenue), up 800% year-over-year. For comparison, Nebius AI’s Q3 25 revenue was $131.1 million. The remaining 6% of Group revenue came from TripleTen, while Avride’s contribution was negligible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the full year 2025, the company generated $529.8 million in total revenue, with the Nebius AI business contributing $477.3 million. In my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">previous article</a>, I expected $551 million in revenue (and $248 million for Q4), while the actual Q4 figure for Nebius AI was $214.2 million. However, I don't see this discrepancy as a major issue. Revenue figures are highly sensitive to the timing of new capacity commissions. In the Q4 results, it is far more effective to look at the December ARR, as major capacities only began generating revenue in December.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regarding ARR, the company exceeded its own guidance: against a forecast of $0.9–$1.1 billion, the actual figure (December revenue multiplied by 12) came in at $1.25 billion, implying December revenue of $104 million. This reinforces my view that Arkady Volozh and his team take a conservative approach to forecasting, increasing the likelihood that the December 2026 ARR guidance will also be surpassed. It’s also worth noting the rapid growth: September ARR was $551 million. For comparison, here is the ARR progression previously disclosed by Nebius:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>December 2025 ARR: $1.25 billion</p></li> <li><p>September 2025 ARR: $551 million</p></li> <li><p>June 2025 ARR: $430 million</p></li> <li><p>April 2025 ARR: $310 million</p></li> <li><p>March 2025 ARR: $249 million</p></li> <li><p>December 2024 ARR: $90 million</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company also noted that Active Capacity (power consumed by IT equipment, which I interpret as installed capacity) reached 170 MW by year-end, significantly beating the 100 MW guidance. It is likely that all 75 MW in Finland became active by year-end, which is plausible given that the second part of the Meta contract capacity was delivered by early February. I also assume the Kansas City data center was expanded to 20 MW. My breakdown of the 170 MW active capacity is as follows:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Finland: 75 MW</p></li> <li><p>New Jersey: 50 MW</p></li> <li><p>Kansas City: 20 MW</p></li> <li><p>Iceland: 10 MW</p></li> <li><p>Paris: 5 MW</p></li> <li><p>London: 5 MW</p></li> <li><p>Israel: 5 MW</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is little point in calculating revenue per 1 MW based on December alone, as not all 170 MW of active capacity began generating revenue that month (at the very least, the second 25 MW of the Meta contract did not). Some units may have only been active for a fraction of the month. However, if we take the September revenue-per-MW figure of $0.918 million, it suggests that once the full 170 MW of active capacity is fully ramped up, it could generate an ARR of at least $1.87 billion. We should see this level reflected in the February ARR, as the second half of the Meta contract revenue began flowing in February.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">EBITDA, EBIT, CapEx, and FCF</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the first time, the company’s total Adjusted EBITDA turned positive, reaching $15 million (a 7% margin). If you attempt to calculate Adjusted EBITDA yourself, it is important to note that this $15 million figure is adjusted for one-time non-recurring expenses in SG&amp;A amounting to $43.6 million. I found no specific data on the nature of these expenses or which segment they should be allocated to.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the Nebius AI segment, Adj. EBITDA was $51.8 million, representing a 24% margin (up from 19% in the previous quarter). The overall group margin remains lower than the AI Cloud segment due to the negative profitability of TripleTen and Avride.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we allocate all depreciation and amortization to Nebius AI, the segment's operating loss would stand at $128.9 million. However, given the aggressive growth phase, I would not focus on this metric for the current or even the following year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capital expenditures in Q4 '25 were lower than both <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">my</a> and management’s expectations. Against a $3 billion forecast, actual spending was $2.06 billion. We can conclude that a portion of the CapEx has been deferred to the current year, which is reflected in management’s updated guidance that we will analyze later.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Free Cash Flow loss for the quarter was $1.2 billion. Notably, a portion of the cash flow came from working capital—specifically, prepayments from contracts with Meta and Microsoft. This is evident in the deferred revenue (both short-term and long-term), which increased by $1.56 billion during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, total liquidity stood at $3.7 billion at year-end. It is worth noting that the ATM (At-The-Market) program for the sale of 25 million shares, announced in the previous report, was not utilized. I assume that in the absence of an urgent need for liquidity, the company is waiting for higher share price levels before tapping into this program.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2026 Forecast</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue and ARR Outlook</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To recap, in the previous earnings report, the company provided a December 2026 ARR guidance of $7–$9 billion. This implies December 2026 monthly revenue of $583–$750 million ($667 million at the midpoint). Meanwhile, the company maintained its previously issued guidance for Connected Capacity of 800–1,000 MW by year-end. It is important to distinguish \"Connected\" from \"Active\" capacity; in Nebius's terminology, Connected Capacity refers to power successfully connected to the data centers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we use the revenue-per-MW from the Meta contract as a benchmark (~$0.967 million), the company would need 603–776 MW of revenue-generating capacity by December 2026 to hit the $583–$750 million monthly revenue target. However, there is a high probability that average revenue-per-MW will be higher by December due to a larger share of on-demand rentals and the increased performance density of new GPUs—particularly the Rubin GPUs—expected to be deployed in the second half of 2026. Consequently, the company may require less physical capacity to meet its financial targets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">previous article</a>, I noted that the seven existing data centers would provide a combined 455 MW by year-end, leaving a gap of 235 MW. Given the plans for new capacity, the company is well-positioned to meet its guidance, assuming no significant delays in data center launches.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, management provided its first FY 2026 revenue guidance, projecting $3.0–$3.4 billion. While this is slightly below <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">my expectation</a> of $3.6 billion, I believe management is simply being conservative in their outlook.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability &amp; Capital Expenditures</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management expects Adjusted EBITDA for FY 2026 to settle at approximately 40%, which, based on their revenue guidance, translates to $1.2–$1.36 billion. While operating profit is expected to remain negative for the year, the company reaffirmed its long-term target of 20–30% operating margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nebius has shifted to a 5-year depreciation schedule for GPUs, a move that should accelerate the path to GAAP operating profitability. This is a well-founded decision. Previously, the company used a 4-year schedule, but given that the lion's share of revenue this year and next will come from 5-year contracts with Meta and Microsoft, the adjustment is justified. Notably, this policy remains more conservative than that of Big Tech peers or CoreWeave, who depreciate server hardware over 6 years—a practice that carries the risk of negative revaluations once those 5-year leases expire.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Due to the aggressive data center expansion plans, the CapEx guidance came in higher than my estimates. Management anticipates $16–$20 billion in capital expenditures for FY 2026, compared to my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">previous estimate</a> of $12.8 billion. The company <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9_O3-C0F3c\" rel=\"nofollow\">noted</a> that 60% of this will be covered by existing cash, operational cash flow, and customer prepayments.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">My Updated Data Center Capacity Forecast</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nebius raised its Contracted Capacity guidance for year-end from 2.5 GW to 3 GW. As a reminder, \"Contracted\" refers to capacity where land and power agreements are fully secured—much of this will come online post-2026. A more immediate metric for investors is the Active Capacity guidance of 800–1,000 MW by the end of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s break down the projected capacity by site, starting with current locations and moving to the newly announced data centers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on the earnings call, both tranches of capacity under the Meta contract are already leased. Assuming these are located in the Finnish data center, its capacity has already reached 75 MW. I also expect the London site (Surrey) to expand to its declared 16 MW in Q1 26 and the Modi’in site (Israel) to reach 10 MW this year. Paris (5 MW) and Keflavik (10 MW) should remain stable, while Kansas City is likely to expand to 40 MW by year-end. For the New Jersey site, I expect an additional 50 MW in Q2 26, with the remaining 200 MW coming online late in the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My year-end expectations for existing sites (Total: 456 MW):</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>New Jersey (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>): 300 MW</p></li> <li><p>Mäntsälä (Finland): 75 MW</p></li> <li><p>Kansas City (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USA\" title=\"Liberty All-Star Equity Fund\">USA</a>): 40 MW</p></li> <li><p>Surrey (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UK\" title=\"Ucommune International Ltd\">UK</a>): 16 MW</p></li> <li><p>Keflavik (Iceland): 10 MW</p></li> <li><p>Modi’in (Israel): 10 MW</p></li> <li><p>Paris (France): 5 MW</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Expansion: 9 New Locations</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data on the new sites is scarce, but based on the <a href=\"https://assets.nebius.com/assets/85571bd2-050b-468c-954c-42e9d24e4cd2/Letter%20to%20Shareholders%20Q4%202025.pdf?cache-buster=2026-02-12T11:57:13.886Z\" rel=\"noopener\">Shareholder Letter</a> and industry sources like <em>DataCenterDynamics</em>, I estimate the following:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Independence, Missouri (Owned): <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/nebius-plans-800mw-data-center-campus-in-kansas-city-missouri/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Planned</a> for 800 MW (expandable to 1.1 GW).

Conservatively, I assume 567 MW will be revenue-generating across the full Q4 26.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <td><strong>Period</strong></td> <td><strong>Active Capacity (Installed)</strong></td> <td><strong>Revenue-Generating Capacity</strong></td> </tr></thead> <tr> <td><span><strong>End of 2026</strong></span></td> <td><span>907 MW</span></td> <td><span>567 MW</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span><strong>End of 2027</strong></span></td> <td><span>1.6 GW</span></td> <td><span>1.08 GW</span></td> </tr> <tr> <td><span><strong>End of 2028</strong></span></td> <td><span>2.5 GW</span></td> <td><span>2.0 GW</span></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: Created by the author using his own estimates</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect the company to reach and exceed its 3 GW contracted capacity target by 2029.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While my revenue-generating capacity estimates for 2026–2027 remain largely stable, the outlook for 2028 has shifted significantly upward. The increase in total installed capacity across the board is the primary driver for my upward revision of the CapEx forecast.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">CapEx Forecast</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a reminder, my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">previous estimates</a> for capital expenditures were $12.8 billion for 2026, $11.0 billion for 2027, and $11.9 billion for 2028, totaling $35.7 billion. However, following the updated guidance on new data center additions, I have revised my projections. I now expect CapEx to reach $16.5 billion in 2026, another $16.5 billion in 2027, and $21.5 billion in 2028.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This brings the three-year total to a staggering $54.5 billion. Such a colossal figure immediately raises the question of where the funding will come from. To address this, I will first present my updated forecasts for revenue, operating income, and EBITDA to determine how much internal cash flow the company can generate over this period.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue, Operating Income, and EBITDA Forecast</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My revenue forecast splits Nebius’ revenue into:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Revenue from Microsoft and Meta fixed-price GPU contracts.</p></li> <li><p>Revenue from flexible-priced GPU capacity, where hourly rates and utilization vary.</p></li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For data centers with capacity exceeding 100 MW, I expect them to be reserved for large-scale fixed contracts. For the rest of the data center capacity, hourly pricing ranges from $1.6 to $7, while GPU utilization ranges from 40% to 85%, depending on the GPU model. In future years, I also expect GPU rental rates to decline 3–10% per quarter (depending on the GPU model) to remain conservative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on these assumptions, my revenue forecast is:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>2026: $3.6 billion (+574% YoY) — unchanged</p></li> <li><p>2027: $10.3 billion (+187% YoY) — previously $10.1 billion</p></li> <li><p>2028: $16.5 billion (+60% YoY) — previously $13.5 billion</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/29957065-1772023515901673_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"840\" data-height=\"446\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/29957065-1772023515901673_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"My Nebius AI's Revenue forecast\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/29957065-1772023515901673_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/29957065-1772023515901673_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/29957065-1772023515901673_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/29957065-1772023515901673_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">My Nebius AI's Revenue forecast <span>(Created by the author using his own estimates)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An additional upside to this forecast lies in the PaaS (Token Factory) and SaaS segments. However, until the company begins to break these out separately, I am excluding them from my projections to remain conservative.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Adjusted Operating Income and Adj. EBITDA</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving to operating income, I expect:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>For 2026, I expect an adjusted operating loss of $178 million (previously a loss of $374 million). This improvement is due to the shift in GPU depreciation from 4 to 5 years, which partially offset the upward revision in CapEx. I still expect the company to reach positive adjusted operating income in Q4 2026.</p></li> <li><p>For the full year 2027, I expect $2.2 billion in operating profit (previously $2.3 billion) with a 22% margin.</p></li> <li><p>For 2028, I expect $4.1 billion in operating profit (previously $3.3 billion) with a 25% margin.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My expectations for adjusted EBITDA:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>2025: -$74 million (previously –$98 million)</p></li> <li><p>2026: $1.5 billion (previously +$1.67 billion)</p></li> <li><p>2027: $6.5 billion (previously +$7.0 billion)</p></li> <li><p>2028: $10.6 billion (previously +$9.8 billion)</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having established forecasts for revenue, adj. EBIT, and adj. EBITDA, we now move to estimating Nebius’ external funding needs through 2028.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additional Funding Requirements</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, let’s look at the funding needs for 2026. Starting with $3.7 billion in liquidity at the end of Q4 '25, the company is expected to generate $1.5 billion in EBITDA during 2026. Based on my estimates, interest payments will consume $264 million, while CapEx will require $16.5 billion. This leaves a funding gap of $11.6 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">previous analysis</a>, I took a conservative stance and did not model prepayments from Meta and Microsoft. However, following the actual cash inflows in Q4 '25, I am now incorporating the projected cash flow from customer prepayments into my 2026 forecast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To estimate the remaining prepayments due this year, we can look at the $1.5 billion already received. Considering that all 50 MW for Meta and the initial 50 MW for Microsoft have been delivered, Nebius still has 250 MW to deliver to Microsoft. Based on these inputs, the $1.5 billion represents a portion of the $2.9 billion Meta contract and roughly $2.9 billion of the $17.4 billion Microsoft contract. This implies a prepayment rate of approximately 26% (which I will round down to 25% for conservatism).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that the remaining 250 MW for Microsoft is slated for delivery this year, the remaining prepayment should amount to roughly $3.6 billion. Consequently, to cover my projected expenses through the end of the year, the company will need to raise an additional $8 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9_O3-C0F3c\" rel=\"nofollow\">earnings call</a>, management repeatedly emphasized that 60% of CapEx would be funded through existing liquidity, operational cash flow, and prepayments. Using management’s 40% EBITDA margin and the midpoint of their revenue guidance, these sources would provide $8.68 billion. Meanwhile, 60% of their lower-bound CapEx guidance is $9.6 billion, suggesting a gap of roughly $900 million. I expect this shortfall to be covered either by other working capital components or by prepayments from yet-to-be-announced contracts, which I anticipate no earlier than the end of Q2 '26.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">How can Nebius bridge my projected funding gap? The company has several levers. The 25 million shares ATM program remains untouched. At a share price of $100, this alone covers a significant portion. Additionally, Nebius could monetize parts of its stakes in ClickHouse and Avride.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the longer-term horizon from Q1 '26 through Q4 '28, the company will require $54.5 billion in CapEx.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Between Q1 '26 and Q4 '28, I estimate the company will generate:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>$18.6 billion in EBITDA</p></li> <li><p>$0.409 billion in taxes</p></li> <li><p>$3.3 billion in interest payments</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The elevated interest estimate requires explanation. The existing four convertible bond issues imply only $253 million of interest over this period. However, to stay conservative, I model the entire capital shortfall as debt at a 9% interest rate—benchmarked against the rate CoreWeave<strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWV\" title=\"CoreWeave, Inc.\">CRWV</a>)</strong> pays on its latest asset-backed financing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Nebius has many financing options (selling stakes in ClickHouse, Avride, or Toloka; issuing new convertible bonds or equity), I am modeling this conservative debt-heavy scenario until more clarity emerges. Under these assumptions, the company will require $34.5 billion of additional capital during 2026–2028:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>$9 billion in 2026 (including a buffer for 2027)</p></li> <li><p>$11 billion in 2027</p></li> <li><p>$14.5 billion in 2028</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are substantial figures, but I have little doubt that Nebius can secure this funding, especially given the diversity of available financing tools. It is important to note that this $34.5 billion is not a fixed obligation—it is a discretionary growth spend that can be adjusted based on market conditions and demand. In the near term, I expect Nebius to secure asset-backed financing specifically against the high-quality cash flows of the Microsoft contract.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, we move to valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nebius AI’s Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">previous analysis</a>, I valued Nebius using the EV/EBIT multiple, taking the 2028 adjusted operating profit as the denominator. I believe EV/EBIT is a more robust metric here than EV/EBITDA because it does not artificially inflate the valuation. Instead, it accounts for capital intensity and reflects differences in depreciation as a percentage of revenue, which directly impacts FCF profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current average forward EV/EBIT'28 multiple for the peer group (Amazon, Oracle, Alphabet, and Microsoft) is 13.5x (down from 15.9x at the time of my last article).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Applying this 13.5x multiple to my updated 2028 adjusted operating profit forecast of $4.1 billion, I arrive at a fair Enterprise Value for Nebius AI of $55.7 billion (up from my previous estimate of $52.7 billion). The decline in peer multiples was more than offset by the upward revision in my operating profit forecast, which, as noted, was partly driven by the change in depreciation policy. It is worth noting that if we adjusted peer multiples to match Nebius’s more conservative 5-year depreciation (vs. their 6-year schedules), their multiples would effectively be higher. However, I will stick with the current 13.5x to remain conservative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To derive the fair Equity Value, we must subtract net debt. Rather than using the current figure ($450 million), I factor in the future capital required to achieve the projected 2028 financials. My model estimates this funding need at $34.5 billion. When discounted to the present, this represents a present value of $29.8 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I treat the outstanding convertible notes as additional shares rather than debt, as the current share price significantly exceeds the conversion price. Consequently, I subtract the projected capital raise ($29.8 billion) from the Enterprise Value. This results in an Equity Value for Nebius AI of $27.4 billion (previously $34.5 billion). The decrease in equity value is primarily due to the higher debt assumptions I’ve integrated into the model to maintain a conservative stance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fully Diluted Share Count</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of Q4 '25, Nebius has 219.5 million Class A shares and 33.6 million Class B shares. To determine the fully diluted count, I add:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>19.4 million shares from the 2029 and 2031 convertible notes.</p></li> <li><p>7.4 million shares from stock options (exercise price: $88.15).</p></li> <li><p>6.2 million shares from RSUs (average exercise price: $43.74).</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Note: The figures for options and RSUs are based on data from the ATM program announcement, but I assume they have not changed materially.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Total Fully Diluted Shares: 286 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on this share count, the core Nebius AI business is valued at $95.7 per share. This is remarkably close to the current market valuation and, crucially, does not yet include the valuation of Nebius’s other business segments or its stakes in Toloka and ClickHouse.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Avride, TripleTen, and Stakes in Toloka and ClickHouse</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this article, I will not revalue Nebius’s holdings in Avride ($4.8 billion) or Toloka ($0.64 billion). I intend to cover these in separate articles, as both businesses deserve a deep dive of their own.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I am updating my valuations for ClickHouse and TripleTen. Notably, ClickHouse <a href=\"https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-raises-400-million-series-d-acquires-langfuse-launches-postgres\" rel=\"nofollow\">raised</a> a new $400 million funding round in January at a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-16/clickhouse-lands-15-billion-valuation-in-ai-database-race\" rel=\"nofollow\">$15 billion valuation</a>. Prior to this round, Nebius held a 28% stake. While I initially estimated a dilution to 27%, management clarified during the earnings call that Nebius now holds a 25% stake.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will use this updated figure, which values Nebius’s stake in ClickHouse at $3.75 billion. Given ClickHouse’s growth trajectory, I believe this holding has further upside potential; therefore, I am including it in my valuation without a liquidity discount for its private status.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am also updating my valuation for TripleTen. Previously, I used an average EV/Sales'25 multiple of 2.9x from a peer group consisting of Coursera, Udemy, and Duolingo. I have since adjusted my approach. Given Duolingo’s recent price correction, I am now using its current EV/Sales'26 multiple of 3.77x as the primary benchmark for TripleTen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TripleTen's business grew 88% YoY in 2025 to $52.5 million. Taking a lack of specific revenue guidance for TripleTen this year, I expect at least 50% growth in 2026, reaching $78.8 million. At a 3.77x multiple, this yields a fair value for TripleTen of $297 million (up from $267 million).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts &amp; Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By combining the updated valuations for Nebius AI, TripleTen, and ClickHouse while keeping Avride and Toloka unchanged, I arrive at a fair equity value for Nebius Group of $36.9 billion (previously $42 billion). This corresponds to a fair value of $128.9 per share based on the diluted share count of 286 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As noted earlier, the decrease in target price is driven by the compression of peer multiples and my more conservative assumptions regarding the capital required over the next few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sum-of-the-Parts Valuation Breakdown:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Nebius AI: $27.4 billion ($95.70 per share)</p></li> <li><p>ClickHouse Stake: $3.75 billion ($13.10 per share)</p></li> <li><p>Avride: $4.8 billion ($16.80 per share)</p></li> <li><p>Toloka Stake: $0.64 billion ($2.24 per share)</p></li> <li><p>TripleTen: $0.3 billion ($1.04 per share)</p></li> <li><p>Total Fair Value: $128.90 per share</p></li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Verdict</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the slight reduction in my fair value estimate, I have become even more bullish on Nebius. Even under a highly conservative financing scenario, the current share price offers significant upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Several factors provide further upside potential to my valuation:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Cheaper Financing: My model assumes a 9% interest rate on debt. Any asset-backed financing or customer prepayments from newly announced data centers would lower this cost.</p></li> <li><p>Strategic Milestones: I expect major contract announcements around the launch of the Bethune (France) facility this summer and the Alabama site toward year-end, which should serve as strong catalysts.</p></li> <li><p>Conservative Multiples: Valuing the business on 2028 EBIT is conservative, as Nebius is likely to maintain a higher growth rate than its Big Tech peers well beyond 2028. Also, a part of the 2028 CapEx will generate revenue only in 2029.</p></li> </ol> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I mentioned in my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4845220-nebius-valuation-update-after-q3-results-raising-price-target-to-147\">previous column</a>, I have fully rebuilt my initial position in Nebius. In early February, I increased my position by another 10% after the stock dipped below $75. I do not plan to sell any shares until the price reaches at least $130 without additional news.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, while my fair value estimate moved from $147 to $129, my conviction in the company’s prospects has only strengthened due to their successful operational execution. It is also important to note that my estimate represents current fair value, rather than a 12-month price target used by most analysts.</p>",

Their current valuation, however, suggests prospects are mostly<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> baked in.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business context</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens is organized into four main business segments:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Digital Industries: This segment offers product and system solutions for factory automation, including factory automation software such as TIA (Totally Integration Automation), motors, drives, inverters, sensors, product lifecycle management software (PLM) such as Teamcenter, electronic design automation software (EDA), as well as digital marketplaces for electronics such as Supplyframe and Pixeom. Industries served include consumer packaged goods, semiconductors, automotive, and pharmaceuticals, and their customers include <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAY21NZ9JNE&amp;t=653s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Micron</a>, Intel, and Rapidus, to name a few.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens competitors in this space include Rockwell Automation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROK\" title=\"Rockwell Automation, Inc.\">ROK</a>), ABB (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABBNY\" title=\"ABB Ltd\">ABBNY</a>), and Schneider Electric (factory automation software) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBGSF\" title=\"Schneider Electric S.E.\">SBGSF</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBGSY\" title=\"Schneider Electric S.E.\">SBGSY</a>), Dassault (PLM) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DASTY\" title=\"Dassault Systèmes SE\">DASTY</a>), Cadence Design Systems (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CDNS\" title=\"Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\">CDNS</a>) and Altium (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALMFF\" title=\"Altium Limited\">ALMFF</a>) to name just a few, and Siemens is consistently among the top players in several of these segments including <a href=\"https://www.abiresearch.com/press/ptc-siemens-and-dassault-systemes-take-the-lead-in-abi-researchs-plm-for-large-manufacturers-competitive-ranking\" rel=\"nofollow\">PLM</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ema-eda.com/ema-resources/blog/top-eda-companies/\" rel=\"nofollow\">EDA</a>, and <a href=\"https://manufacturingdigital.com/ai-and-automation/top-10-industrial-automation-software-companies\" rel=\"nofollow\">factory automation</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of Q1 2026, Digital Industries is their second-biggest segment accounting for roughly a fifth or so of revenues. The segment generates revenues through two major streams, namely, software (which accounts for roughly a third of Digital Industries’ revenues) and automation, which accounts for the remainder. Margins typically hover in the high teens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Smart Infrastructure: This segment offers products and system solutions to support the shift in energy generation from fossils to renewables. Products and solutions include EV charging infrastructure; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning controls, distribution systems, and switchgear including <a href=\"https://www.siemens.com/en-us/products/vacuum-switching-technology/sion-vacuum-circuit-breakers\" rel=\"nofollow\">circuit breakers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.siemens.com/en-us/products/siprotec/\" rel=\"nofollow\">relays</a> and <a href=\"https://www.siemens.com/en-us/products/sivacon/\" rel=\"nofollow\">busbars</a>. This segment also includes software solutions such as Building X (Building Management System), Gridscale X (grid management), Electrification X (electricity infrastructure management), and Siemens Xcelerator marketplace platform where customers can buy components and software solutions from Siemens and sellers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens competes with a number of competitors in this segment, including Schneider Electric (in BMS and grid management with products like Schneider EcoStruxure), ABB (switchboards, EV charging infrastructure).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of Q1 2026, Smart Infrastructure is Siemens’ biggest revenue generator accounting for over a quarter of revenues. Margins hover in the high teens.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mobility: This segment offers products and services related to rail passenger and freight transportation, including rolling stock, as well as software solutions including rail automation. This is their smallest segment accounting for under a fifth of revenues, and is also the least profitable with the lowest margins. Competitors in this space include Alstom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALSMY\" title=\"Alstom SA\">ALSMY</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AOMFF\" title=\"Alstom SA\">AOMFF</a>) and CRRC (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRCCY\" title=\"CRRC Corporation Limited\">CRCCY</a>)). This segment accounts for under 15% of revenues. Margins are typically in the high single digits, making it one of the least profitable segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens Healthineers: Siemens Healthineers sells medical products and solutions with a particular focus on medical imaging and laboratory diagnostics. Products include MRI scanners, CT scanners, radiography systems, oncology equipment, and analysis equipment for urine analysis, and blood testing, among other purposes. Competitors include GE Healthcare (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GEHC\" title=\"GE HealthCare Technologies Inc.\">GEHC</a>) and Mindray (medical imaging) and Roche (lab diagnostics) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RHHBY\" title=\"Roche Holding AG\">RHHBY</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RHHBF\" title=\"Roche Holding AG\">RHHBF</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RHHVF\" title=\"Roche Holding AG\">RHHVF</a>) and Philips (oncology) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PHG\" title=\"Koninklijke Philips N.V.\">PHG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RYLPF\" title=\"Koninklijke Philips N.V.\">RYLPF</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens currently holds nearly a <a href=\"https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/siemens-plans-deconsolidate-siemens-healthineers\" rel=\"nofollow\">70%</a> stake in Siemens Healthineers. The segment contributes to at least a quarter of Siemens’ revenues, and margins typically hover in the mid teens.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Financial context</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In <a href=\"https://assets.new.siemens.com/siemens/assets/api/uuid:3948cdd4-35e0-4c1d-8412-9aed4097b3d0/HQCOPR202511117277EN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">FY 2025</a>, Siemens’s revenues rose 5%, while orders grew 6% largely driven by Digital Industries. Net income was up 16% to EUR 10.4 billion and free cash flows reached EUR 10.8 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The momentum accelerated in <a href=\"https://assets.new.siemens.com/siemens/assets/api/uuid:958b35dc-9844-4e7f-b30e-eb795d9e74da/HQPR202602097341EN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q1 2026</a> with orders up 10% to EUR 21 billion from EUR 20 billion and revenues up 8% on a comparable basis. Net income was EUR 2.2 billion (compared to EUR 3.9 billion in Q1 2025 which benefited from a EUR 2.1 billion gain from the sale of Innomotics. Free cash flow was EUR 0.7 billion for the quarter. Growth was largely driven by Smart Infrastructure and Digital Industries. Digital Industries orders were up by at least 10% to EUR 4.8 billion from EUR 4.2 billion in Q1 2025, with both the software business and automation business contributing to growth. Smart Infrastructure order growth exceeded 15% reaching EUR 7.1 billion (from EUR 6.1 billion in Q1 2025) largely driven by the electrical products business which included significant orders from data center customers (data center orders reached a record high of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869206-siemens-aktiengesellschaft-siegy-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">EUR 1.8 billion</a> for the quarter). Order backlog hit a record <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869206-siemens-aktiengesellschaft-siegy-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">EUR 120 billion</a> and book-to-bill was <a href=\"https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/strong-start-fiscal-2026-outlook-raised\" rel=\"nofollow\">1.12</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Prospects</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Data center growth engine has room to run and support management growth targets</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens’s growth appears to be largely driven by data center capex spend. This year alone, AI and hyperscalers Amazon (AWS), Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>), Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), and Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) have announced data center capex investments totaling more than <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/06/google-microsoft-meta-amazon-ai-cash.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">USD 700 billion</a> this year (led by Amazon = <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/05/amazon-and-google-are-winning-the-ai-capex-race-but-whats-the-prize/\" rel=\"nofollow\">USD 200 billion</a>, Google = USD 180 billion, Meta = <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/02/06/what-is-a-data-center-capex-spending-630-billion-dollars-amazon-microsoft-google-meta/\" rel=\"nofollow\">USD 135 billion</a>) to win the AI race.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The capex upcycle is likely only the beginning. Estimates indicate that data center capacity could rise by as much as <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/ai-power-expanding-data-center-capacity-to-meet-growing-demand\" rel=\"nofollow\">20%</a> annually over the medium term through 2030 which bodes well for Siemens which has already proven to be a beneficiary. Assuming market share remains unchanged, management’s 6%-9% growth targets therefore appear realistic on the back of booming data center spend near term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Fragmented market and Siemens' strategic positioning supports market share gains and growth prospects</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens appears to be making moves to increase their share of data center capex spend, particularly in the higher-value semiconductor side (which accounts for an estimated <a href=\"https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2785404-alphabet-to-hike-data-center-spending-in-2026\" rel=\"nofollow\">60%</a> of hyperscalers’ planned USD 700 billion capex spend in 2026). Siemens acquisition of Altair Engineering last year bolstered their capabilities in industrial simulation, positioning them as a more competitive vendor for semiconductor clients seeking simulation i.e., <a href=\"https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/siemens-acquires-altair-create-most-complete-ai-powered-portfolio-industrial-software\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">digital twin</a> solutions. This year the momentum continued with the acquisition of <a href=\"https://engineerlive.com/content/siemens-acquires-canopus-ai-help-solve-critical-challenges-semiconductor-manufacturing\" rel=\"nofollow\">Canopus AI</a> which provides metrospection solutions for semiconductor manufacturers to increase yield. Both acquisitions are synergistic, bolstering Siemens’ existing portfolio which could drive organic market share gains; Altair strengthens Siemens' digital twin capabilities by adding advanced mechanical and electromagnetic simulation, while Canopus complements their EDA offering, enabling clients to improve semiconductor production yields.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile Siemens is inking numerous partnerships aimed at carving out a bigger share of the EDA market where Siemens competes with products like Solido and Calibre (the gold standard in integrated circuit physical verification). Siemens formed an alliance with Samsung last year to increase their position in the EDA space (an <a href=\"https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20250716PD242/ip-siemens-synopsys-cadence-samsung.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">oligopoly</a> dominated by Synopsis and Cadence which hold roughly <a href=\"https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-regulation/china-chip-design-620616\" rel=\"nofollow\">30%</a> global share each, far ahead of Siemens’ 13%) and inked a <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/siemens-and-nvidia-expand-partnership-industrial-ai-operating-system\" rel=\"nofollow\">partnership</a> with Nvidia to build an Industrial AI operating system. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These acquisitions and partnerships position Siemens as more than just a provider of hardware components i.e., electricals but also software solutions from grid management to simulation and metrospection, which are becoming increasingly in demand as data center construction and semiconductor development costs increase. Not only could this support topline growth but could be margin accretive as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens secured EUR 1.8 billion in data center related orders in Q1 2026. Assuming order books are built in quarterly stages. At their current run rate I estimate Siemens may possibly rake in as much as EUR 8 billion or so in data center related orders this year. Considering hyperscalers alone are expected to spend as much as USD 700 this year on capex spend, of which roughly <a href=\"https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news-and-insights/latest-market-news/2785404-alphabet-to-hike-data-center-spending-in-2026\" rel=\"noopener\">40%</a> or so is on data center construction itself of which <a href=\"https://www.mastt.com/guide/data-center-construction\" rel=\"nofollow\">50%</a> (or approximately USD 140 billion) is for electricals, suggests Siemens’ market share is likely in the single digits. Rival Schneider Electric, which also captured around <a href=\"https://dcpulse.com/news/schneider-electric-switch-sign-usd-2-3-billion-us-data-centre-deals-for-ai-growth\" rel=\"nofollow\">USD 2 billion</a> in data center related orders, likely holds a roughly similar share or higher reflecting a market that potentially has room for further consolidation as data center construction technical complexities and demands grow. Siemens could be well positioned to increase market share as they differentiate themselves with an expanding and interconnected portfolio which offers a cohesive, and operationally seamless solution compared to fragmented alternatives by competitors. </p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Siemens Healthineers: Dry powder to drive organic and inorganic growth through acquisitions, but much depends on execution</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect Siemens will likely remain acquisitive. Management’s plan to spin-off their stake in Siemens Healthineers could potentially yield EUR 20 billion (<a href=\"https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/siemens-plans-deconsolidate-siemens-healthineers\" rel=\"nofollow\">30%</a> of their 67% stake will be divested directly to shareholders with the remaining 37% likely liquidated through the open market, a stake worth as much as EUR 20 billion based on Siemens Healthineers’ market cap of EUR 47 billion). Management has indicated the funds will be used to further bolster their position across the industrial software and industrial hardware value chain as part of their ONE Tech strategy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the strategy has merits, particularly in terms of improving market positioning, to what extent they could support financial performance remains to be seen; the data center and AI space is in an upswing, and valuations appear demanding. Siemens shelled out around EUR 13 billion on two acquisitions, Altair and Dotmatics, in 2025, at valuations that were arguably on the high side (revenues of the two companies combined are under USD 1 billion) and both have so far had an immaterial contribution to Siemens’ financials. Much depends on management's execution ability to integrate and cross-sell them to their customer base and drive growth industry averages to justify steep valuation premiums paid. So far this has yet to materialize, and therefore any revenue and profit growth arising from acquisitions is considered to be a bull case scenario.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The SaaS evolution: Shift toward a high-margin industrial ecosystem</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens’s overall strategy of focusing on shifting from hardware components to higher margin industrial software and solutions is potentially margin accretive. Their software business currently accounts for an estimated mid single digit share of revenues, so there is ample potential for further expansion of their software business, which they are working towards through efforts like transitioning <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAY21NZ9JNE&amp;t=653s\" rel=\"nofollow\">away </a>from perpetual licenses and towards recurring subscriptions (high switching costs such as data migration and personnel training are likely to keep customers tethered to Siemens). Their cloud business also allows them to tap smaller customers who previously may have been beyond reach due to high costs related to perpetual licenses. Over <a href=\"https://press.siemens.com/global/en/pressrelease/siemens-enters-next-stage-growth-its-one-tech-company-program\" rel=\"nofollow\">90%</a> of their 24,000 SaaS customers are SME.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens’s record EUR 120 billion order book gives some visibility on revenue prospects for the next couple of years or so. The order book comprises a mix of short cycle orders (such as automation products under their Digital Industries segment which are typically produced in under one year), medium cycle (such as data centers which typically take 2-3 years or so), and long-cycle orders (typically from mobility customers which can run into several years). The vast majority of their order book is for short and medium cycle orders (Mobility orders in total are around EUR 15 billion). Coupled with potential new orders for data centers in the coming quarters, as well as orders in other AI-related areas where Siemens is positioned to benefit from due to strong semiconductor demand, management growth targets of 6%-9% looks possible over the next year or two assuming their software business (which generates recurring revenue of several billions notably from software products like Teamcenter X which have sticky users) maintains their double digit growth momentum which is not impossible. After that however I expect data center orders are likely to normalize with little order growth at that point as the cycle plateaus temporarily (data center construction typically takes 1-3 years so current capex spend could feed data center supply as far as 2-3 years from now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming revenues grow at the lower end of management’s projections, i.e., 6% this year and next year, revenues could potentially reach EUR 87 billion by 2027. Assuming margins of 15% (largely consistent with current levels, as significant margin expansion is likely a gradual long term process) suggests net income could be around EUR 13 billion or so. Deducting around EUR 3 billion in deconsolidated segment profit, assuming Siemens successfully disposes of their Siemens Healthineers stake suggests a net income of around EUR 10 billion. Assigning a P/E of 16 (slightly higher than historical averages to account for the ongoing shift to higher margin software businesses as well as Healthineers disposal and subsequent greater penetration into emerging tech like AI and semiconductors, which makes them more of a tech company than an industrial one) translates into a terminal value of EUR 160 billion. Adding EUR 17 billion (being shares shareholders receive from the Siemens Healthineers disposal) means a value of EUR 177 billion (USD 208 billion) for Siemens looks fair. If we tweak the valuation slightly and assign an 18x P/E their valuation could reach EUR 197 billion (USD 232 billion). Not too far from their current market cap of USD 224 billion, suggesting prospects are likely baked in for now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Execution risks</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens is aggressively transitioning toward AI and industrial software, a strategy which includes disposing of their stake in Siemens Healthineers - a stable, almost recession-proof, low-volatility business—to focus on acquiring higher growth industrial software businesses. Industry valuations currently are steep, and Siemens could end up overpaying, resulting in capital destruction due to execution missteps. Their acquisition of Altair (USD 140 million FCF translating into a FCF yield of under 1%) is a case in point. Even if we assume expected USD 150 million EBITDA near term cost savings will flow through FCF, it still translates into a yield of under 3%. Given Siemens WACC of around 10%, Altair would need to annual growth above 30% for at least 6 years or so to generate economic value, which would be quite a feat for the company that notched 9% YoY growth in 2024. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Takeaway</span></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Siemens's share price has enjoyed a good run on the back of solid financial performance largely driven by AI and data center spending. The cycle has further room to run, which could support management's growth projections. Management continues to enhance Siemens' capabilities through acquisitions and partnerships to boost market capabilities, positioning the firm to capture market share, however much remains on their ability to execute and drive tangible financial growth to justify steep valuation premiums. Even after assigning a slightly higher P/E multiple to account for the transition from a traditional industrial conglomerate to a tech-focused industrial software vendor, the current market cap appears to be in line with fair value. Siemens has a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SIEGY/ratings/sell-side-ratings\">BUY</a> analyst consensus rating; however, I view Siemens as a HOLD.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Three months ago, the company reported solid Q3 FY2026 earnings, significantly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524145-nvidia-non-gaap-eps-of-1_30-beats-by-0_04-revenue-of-57b-beats-by-1_91b\">beating all<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> estimates</span></a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">. However, the stock lost upside momentum and has remained flat. Before heading into Q4 FY2026, there were several concerns weighing on the stock's sentiment, including higher input costs, H200 sales in China, fears of AI overspending, increasing competition, and its premium multiple.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846090-nvidia-q3-the-flipside-of-everything-is-sold-out-is-concerning\">last 3Q FY2026 analysis</a>, I maintained a Hold rating on NVDA, citing that too much good news had been priced in. When everyone believes that NVDA is a \"no-brainer\" trade, that overexuberance can become a concern and the stock might take a breather. As we saw, a strong Q3 earnings failed to lift the stock, and a robust <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4524145-nvidia-non-gaap-eps-of-1_30-beats-by-0_04-revenue-of-57b-beats-by-1_91b\">Q4 earnings</a> also failed to reignite the hype. The stock briefly popped more than 3% but later reversed all the gains. Some argued that it could be due to higher inventory buildup, while others concern that hyperscalers are building out their own data centers, raising questions about NVDA's long-term growth sustainability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, the stock's 10 months range-bound move is a de-valuation process, and I believe this process is now complete. The non-GAAP P/E fwd has compressed to 24x, down from 41x in 10 months ago (because non-GAAP forward 12-month EPS consensus has improved significantly while the stock price remained flat). Most importantly, management guided that data center revenue will accelerate on a QoQ basis throughout FY2027, and gross margin will sustain in the mid-70s. Therefore, I believe this Q4 post-earnings pullback could be a buying opportunity.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">\"Sequential Revenue Growth Throughout Calendar 2026\" (FY2027)</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720618828124783.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The company model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"626\" height=\"398\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720618828124783.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720618828124783.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720618828124783.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The company model</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20314563-nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2026#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">Q4 earnings</a>, NVDA had rallied 13% from the February low and is now hovering near all-time highs, so the technical resistance could be hard to break through. It was also likely that investors had already priced in robust Q4 results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like prior quarters, the company once again topped all the estimates by a wide margin. As shown in the chart above, Datacenter revenue YoY growth has maintained a \"V-shaped\" rebound since 2Q FY2026. Considering the 1Q FY2027 midpoint revenue guidance, the total revenue growth will accelerate further to $78 billion, up 77% YoY. I assumed Datacenter revenue will be 90% of its total revenue in 1Q FY2027, which is 30 bps higher than the FY2025 level. This would imply $70.2 billion in Datacenter revenue in 1Q ($78 billion x 90%), or 79% YoY growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874926-nvidia-corporation-nvda-q4-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a>, CEO Jensen Huang reiterated robust chip demand. He highlighted that the agentic AI inflection has arrived. The company expects \"sequential revenue growth throughout calendar 2026, exceeding what was included in the $500 billion Blackwell and Rubin revenue opportunity we shared last year.\" The Q1 FY2027 revenue outlook suggests a 12.7% QoQ growth. Even assuming a flat 10% sequential growth momentum would imply 70% YoY Datacenter revenue growth for FY2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Keep in mind, forward revenue guidance does not assume any revenue from China. Although the U.S government has approved H200 products for China-based customers, the company hasn't generated any sales so far. They are also not sure when these products will be eventually shipped into China.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gross Margin Concern is Overblown</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720640868036644.png?io=w640\" alt=\"The company model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"571\" height=\"382\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720640868036644.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720640868036644.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49592191-17720640868036644.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The company model</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recently we've seen a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4871168-micron-stock-ddr5-prices-surge-since-september-could-rise-further-2026\">significant price squeeze</a> in HBM and DRAM, up 400% to 500% since September of last year. I was concerned that higher input costs could pressure NVDA's gross margin outlook. However, Q4 FY2026 gross margin continued to expand, driven by increasing Blackwell ramp. Moreover, Q1 FY2027 gross margin is also expected to be resilient at 75%. In the earnings call, management forecasted a \"mid-70s\" gross margin outlook for FY2027. Based on $7.5 billion non-GAAP operating expenses guidance, we can estimate non-GAAP operating margin will be at 65.4% in Q1, slightly down from 67.7% in the previous quarter.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Increasing Competition from Other Players</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, NVDA remains the top leader in the AI chip market in the near to medium term. with tremendous demand for its Blackwell and Rubin chips. However, investor sentiment could still be impacted by fears of increasing competition.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earlier this week, Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2026-2-24-amd-and-meta-announce-expanded-strategic-partnersh.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> that Meta (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) will buy AMD Instinct GPUs to deploy 6 GW of data center begin in 2H 2026. This news initially sent AMD's stock 9% higher. The company also issued performance-based warrants to META for up to $160 million shares of AMD common stock. The AMD's CEO noted that these warrants would only vest if the stock price reaches $600. In addition, major hyperscalers are also aggressively expanding their data center and design their own AI chips. For example, Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) just raised $500 million to develop chips to directly challenge NVDA's dominance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The CEO Jensen warned,</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>\"Our competitors in China bolstered by recent IPOs are making progress and have the potential to disrupt the structure of the global AI industry over the long term.\"</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If NVDA can generate additional revenue from H200 sales to China, it would add a revenue tailwind.

Back in August 2025, non-GAAP P/E fwd was 41x. Since then, the stock has barely moved. I believe that the current 41x of non-GAAP fwd on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/valuation/metrics\">Valuation page</a> has a lag. Based on forward 12-month EPS consensus on the table above (from 1Q FY2027 to 4Q FY2027), NVDA's non-GAAP P/E fwd should be at 24.7x ($196/ $7.94), which justifies an upgrade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA generated $96.6 billion FCF in FY2026, indicating a 44.6% FCF margin. Assuming a flat FCF margin in FY2027, the company is expected to generate $149 billion in FCF in FY2027. So, its P/FCF fwd is at 31.5x. Compared to these hyperscalers that would have negative FCF next year, NVDA's stock demonstrates much better quality.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, the 4Q FY2026 earnings indicated that robust AI demand continues in CY2026. Datacenter revenue (excluding China) will accelerate further into FY2027. Despite higher input costs, gross margin remains resilient. Although I believe long-term growth sustainability remains a major concern for investors due to raising competition, NVDA's fundamentals show no signs of slowing at this stage. From the valuation perspective, the non-GAAP P/E fwd is at 24.7x, which is a bargain (assuming current forward EPS consensus is reliable). Therefore, I believe it's time to turn bullish on NVDA. and I've upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold.</p>",

Whether it was the investment itself or the managers of private equity, we never really saw the risk-reward as well aligned for our tastes. The main reason behind not wanting to chase either<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> class, came down to valuations. For private equity, it was fairly clear that marking these had usually diverged radically from reality. We saw that in 2022 where tech related private equity mark downs were minimal while the NASDAQ and Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 ETF (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 ETF\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">QQQ</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) were down over 20%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, not all forms of private and exotic markets carry the same level of risk. There are some like CLO Equity, which have created the worst returns on the spectrum.

In fact, the numbers were so crazy from the perspective of Oracle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>), that we titled that piece, \"<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4822995-oracle-suspension-of-disbelief\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4822995-oracle-suspension-of-disbelief\" target=\"_blank\">Suspension Of Disbelief</a>\". So if investors are anxious about data centers, we get it. What we don't get is this. </p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_28c0312c26962f18d9b77662f719ea1d.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_28c0312c26962f18d9b77662f719ea1d.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_28c0312c26962f18d9b77662f719ea1d.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_28c0312c26962f18d9b77662f719ea1d.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ORCL has absolutely become a conjoined twin with the fate of its data center bet. But OWL is a different beast (bird?) and has a very different level of exposure. Take for example its deal with (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>). The $27 billion LLM ( we refuse to use \"AI\" for regurgitating, hallucinating software) data center deal is where OWL put up $2.5 billion of equity (not debt) and that is where the angst comes from. This was a unique setup that made the debt of the project (backed by PIMCO and Blackstone) safe, while OWL stands first in line to deal with the bubble fallout. </p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>The debt priced at +225 bps over Treasuries, roughly double the spread on Meta’s own corporate bonds. Yet for insurance investors, the yield looks attractive. They get Meta’s implied credit strength thanks to the RVG, which guarantees the project’s residual value for 16 years without the correlation risk of owning Meta equity.</p> <p>That guarantee, according to S&amp;P, was “the linchpin” that earned the debt its A+ rating. It effectively transfers technology-obsolescence risk (the danger that AI chips age faster than the building) back to Meta.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3464663\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/3464663\" target=\"_blank\">S&amp;P Global </a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason that the debt earns an A+ rating is because META can walk away 4 years after it is operational, but it guarantees a minimum residual value that makes the debt holders, whole. But OWL is not a debt holder here and there in lies the concern. All that said, we find this obsession with OWL's equity funding as rather strange. That is because OWL is NOT funding it. The funds underlying OWL's investment management arm are funding it. The $2.5 billion of equity should be compared to the total AUM, which is now over $300 billion ($185 billion if you count only fee bearing capital). In return for this, the funds likely earn mid-teens return on equity. OWL has other data center deals in place, but again, these are funded from the underlying funds and make up a fraction of the total AUM. Yes, losses can occur, but these deals are not exactly \"collecting pennies in front of a steamroller\". </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2) SAAS Exposure</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, that is not all there is to the OWL news. The SAAS (software as a stop-loss, or something like that) exposure has gotten the attention of the market as well. We discussed this more in depth with the members of our service, and we won't go into all the points here. But suffice to say, we believe the odds of Claude doing a massive software displacement line up with what everyone believed about Upstart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPST\" title=\"Upstart Holdings, Inc.\">UPST</a>)'s \"AI\" and displacement of Fair Isaac Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FICO\" title=\"Fair Isaac Corporation\">FICO</a>) and their scores in 2021. From the peak of that insanity, here are the returns for both. </p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_997c79b956a00b2a987971f5a5761939.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_997c79b956a00b2a987971f5a5761939.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_997c79b956a00b2a987971f5a5761939.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_997c79b956a00b2a987971f5a5761939.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3) Redemption Halt</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yes OWL did stop redemptions <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553774-blue-owl-halts-redemptions-at-private-credit-fund-targeted-for-retail-investors\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553774-blue-owl-halts-redemptions-at-private-credit-fund-targeted-for-retail-investors\" target=\"_blank\">on one of its funds. </a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While that may sound terrifying, not every asset has the liquidity of the US Treasury market. If you had a fund, which invested in Class A apartment buildings and you had to liquidate them, there is almost no way you could do that overnight without losing a lot of spread. Private credit is a far more complicated investment and anyone buying this debt of any single investment would have to do a lot of due diligence. It isn't really designed to be sold as needed for redemptions. Stopping the liquidation process is actually the best move and prevents unnecessary losses. If investors wanted the liquidity of public markets, well, they should have stayed in public markets. We think order will be restored down the line and let's keep in mind that even this fund makes up less than 1% of OWL's AUM.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Verdict</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yes, things might go bad for private credit at some point. If that is the argument and people want to stay away, that's ok. We think private credit is well-priced and designed for good returns. It is certainly beautifully priced relative to the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>). So we think this is a good time to invest a measured amount here. We did initiate OWL covered calls the other day and they have fairly attractive returns for a flattish price. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/47392447-17716019756624203.png?io=w640\" alt=\"-\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"1124\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/47392447-17716019756624203.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/47392447-17716019756624203.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/47392447-17716019756624203.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/20/47392447-17716019756624203.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's App</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also pointed out to our subscribers that the solid debt of OWL was trading at a near 7% yield to maturity.

At 1.3X, it has reached the highest level in a decade. Much of this is from offshore rig upgrades and reactivations, but also from newer product offerings like their Managed Pressure Drilling—MPD, Perforating, and Mineral Riser. The company is optimistic they have turned a corner, particularly as regards international and offshore-related projects. While we agree that the offshore industry is on an upswing, it should also be noted there are capacity limits to this increase on the deepwater side. We have what we have in floating inventory, and no one is building new units. So it's ok to be optimistic-I am—but let's keep our feet on the ground. This is not 2005. There is no oil boom coming.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OIS has three primary operating segments: Offshore Manufactured Products, Completion and Production Services, and Downhole Technologies.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719386394095056_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"OIS market offerings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"362\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719386394095056_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719386394095056_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719386394095056_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719386394095056_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">OIS market offerings <span>(OIS)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cindy Taylor, CEO, commented about the upgrade cycle now underway-</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We're beginning to see those white spaces, gaps be filled in. And so rig equipment will tend to lead the recovery, and that can be riser systems, MPD systems for us, the things that we offer as well as kind of the upgrade and service cycle around that equipment, but it all feeds deepwater infrastructure, which, again, that's kind of a bread and butter for us that plays into our more proprietary products.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Catalyst for Oil States</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Have you ever tried to use a long pole-something 12-15' long—to wash off a spot on the eaves of your house?

Once you've overcome mechanical flexing, submarine currents, and the occasional shark (<em>as you see below from a job I worked for BP in the GoM.

That's curious about what you're doing, and you have it in a stabbing position-verified by your robotic camera flyby controlled by a tether from the rig's deck.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719479657586558_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"shark swimming 3,400' BMSL\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"479\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719479657586558_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719479657586558_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719479657586558_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719479657586558_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">shark swimming 3,400' BMSL <span>(Author's files)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">You want it to snap in cleanly and make the connection. Making a long story short, it doesn't always happen, and non-productive time-NPT results. Oil companies hate this and will reward companies that enable smooth operations with contracts. That appears to be the case with the OIS Flexjoint connector. The Flexjoint enables the riser to withstand currents and maintain its connection to the subsea BOP by flexing with the force. (You do not want to imagine the misery that follows an unplanned disconnect-it's bad, really bad.) Having this leading position in Flexjoint connectors is a distinct advantage for OIS.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719456108050854_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"OIS leading market positions\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"354\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719456108050854_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719456108050854_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719456108050854_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-17719456108050854_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">OIS leading market positions <span>(OIS)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Managed Pressure Drilling-MPD is an interesting growth area for OIS. The segment is well covered by legacy multi-service OFS companies-Big Red. Big Blue. Big Aqua and others. They don't give a lot of information about it in the filing but commented favorably on the early results in the conference call.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OIS also has offerings in perforating that appear to be gaining success-in a fairly crowded marketplace. Here again the big colors hold the biggest chunks of this business. The company cited international opportunities as driving their optimism in this area.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In summary, OIS is a legacy supplier to the offshore industry with an excellent reputation in their core offerings. When companies like Transocean (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RIG\" title=\"Transocean Ltd.\">RIG</a>) talk about upgrade and reactivation capex, they very often are talking about money that will end up on OIS' income statement. From my experience, I can tell that when a client trusts your core offerings, it makes it much easier to get field trials for new technology.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">OIS Q4 Earning Call</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OIS reported revenues of $178 million, up 8% sequentially from the third quarter. Profitability also improved with adjusted EBITDA of $23 million, representing a 9% sequential increase. Non-cash impairments on long-lived assets led to a loss of $117 mm. This was related to valuation declared on the 2018 acquisition in their Downhole Technology segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OIS generated 63% greater positive cash flow of $50 mm for the quarter than previously and 129% greater $105 mm for the year. Free cash of $94 mm was reported, a 92% rise YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Their largest segment, Offshore Manufactured Products generated revenues of $123 million and EBITDA of $25 mm at a 20% margin. Backlog for this segment was reported at $435 mm. Completion Products turned in $23 mm in revenues and $7 mm in EBITDA with an operating margin of 32%. Restructuring charges of $5 mm were noted for the segment. Downhole Technologies reported revenues of $32 mm with EBITDA of $1.3 mm-impacted by segment impairments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OIS has a new 4-year cash flow-based credit agreement, which provides for borrowings of up to $75 million. This is under a revolving credit facility that replaced their asset-based lending credit agreement. OIS has $53 million of convertible senior notes outstanding at December 31. The plan is to use U.S. cash on hand and tap their new revolver to retire these notes prior to their maturity on April 1, 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At YE 2025, OIS had $15 mm in cash on hand, had retired $71 mm in senior notes during the year, and repurchased $17 mm in stock during 2025.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Guidance for 2026</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">OIS expects 2026 full-year revenues to range between $680 million and $700 million, up about 5% YoY. Full-year EBITDA should range between $90 million and $95 million, nearly double 2025. Q-1 should see revenues in a range of $150 million to $155 million and EBITDA of $18 million to $19 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong cash flows from operations are expected for the year. With a range of $60 million to $65 million, down from 2025 due to expected working capital builds. Investments in CapEx of $20 million to $25 million are planned for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872971-oil-states-international-inc-ois-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872971-oil-states-international-inc-ois-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">Company filings</a></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The offshore comeback has been a bit of a 'fits and starts' operation over the past couple of years. Signs are that it is accelerating all around, but further delays could impact OIS revenues and cash flows. The parabolic move higher over the past few days is concerning, as it's related more to implied tariff relief than an improvement in core business fundamentals. We haven't had the last word on tariffs yet, so there may be other shoes to drop.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Your takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think a lot of near-term growth is priced into OIS at current levels. As shown below, the company is trading far in excess of its peer group's EV/EBITDA on a TTM basis. On an NTM basis, they are more reasonable at 7.77X if they hit their revenue and EBITDA targets of $700 mm and $95 mm respectively, so let's use those numbers to estimate a closer valuation for the shares. OIS has essentially no LT debt, so with 58 mm shares outstanding and $95 mm in EBITDA 7.77X, you get a share price of $12.72.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-1771965983260553_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Offshore equipment cohort\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"254\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-1771965983260553_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-1771965983260553_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-1771965983260553_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/726292-1771965983260553_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Offshore equipment cohort <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If I were long, I would sell at current levels to protect the substantial gains made over a very short period of time. Accordingly, I rate OIS a sell at current levels, in spite of their excellent prospects in the year to come. If they revert to their January 2026 levels of $7-8.00 per share, I would look hard at taking a position for measured growth that will surely come if the offshore renaissance becomes a reality.</p>",

But now there is an <a href=\"https://crescentenergyco.com/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Crescent-Energy-Q4-2025-Earnings-Release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">obvious attempt to also gain royalty interest</a>s at a good price. Diversification into these two<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> areas can help with company performance during cyclical downturns. Creating a separate royalty company as others have done can also help to finance transactions. It is yet another interest in production profits that can aid a lower breakeven. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the meantime, the dominate upstream interests in the Eagle Ford and the Permian should provide above average profitability for a management that generally builds and sells companies. There are alot improvements to be made (as well be discussed in this article) that benefit royalties as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a management that pays a lot of attention to the cash flow statement. Not only should cash flow grow, but cash flow per share should grow as well. This company made 3 significant acquisitions in fiscal year 2025. That type of activity is going to make it very hard for investors to see the progress made for the properties already owned. It also makes the quarterly report next to useless.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, as the company grows larger, the acquisitions will become less significant (as a percentage of the company). What should happen over time is that operational improvements will dominate. This is a company that will very likely be concentrating on cash flow and free cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Professionals that build companies know that cash generation is the key to getting a good price when the right time comes to sell the company. Right now, this company is clearly in buying mode. That should tell investors, that the industry overall is likely cheap (and out of favor). When management like this one decides to sell the company, that will be the time for most of us to consider cutting back our presence investing in oil and gas to wait for the next favorable time to get in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last Article</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last article noted that the company closed the acquisition of Vital Energy. The current announcement notes that Vital Energy was only part of the company for a few days of the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But that means that because of this rather significant acquisition, the company is going to be showing considerable production growth in the present fiscal year (2026).</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720768478465462_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cresent Energy Permian Strategy Summary\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"496\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720768478465462_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720768478465462_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720768478465462_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720768478465462_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cresent Energy Permian Strategy Summary <span>(Crescent Energy Fourth Quarter 2025, Corporate Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://crescentenergyco.com/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Crescent-Energy-Q4-2025-Earnings-Investor-Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Now that the company</a> has acquired the assets, there is an update to the potential synergy savings. Fortunately, it is on the upward revisions side. More importantly, the rig activity has been sharply reduced.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As has been mentioned in many articles here, KKR is the manager of this company. Free cash flow is a very big deal to KKR. As the company gets larger and the financial statements are not clouded with lots of one-time items, this emphasis on free cash flow (growth) is likely to present itself first.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720771359191256_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Crescent Energy Permian Synergy Details Summarized\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"463\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720771359191256_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720771359191256_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720771359191256_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720771359191256_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Crescent Energy Permian Synergy Details Summarized <span>(Crescent Energy Fourth Quarter 2025, Corporate Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Vital Energy acquisition was by far the largest acquisition of the fiscal year. At issue here is things like stock dilution (and debt) come first with the benefits likely showing in fiscal year 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is showing investors where those benefits will come from. But this acquisition also provides the company with an entry into a second very low-cost basin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, as part of a larger company, \"in-housing\" some of the operations that were contracted out is a very big deal. Vital Energy had begun some of the operational improvements noted above before the acquisition. But it had not owned much of the Permian properties itself for all that long.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a much larger company (post combination) Crescent Energy is able to probably get better prices for the production than Vital could.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, both companies had to live with existing production costs to some extent because the previous operators were likely high cost. Those high costs can be dealt with to some extent. But largely, that older production simply declines in significance as production declines. It will be replaced by lower cost production. But in terms of operating costs declining, that is a weighted average process that will take some time for the new lower well costs to gain significance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Eagle Ford</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Eagle Ford assets have largely been a part of the company for a year. There was a large Eagle Ford acquisition of less than $1 billion that closed at the beginning of fiscal year 2025. That was really the only addition to these assets of a significant size.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720777754129007_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Crescent Energy Summary Of Eagle Ford Business\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"494\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720777754129007_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720777754129007_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720777754129007_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-17720777754129007_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Crescent Energy Summary Of Eagle Ford Business <span>(Crescent Energy Fourth Quarter 2025, Corporate Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is the place where the savings will become apparent first because these assets are the oldest assets (for the most part) in the portfolio. This is also where most of the company production is presently. Future acquisitions could change that now that the company has a presence in the Permian.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Probably the biggest surprise is the natural gas position that is so close to export capability and may also be sold in the future to data centers as well. This was an upside that many of us did not see on the horizon at the time this company began operations. Now it is a big deal.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Debt</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This company has received one debt rating upgrade since it went public. There is a goal here to get to investment grade.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-1772078089649364_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Crescent Energy Debt Summary\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-1772078089649364_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-1772078089649364_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-1772078089649364_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1102834-1772078089649364_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Crescent Energy Debt Summary <span>(Crescent Energy Fourth Quarter 2025, Corporate Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As noted above, things are going to definitely improve because of that goal of an investment grade rating. If the improvements shown before (and probably a few more I did not show) actually materially improve things, then that will change the debt rating fraction numerator.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This company is also faster than most to sell noncore acreage to raise cash. Probably one of the best debt managers in the business is KKR. This is what is going to make the cash flow statement the most important statement in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Crescent Energy did post a loss for the quarter as there was an impairment charge combined with a lot of transaction costs that were a part of the Vital Energy acquisition closing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What as more important is that cash flow grew significantly for the fiscal year while the debt ratio stayed within range for the company to still go for an investment grade debt rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As long as this company is making acquisitions, that likely means that acquisition prices are attractive (and the industry remains relatively out of favor).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That makes this idea a long-term idea with the idea that the company will be built during times of attractive acquisition prices. It will be sold when prices are cyclically strong. But that means investors need to wait patiently for the time when selling prices are attractive enough to sell the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a strong buy idea in that rarely do investors get the chance to invest alongside KKR and John Goff. That does mean success is guaranteed. But it does put the odds in favor of the investment idea succeeding. This part has not changed since the company went public.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would probably hang on to this idea until the company gets sold.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even with investors like KKR and John Goff, an investment idea can fail to work out for any number of reasons. However, there is a safety factor here in that the debt ratio is within a reasonable range. Companies with relatively low debt rarely get into serious trouble. There is every chance here that with the project improvements to acquired properties, that debt ratio will decline even if no money was used to repay debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Any acquisition can fail to meet expectations. On the other side of that both John Goff and KKR have made many acquisitions (to have a whole lot of experience making acquisitions).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">KKR is used to building and selling companies. That lowers the risk of fast growth. Fast growth has the risk of losing quality control and cost overruns. So, the experience is needed to minimize some potentially serious issues.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is extremely difficult to tell much of anything from the financial statements when a company is constantly making acquisitions. But that makes the investor evaluation of management very important to the success of the investment. At this point we are very much dependent upon management representations to tell the progress made. Debt ratings help as well.</p>",
