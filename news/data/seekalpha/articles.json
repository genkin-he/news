Out of the $1.6B in total backlog, Electric Utility and Commercial &amp; Other Industrial contributed over half at a combined $824M as order activity accelerated in their data center end market, with larger project sizes and the company winning its first $75M (megaproject) deal in the end market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With management optimistic on the FY26 outlook of its end markets, analysts have revised their<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/POWL/earnings/revisions\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/POWL/earnings/revisions\" target=\"_blank\"> forward growth projections</a> that point to the company accelerating both its revenue and earnings until FY28. Meanwhile, the forward P/E ratio has also expanded over 73% since the time of my last writing, reflecting growing investor optimism in the company’s growth prospects.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the successful execution of its backlog is key, along with monitoring for potential order cancellation, I am bullish on the long-term prospects of the company as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having said that, I believe that the price action is extended at the moment and will therefore wait for a better entry point, closer to the 10Wk level at $460 per share that would expand the size of my upside potential towards my price target of $585 per share.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strength in Electric Utility and Oil &amp; Gas segments boosts revenue by 4% <span id=\"jS$303\" class=\"j3\">YoY</span> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Powell Industries reported their Q1 FY26 earnings at the start of February, where the company grew its revenues and earnings per share by 4% and 18.8%, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the revenue front, Powell generated $251.2M in total revenue, with strength in its Electric Utility and Oil &amp; Gas markets that contribute 35% and 2%, respectively, contributing over 66.5% of Total Revenue. Note that Oil &amp; Gas continues to be the largest revenue segment of Powell Industries; however, the contribution from Electric Utility has expanded over 630 basis points on a year-over-year basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, their Commercial &amp; other industrial and Petrochemical segments saw a year-over-year decline in revenues of 8.2% and 31.3%, respectively, which probably explains why the company missed their revenue estimates for the quarter by a little over 2%.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54857510-17721951610448954_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"853\" data-height=\"632\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54857510-17721951610448954_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q1 FY26 Earnings Slides: Revenue Mix by sector over the years\" width=\"640\" height=\"474\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"474\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54857510-17721951610448954_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54857510-17721951610448954_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54857510-17721951610448954_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54857510-17721951610448954_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Q1 FY26 Earnings Slides: Revenue Mix by sector over the years</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to profitability, gross margins expanded on a year-over-year basis by 370 basis points to 28.4%, which management attributed to favorable volume leverage, strong project execution, and a stable pricing environment, while earnings per share beat estimates as well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Record-Breaking New Orders &amp; Backlog Growth Drive Optimism</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason, however, the stock surged after earnings is tied to its New Orders and Backlog growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let me further elaborate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the quarter, Powell’s New Orders grew 63% YoY to $439M, which was their highest quarterly total in over two years, with widespread activity across oil and gas, data centers, and the electric utilities markets. This is compared to just 1% growth in New Orders to $271M in Q4 FY25.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As management discussed on the<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865966-powell-industries-inc-powl-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4865966-powell-industries-inc-powl-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\"> earnings call</a>, New Orders from their Commercial &amp; Other Industrial market accelerated, accounting for almost 50% of their total awards during the quarter as the average project size is growing substantially along with the company’s first megaproject order of approximately $75M in the data center end market. Particularly, when it comes to their Data Center end market within the Commercial &amp; Other Industrial business segment, new orders exceeded $100M, accounting for over 22% of Total New Orders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is also reflected in their backlog, which grew 16% YoY to $1.6B, out of which 60% or so is expected to convert into revenue over the next 12 months. This is compared to just a 3% YoY increase in backlog to $1.4B in Q4 FY25.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see in the image below, Powell’s backlog growth has been driven by Electric Utility and Commercial &amp; Other Industrial markets, now accounting for 30% and 22%, respectively, or over half of total backlog at $824M for the first time ever. Note that out of the 22% backlog contribution from Commercial &amp; Other Industrial market segment, data centers account for roughly 15% of the backlog, both of which are record levels for Powell Industries.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54857510-17721952205417225_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"843\" data-height=\"637\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54857510-17721952205417225_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q1 FY26 Earnings Slides: Backlog Diversification across business segments\" width=\"640\" height=\"484\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"484\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54857510-17721952205417225_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54857510-17721952205417225_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54857510-17721952205417225_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54857510-17721952205417225_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Q1 FY26 Earnings Slides: Backlog Diversification across business segments</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This fits into management’s optimism on Powell’s position as a diversified manufacturer of electrical distribution products and systems amid a secular and durable growth trend that involves “a growing and broad investment in power generation and grid modernization to support data center and AI capacity growth, domestic manufacturing, electrification, and the export of energy resources like LNG.”</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Forward growth Estimates Revised Higher; Price Multiples Expand Faster</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The sudden surge in New Orders and Backlog quickly got translated into analysts revising their forward growth projections higher for revenue and earnings. To further support the upward revisions was the positive management commentary during the earnings call, where they were optimistic on the outlook for all their major end markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Starting with their largest Oil &amp; Gas market, management discussed that the fundamentals for the US natural gas market continue to support their investments in LNG as project activity remains robust. When it comes to their Electric Utility market, management pointed to the growing wave of investment in electrical infrastructure, which positions Powell Industries to capture another year of strong activity in the segment. What was also encouraging was the acceleration of order activity in the data center end market, which gives Powell Industries’ management the confidence to further grow their presence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the moment, analysts are projecting Powell Industries to grow their revenues by 7.78% YoY in FY26, followed by acceleration in revenue growth rate every single year until FY28 to $1.51B, indicating the structural and durable nature of the demand in their end markets that is not expected to fade anytime soon. As you can also see, the magnitude of upward revision to FY27 and FY28 revenue expectations is much higher compared to that of FY26.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54857510-17721952946221678_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1541\" data-height=\"743\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54857510-17721952946221678_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA: Forward revenue growth estimates by consensus\" width=\"640\" height=\"309\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"309\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54857510-17721952946221678_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54857510-17721952946221678_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54857510-17721952946221678_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/54857510-17721952946221678_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA: Forward revenue growth estimates by consensus</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is similar to the forward earnings growth rate projections, which have been significantly raised for FY26 and beyond.

Note that the PE ratio has expanded over 73% since the time of my previous writing, when the stock was trading at a non-GAAP PE ratio of 19. During the same period of time, the forward earnings per share for FY26 have been revised higher by over 7%. In other words, most of the gain in the stock price during this period of time has been primarily driven by multiple expansion, driven by renewed investor optimism on the company’s forward growth prospects after the 63% YoY surge in New Orders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another way to look at it is that even though Powell’s forward PE ratio based on FY26 earnings per share projection has risen considerably higher, it compresses down to 25.5 when taking FY28 earnings per share into account. This is just 16% higher than the sector median at 21.52, which is reasonable, in my opinion, for a company that is projected to see both a revenue and earnings per share acceleration into FY28.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, if we take the S&amp;P 500 as a proxy, where its 10-year<a href=\"https://advantage.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_070325.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://advantage.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_070325.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"> average</a> PE ratio stands at 18.8, for companies growing their earnings on average by 9% annually, I believe Powell Industries deserves to trade at 1.4x given that its earnings are projected to grow at roughly 13% over the next three years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This will translate to a PE ratio of 27, or a price target of $583 per share, that represents an upside of 6% from current levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Can these estimates be revised higher upon further New Order strength ahead? Absolutely.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But what about the risk of order cancellations or capacity not being able to meet the backlog?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is what we will discuss next.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks &amp; Conclusions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the earnings call, management discussed that they are taking measures to expand productive capacity to ensure the execution and delivery of their project backlog, which include “adding additional leased facilities to support the expansion of production lines, increased inventory needs, and broader collaboration with their supply base to ramp supply and improve cycle times as well as rebalancing and reallocating the manufacture of select products across our facilities in North America.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the expansion of their Jacintoport facility is on track to be completed by H2 FY26, which will serve all of their end markets, particularly their Oil &amp; Gas customers, where they anticipate large-scale LNG project development work to come over the next 3-5 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When asked about how the management is thinking about ramping up capex in the coming years, the management briefly discussed that they are evaluating a potential $100M investment in a new facility to support multiyear growth. Note that the company has a $500M cash balance, which is more than sufficient to fund higher capex investments so that the company can continue to expand their capacity to fulfill both their current backlog and position to capture forward demand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aside from ensuring that Powell has the necessary capacity to fulfill the execution of their current backlog, there is also the possibility of potential order cancellation, as management pointed out is \"a future concern that’s on their radar\" and can add significant volatility to forward growth projections.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the meantime, I also view that the stock price is currently extended after the 72% YTD rally, with its weekly RSI at close to 75.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, while I am bullish on the company’s long-term prospects, I will not be chasing the rally.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Instead, I will wait for some more consolidation in the stock price. Ideally, I would like for the stock to correct to its 10Wk at roughly $460 per share, which would represent a downside risk of close to 15% from current levels. At that point, I may consider initiating a position, as the size of my potential upside would have expanded from 6% at current levels to over 20%, making the risk-reward more attractive.</p>",

DYT then determines the likelihood of price and yield returning to previous levels based on company strength, resources, and the state of their industry.This determination is made by examining business metrics like:</span></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>S&amp;P quality</li> <li>Dividend growth rate</li> <li>Price/earnings ratio</li> <li>Payout ratio</li> <li>Return on invested capital</li> <li>Free cash flow</li> <li>Free cash flow yield</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the assessment is correct, the company recovers, and the yield returns to its mean, the investors benefit from both a resurgent share price and the higher yields during the recovery period. DYT concentrates on large companies with a proven business model. It is a long term strategy, with a timeline of years (4-5 years is a common time frame). The returns, however are large enough to be worth the wait.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Anyone interested in going further into DYT can look at the <a href=\"https://www.iqtrends.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Investment Quality Trends</a> site, the <a href=\"https://simplysafedividends.com/world-of-dividends/posts/1104-dividend-yield-theory-explained\" rel=\"nofollow\">World of Dividends </a>blog, or my earlier reports on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4795540-dividend-yield-theory-says-hershey-a-buy\">Hershey</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSY\" title=\"The Hershey Company\">HSY</a>) and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4798671-dividend-yield-theory-says-merck-is-a-buy\">Merck</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRK\" title=\"Merck &amp; Co., Inc.\">MRK</a>), and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872261-factset-research-systems-value-over-the-ai-horizon\">FactSet Data Systems</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FDS\" title=\"FactSet Research Systems Inc.\">FDS</a>).</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Brown-Forman Corporation</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Brown-Forman Corporation (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BF.B\" title=\"Brown-Forman Corporation\">BF.B</a></span>) is one of the largest spirits companies in the world. It has $4 billion in annual revenue, operates globally and has some of the most recognized products in the industry, including Jack Daniels, Old Forester, Woodford, Diplomatico, Suntory, and Chambord. It was founded in 1870 and has increased its dividend for 42 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company doesn't meet some traditional Dividend Yield Theory metrics, but is close enough overall to merit consideration:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p>Metric</p></td> <td><p>DYT Target</p></td> <td><p>BF</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>S&amp;P Quality</p></td> <td><p>A-</p></td> <td><p>B+</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>10 yr.

For two decades, from 2000 through 2020, long term investors were every pleased as the stock went on a steady climb from about $6 to $80 per share. Since then, however, it has just as steadily fallen as low as $26, for a decline of 67%. Is this a buying opportunity, or is the company in trouble from which there is no return? Brown-Forman is facing significant challenges that they have not encountered before. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4456065-brown-forman-weight-loss-drugs-cannabis-gen-z-demand\">CEO Lawson Whiting acknowledged the threats</a> from GLP-1 drugs, cannabis, and Gen-Z’s comparatively lower alcohol consumption, and US alcohol is a fat target in the tariff wars. When we look at the key DYT statistic, historical yield, it’s necessary to go back decades to determine a range. The yield was persistently low while the share price had its lengthy rise, even as the dividend grew 50% over the period. Only when we look 2 years does a range become clear (the 2007 spike comes from a $1.65/share special dividend).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using this timeline, we can proceed with a Dividend Yield Theory analysis. Excluding the 2007 special dividend, the yield range is from 0.90% to 3.55% with a mean of about 1.8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_0b427e2a31a767e88e78eb89c623dffa.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Brown-Forman price and yield\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"439\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_0b427e2a31a767e88e78eb89c623dffa.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_0b427e2a31a767e88e78eb89c623dffa.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_0b427e2a31a767e88e78eb89c623dffa.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Brown-Forman price and yield <span>(YCharts)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We then look at the impact on share prices if the yield returns to its average:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Current dividend: $0.92.</li> <li>Current share price: $30.</li> <li>Current yield: 3.14%.</li> <li>Mean yield: 1.8%.</li> <li>Current yield: 74.4% above mean yield.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To return to the mean yield, the share price must increase 74.4%. 74.4% of the current $30 price is a gain of $22.33 and a final price of $52.33/share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividends paid while the price recovery is in process are added to the gain.

The annual financials in that time haven’t been great but in no way offer a justification for it:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td></td> <td><p>Apr 2022</p></td> <td><p>Apr 2023</p></td> <td><p>Apr 2024</p></td> <td><p>Apr 2025</p></td> <td><p>TTM</p></td> <td><p>2022-2025 change</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Revenue ($million)</p></td> <td><p>3933</p></td> <td><p>4228</p></td> <td><p>4178</p></td> <td><p>3975</p></td> <td><p>3889</p></td> <td><p>-1%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Operating inc.

Is the current price of $30 and PE ratio of 18 has it returned to a reasonable level or has it been driven unreasonably below that? The answer to this question determines whether BH.B is a good investment.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current environment</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The outlook for Brown-Forman is being determined by three main factors:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Tariffs</p></li> <li><p>International sales environment</p></li> <li><p>Domestic sales environment</p></li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Tariffs</span></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Whiskey tariffs have long been a way for other countries to flex their trade muscles against the US. There was a 25% tariff from 2018-2022, a 50% tariff threatened last year, and currently a 15% tariff in the EU and other countries. <a href=\"https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2025/07/28/us-eu-tariffs-deal-for-champagne-whiskey-wine-and-alcohol/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The 2018 tariffs caused a 25% drop in international sales</a> and estimates are for -15% under current tariffs. This is meaningful, since foreign sales account for 55% of revenue. The popularity of tariffs as a trade weapon also creates ongoing uncertainty, which always reduces investor enthusiasm.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">International sales environment</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although sales typically rebound when tariffs are removed, the current situation is not typical. In addition to an unexpected and harsh general tariff regime, the Trump administration’s foreign policy has caused ill will in many of our trading partners. So, for example, Canada has a 25% tariff on US alcohol, but sales there have plummeted 60%, far more than an expectation from tariffs alone. Some provinces have stopped selling US alcohol entirely. Much of the motivation for buying alcohol comes from a brand’s cachet, which in the case of American whiskey is very strong. When this is severely damaged, as it is now, it can take a long time to be repaired.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The strength of the dollar also has an effect on international results. The dollar has declined about 10% over the past year, which hurts the top and bottom lines when foreign sales are converted to USD.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Domestic sales environment</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While foreign sales have held their own over several years, domestic sales have declined. The following data is for 6 month periods, which is the latest available.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td></td> <td><p>Oct 2022</p></td> <td><p>Oct 2023</p></td> <td><p>Oct 2024</p></td> <td><p>Oct 2025</p></td> <td><p>Change 22-25</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Domestic ($million)</p></td> <td><p>1016</p></td> <td><p>973</p></td> <td><p>908</p></td> <td><p>830</p></td> <td><p>-18.3%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>International ($million)</p></td> <td><p>966</p></td> <td><p>1052</p></td> <td><p>996</p></td> <td><p>1016</p></td> <td><p>+5.1%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are two main trends in this decline: 1) changing drinking behavior, and 2) cannabis consumption.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><strong>Americans are drinking less.</strong></span> According to <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1582/Alcohol-Drinking.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gallup</a> (and others), the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol was stable for most of this century, but has markedly declined from 67% in 2022 to 54% in 2025. The <a href=\"https://news.northeastern.edu/2025/08/18/why-people-are-drinking-less-alcohol/\" rel=\"nofollow\">change has been attributed to</a> health awareness, changing social norms, and the impact of the pandemic. This is even more marked for young adults, like Generation Z, who seem to have<a href=\"https://www.askattest.com/blog/research/gen-z-alcohol-trends\" rel=\"nofollow\"> a different relationship</a> with alcohol than their elders. Adding to this are the new generation of weight-loss drugs, which have been shown to reduce the desire for alcohol. <a href=\"https://time.com/7203140/gen-z-drinking-less-alcohol/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> These trends appear to be a major cultural shift. They</a> have already had an impact on Brown-Forman and its peers, and are <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dougmelville/2026/01/02/is-the-world-going-sober-830-million-wiped-of-liquor-stocks-as-jim-beam-halts-output/\" rel=\"noopener\">observed outside the US as well</a>. If they prove durable the impact will be long term. Adding to this is the new generation of weight-loss drugs, which have been shown to reduce the desire for alcohol. With <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/news/press/2025/08/nearly-12-percent-of-americans-have-used-glp-1-weight.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">nearly 12 percent of Americans having used GLP-1 drugs</a> for weight loss so far, this exacerbates the lower consumption trend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span><strong>Cannabis has emerged</strong> as a big competitor to alcohol in recent years:</span> <a href=\"https://www.cannabissciencetech.com/view/2025-state-of-the-cannabis-industry-sales-trends-and-forecasts\" rel=\"nofollow\">Domestic cannabis sales</a> reached $23.9 billion in 2025, and it is legal in 40 states. For many people cannabis has replaced alcohol, whether it be for sleep, social reasons, or just intoxication. When a person consumes cannabis, they aren’t drinking. The massive hole this creates in the alcohol market is only going to get bigger as the US cannabis market continues to grow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Every company faces challenges, and their long term success depends on meeting those challenges successfully. Unfortunately, there’s little in Brown-Forman’s recent history to suggest they will do this. Revenues and earnings have been dropping, and the company expects another single digit decline this year. Acquisition of other brands is a tried and true strategy in the industry, but Brown-Forman’s acquisitions results have been mixed at best. New products like <a href=\"https://www.foodrepublic.com/1939389/jack-daniels-blackberry-whiskey-review/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blackberry Jack</a> have not been enough to move the needle. The path to future growth is very unclear. Instead, they have been retrenching, <a href=\"https://www.brown-forman.com/article/brown-forman-announces-series-strategic-initiatives-growth-company-restructure-globally\" rel=\"nofollow\">closing their barrel-making facility</a> and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4534736-jim-beam-to-idle-kentucky-distillery-as-bourbon-demand-slows\">idling a distillery</a>.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Brown-Forman Summary and Investing Recommendation</h3> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recommendation: HOLD. According to Dividend Yield Theory, Brown-Forman has a potential total return of 86.7% over the next four or five years. DYT usually highlights companies with problems, and it takes courage and a solid bull case to commit money to them. However, the obstacles facing BF, led by a customer base that is drinking less, cast doubt about a successful turnaround in growth or a return to previous highs. The challenges are long term and substantial, and management does not seem to have a convincing long term strategy to address them. It's appropriate to keep currently owned shares, because there is a profitable level of base business that could improve if trends change, and the company is shareholder-friendly in terms of share buybacks and dividend increases. However, the path to a return to historical levels of business and stock prices is not clear, and there are companies with more potential elsewhere.</p>",

Since then, ROST<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> stock has risen about 18%. TJX Companies (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TJX\" title=\"The TJX Companies, Inc.\">TJX</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) has followed more or less the same path.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And the TJX model is also compelling to me, basically as the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557192-tjx-outlines-4-percent-5-percent-sales-growth-and-146-new-stores-for-2027-amid-strong-q4\">CEO said</a>: the company can prove that in-store shopping is still very solid. And even though Q4 earnings prove this well, I am still very cautious about the margin of safety issue. The current premium on TJX is as if it were a company that you would have to really want to have in your portfolio to accept paying that price, and for me, that is not the case. That is why I am going with a hold rating for TJX stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 Earnings: TJX Showed Resilience</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The CEO described the quarter as “excellent,” but I only agree in part. It was indeed a very solid Q4, and I liked the comp sales of ~5%, but on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874698-the-tjx-companies-inc-tjx-q4-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a>, that number was described as “very strong.” I don't know if it's that strong; to me, it's more like okay, very solid. But in any case, considering that the landscape is not the best, it is indeed a positive performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, it seems to me to be an endorsement that this treasure hunt experience is as resilient as we imagined and as history would suggest. Especially since TJX's 10-year CAGR for revenue is almost 7%, the same for EBIT and EBITDA, which grew by an average of 6.9% per year. And that, with a few buybacks and better net income, caused EPS to compound in double digits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But back to the quarter, the comparable sales mix was also quite interesting in my view. In Q4 last year, Marmaxx's performance was slightly worse, and TJX Canada and TJX International drove performance up. Now, we saw the same number for comp sales (~5%), but with slightly stronger performance from Marmaxx and HomeGoods in the U.S.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/57960026-17721387848451016_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1162\" data-height=\"396\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/57960026-17721387848451016_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TJX - Comp sales\" width=\"640\" height=\"218\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/57960026-17721387848451016_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/57960026-17721387848451016_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/57960026-17721387848451016_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/57960026-17721387848451016_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>TJX Earnings Release</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We are talking about comp sales, but as TJX continued to expand, net sales increased 9% YoY, and the pretax profit margin increased 1.9 pps, causing EPS to increase by more than 20%. It is really a very good performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another thing I liked to see was the mentions in the earnings call of TJX's initiatives. They mentioned that they are remodeling stores and new store prototypes, in addition to more aggressive marketing, all to maintain this high growth we are seeing. All of this makes it possible to be confident that TJX will continue to be a compounder in the coming years. The execution is very good, there are new initiatives to run, and the business model remains intact and minimally protected from the macroeconomic scenario and other passing trends such as fashion, which is difficult to predict.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TJX: Great Is Quite Different From Perfect</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't think Q4 earnings were bad, or that TJX's business model has deteriorated, far from it. But I think we should separate the great from the perfect. The prospects are good, but there are still risks and uncertainties. For example, all these initiatives that TJX is undertaking are really great, but they carry execution risk. If the marketing campaign is too aggressive and does not deliver the expected top-line results, it could put pressure on margins, just as new store prototypes may not be so well received by an already loyal customer base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason I am saying this is not because I want TJX to stop in time; I want them to carry out these initiatives. It is just to bring us back to reality. This is a retail company like any other; TJX has its moats and everything else, but it is not untouchable. Yes, macro sensitivity is much lower here, but the company can still suffer from crises and tariffs, for instance, as the company mentioned that it is “evaluating the potential impact of last Friday’s ruling on tariffs.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And that totally goes against the valuation. Here we are no longer talking about TJX stock being a bargain; we are talking about a quality company that trades at a quality premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the current fiscal year, we are talking about a P/E of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TJX/valuation/metrics\">30x</a>, the same as ROST. Considering the next fiscal year, the P/E goes to 27x, slightly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TJX/peers/comparison\">lower than ROST</a>, and as TJX is growing slightly more than Ross, this seems good. But looking at the multiples in isolation, I don't like it very much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">27x earnings means a potential earnings yield of ~3.5%, and for revenue and net income that should grow in the high single digits in the long term, it seems fair, reasonable but far from compelling.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Does a company that will compound EPS at 8% or 9% per year deserve to be traded at 27x earnings? In my opinion, maybe. If we are talking about a Costco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COST\" title=\"Costco Wholesale Corporation\">COST</a>), I think it is reasonable. If the uncertainties, risks, and competitive environment are greater, then I cannot be so optimistic, and I think that is the case with TJX.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is worse when compared to its own history. TJX's average forward P/E is 25x, and it is currently at the 27x-30x I mentioned (depending on which fiscal year you look at). It is a premium that in some multiples reaches 20% to 30% of TJX stock's own history.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/57960026-1772138784888764_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"943\" data-height=\"880\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/57960026-1772138784888764_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TJX Valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"597\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/57960026-1772138784888764_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/57960026-1772138784888764_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/57960026-1772138784888764_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/57960026-1772138784888764_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And if you think it is managing to grow, maybe it really deserves that premium. But personally, I prefer to buy when there is a discount, whether due to some temporary fear or just lower market sentiment towards the sector, perhaps when there is some kind of rotation again, making these quality names cheaper.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, if we look at the chart below, we can see that TJX has already (not long ago) traded at 20x earnings (and that's TTM, not forward), so I prefer to keep an eye on these moments, which, in my opinion, are bound to happen eventually.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_34aceca8dbed4923096c73d394c5e68d.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_34aceca8dbed4923096c73d394c5e68d.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_34aceca8dbed4923096c73d394c5e68d.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_34aceca8dbed4923096c73d394c5e68d.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe my hold rating here makes a lot of sense. On the one hand, it shows that I like the case, since TJX is a great company, cash cow, etc. But at the same time, it shows that at these prices, I'm not a buyer.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I also don't think that the valuation makes it a sell; there isn't such a bad negative asymmetry - it's close to fair. So I prefer to stay on the sidelines and wait. That's why I'm starting my TJX coverage with a hold rating.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NP\" title=\"Neptune Insurance Holdings Inc.\">NP</a></span>) is a newly listed insurance agent benefiting from multiple regulatory and market tailwinds pushing demand for flood insurance higher. Mortgage lenders are increasingly asking borrowers to insure<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> properties against flood, thus protecting the collateral against the mortgage. New regulations are increasing the appeal of private flood insurance versus the National Flood Insurance Program \"NFIP,\" the largest player on the market today. Finally, NP benefits from a first-mover advantage as the first large-scale insurance agent.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unique Market</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The flood insurance market is dominated by the Federal Government through NFIP, a program created in the late 1960s to fill a coverage gap against floods, a catastrophic event risk that is hard to insure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Neptune isn't an insurer, but it underwrites flood policies to private insurers who compete with NFIP. Thus, the program and its scope have an impact on NP. One can say that NFIP is a competitor to NP and its \"capacity providers\" — the name NP gives for its private insurance customers/partners who buy the insurance policies it underwrites.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't expect NFIP to end anytime soon. However, regulators recognize the <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/case-study/nfip-debt\" rel=\"nofollow\">financial burden</a> of the program on the federal budget. It has been living on congressional extensions for some time now, as opposed to a permanent budget.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regulatory Tailwinds</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NFIP has been offering subsidized flood insurance for decades. In 2021, regulators decided that it was time for NFIP to start charging market rates. The new premium prices won't rise overnight. The maximum amount an existing insurance policy will increase is <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance/risk-rating\" rel=\"nofollow\">capped at 18%</a> annually. Since the gap between what NFIP charges and the \"fair price\" is large, it will take multiple years at this rate for the premiums to reach this fair market level. As premiums start to increase, the appeal of NFIP insurance will start to diminish. This will help NP increase its market penetration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In 2023, the Government Accountability Office \"GAO\" conducted a <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-105977\" rel=\"nofollow\">study</a> that found that 66% of NFIP policies will have to increase to reach a fair market price that reflects the risk. 31% of total NFIP's policies would increase by more than 100% to match FEMA's risk 2.0 methodology. FEMA started Risk 2.0 in October 2021. That means that even if these policies increased by 18% annually, many are yet to reach the market price, i.e., 18% since October 2021 is 72% increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/830/827936.png\" alt=\"GAO\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GAO</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Impressive Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yesterday, NP uploaded its first <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/172055006\">10-K filing</a> to the SEC (annual report), showing impressive growth. In FY'25, revenue stood at $159.5 million, up 34% YoY. GAAP net income was up 8%; however, this figure was impacted by multiple one-time items tied to the IPO, such as the deal's professional expenses ($9 million) and an $11.1 million jump in SBC costs after NP's shares became public. Overall, adjusted net income stood at $56.9 million, up 37.6% YoY (<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2067129/000206712926000007/nyse-20251231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">p.71</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Adding to NP's moat is the quality of its earnings due to visibility. NP isn't an insurer. It underwrites the insurance policy and manages it on behalf of a capacity provider. It earns recurring revenue for both services on a continuous basis. As long as the policy is renewed, NP will continue earning fees as a % of the premium paid, while passing the reset to the capacity provider as compensation for taking the actual risk of the policy. In 2025, 67.9% of revenue came from renewed past policies. Overall, the company boasts a renewal rate of 86.1%, meaning that customers see value in the policies they were sold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on the loss ratio of NP's policies, it seems that it is delivering value for its capacity providers as well. The company's policies are less costly compared to NFIP's policies. This is demonstrated by the lower loss ratio during catastrophic events, as shown in the chart below. In 2025, NP ended the year with 40 capacity providers, up from 23 in the prior year. This demonstrates the value that the company brings to both buyers and sellers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2067129/000206712926000007/nyse-20251231_g7.jpg\" alt=\"22886\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>NP</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Wall Street consensus non-GAAP EPS for this year is $0.52. In 2025, diluted adjusted EPS stood at $0.41 (<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2067129/000206712926000007/nyse-20251231.htm#ifb6def25b58f447282d693e2d5f51a1a_106\" rel=\"nofollow\">p.71)</a>. Thus, this year's EPS forecast implies a deceleration of growth, down to 19.2% YoY, compared to 32.3% in 2025.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>FY'26e</td> <td>FY'25</td> <td>FY'24</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Adjusted EPS (diluted)</td> <td>$0.52</td> <td>$0.41</td> <td>$0.31</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Is this because of the law of large numbers? I believe yes. The average diluted shares outstanding as of December 2025 stood at 140,041,763. Using this figure as a proxy for FY'26 shares, and multiplying by the consensus $0.52/share FY'26e EPS results in a net income forecast of $72.8 million. In absolute terms, that's $15.9 million more than FY'25's adjusted income (which stood at $56.9 million). For perspective, the absolute growth in adjusted income between FY'25 and FY'24 was $15.5 million. These figures suggest that NP is growing at the same cadence, but the growth rate is different because of the law of large numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of valuation, a $0.52 EPS translates to a forward P/E of 41x. This isn't exactly cheap when compared to the financial sector. But at the same time, NP has certain characteristics that support a higher valuation, namely the flywheel effect of its Triton insurance writing software, which learns from each insurance policy it underwrites, collecting data to price policies more accurately.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the closest comparison to NP that I've recently covered is Accelerant Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARX\" title=\"Accelerant Holdings\">ARX</a>). Both run an AI-powered, data-centric, insurance General Managing Agent \"GMA\" services that funnel policies to \"Capacity Providers\" or \"Risk Capital Partners\" as Accelerant likes to call the insurance companies \"buying\" its policies. However, there is an important difference. Accelerant retains about 10% of the policies it underwrites. On the other hand, NP is a pure, capital-light, GMA service provider. Is this enough to explain the valuation difference between the two? Accelerant has a forward P/E ratio of 13x. That's a fraction of NP's valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NP's above-average valuation increases the bar it needs to hit to maintain its price levels. Growth seems already baked into the price, and execution needs to be near perfect. This bullish rating assumes investors have the capacity to withstand volatile trading and hold through the long term as NP delivers on growth and exceeds what's already baked in the price. The market is nascent, unlocked by FEMA's Risk 2.0 initiative, which is still unfolding. Intel Market Research estimates the value of the Flood Market at $13.2 billion in 2025. NFIP <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance#:~:text=Work%20With%20the%20NFIP,trillion%20in%20coverage%20against%20flood.\" rel=\"nofollow\">holds</a> 4.7 million insurance policies with <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R44593\" rel=\"nofollow\">$4.6 billion</a> in annual premiums. For perspective, NP holds 280,000 policies in force with an annual premium of $367 million (<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0002067129/000206712926000007/nyse-20251231.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">p.68</a>). This leaves NP with a lot of growth runway.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk to consider is the exposure to economic cycles. If, for any reason, the capacity providers decided not to take on flood policies, NP's business will suffer. Also, NP could face reputation damage if its capacity partners don't fulfill their coverage promises. Although NP doesn't provide coverage, it is the customer-facing agent.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think NP offers a unique growth opportunity in the Flood insurance market. Regulatory tailwinds support a buy thesis for long-term investors. NFIP, the largest flood insurance provider, isn't popular among politicians concerned about the government's debt and budget. NFIP isn't profitable, unlike other government-sponsored entities such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FNMA\" title=\"Federal National Mortgage Association\">FNMA</a>) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FMCC\" title=\"Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation\">FMCC</a>). I believe that the smaller NFIP gets, the happier many lawmakers will be.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, this brings us to a critical political concern. As of now, agents and insurance companies can refuse to underwrite a policy if it is risky. Thus, the possibility of cherry picking exists. It is possible that NP picks low-risk policies and sends the \"bad apples\" to NFIP. In the past, the federal government implemented laws that prevented this kind of behavior in certain insurance markets, particularly health insurance.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>In the most extreme case, the private market may “cherry-pick” (i.e., adversely select against the NFIP) the profitable, lower-risk NFIP policies that are “overpriced” either due to cross-subsidization or imprecise flood insurance rate structures, particularly when there is pricing inefficiency in favor of the customer. Congressional Research Service (<a href=\"https://www.rstreet.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/CRS-Private-Flood-Insurance-and-the-NFIP.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">p.15</a>).</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Affordable Care Act limited the ability of health insurance companies to <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/pre-existing-conditions\" rel=\"nofollow\">refuse</a> to write policies based on the health of the individual. This made it very hard to \"cherry-pick\" customers in large segments of the healthcare sector. One can imagine a similar policy being implemented in the Flood insurance market.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

This is at meaningful discount from peer &amp; the sector averages.</p> <p>The company generated roughly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HMY/profitability#:~:text=A%2B-,32.32%25,-5.58%25\">30% ROE</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> on opening equity on TTM basis. That is significantly higher as compared to average ROE for the company. At the same time, the company had also been able to achieve meaningful earnings improvement on this period. The market most probably is assuming this to be a peak cycle performance rather than a normalized earning power and ROE for the company. While, the market is not entirely incorrect in its assessment — the current performance for that matter is due to the significant appreciation in the yellow metal. However, the factor which the market is not accounting for is that the company is actively investing in copper production. They recently did a $1 billion acquisition for Australian MAC copper. When we incorporate that into the account; there at least is very good chance that even if current ROE is somewhat compressed, still that would be materially higher than what company had been in normal cycles been able to achieve.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Incorporating both the meaningful peer multiple discount with the copper catalyst, the company looks undervalued at current market price of $21 per share. If the company would not have been investing substantially in copper than current valuation would had been alright, but the market is not very keen on accounting for incremental business improvement resulting from the said expansion along with continued gold mining operations.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business Overview</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Harmony is a gold mining specialist with a growing international copper footprint. Harmony is the South Africa’s largest gold producer by volume and had been in the mining from last 75 years<strong>. </strong>The company operates nine underground and two surface mines in the region. Around 80% of revenue in South African operations comes from underground mining operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720437846998422_origin.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1414\" data-height=\"1302\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720437846998422_origin.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Business Overview\" width=\"640\" height=\"589\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720437846998422_origin.jpeg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720437846998422_origin.jpeg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720437846998422_origin.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720437846998422_origin.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Operational Overview <span>(Company-Integrated Annual Report )</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/64152725-17720835401000228_origin.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1513\" data-height=\"749\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/64152725-17720835401000228_origin.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Segment Info\" width=\"640\" height=\"317\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"317\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/64152725-17720835401000228_origin.jpeg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/64152725-17720835401000228_origin.jpeg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/64152725-17720835401000228_origin.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/64152725-17720835401000228_origin.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Segment Info <span>(Company-Integrated Report)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating Leverage </h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AISC (All-In Sustaining Costs) for Harmony Gold Mining had been around $1800oz on FY25 and the further guidance suggests AISC to come around $2000/oz for FY26. These numbers put Harmony Gold Mining in among top quartile (highest 25%) of global gold producers in terms of cost.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Harmony Gold Mining is basically a high-cost producer of gold. The company with higher production costs sees a greater change in earnings with respect to changes in selling prices or revenue realizations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This keeps the company in a position to benefit much more than the sector averages, in terms of metal price strengthening, while at the same time also exposing the company to greater variability on downside.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial Brief</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Harmony had a liquidity of over $1 billion in FY25 with a <a href=\"https://www.harmony.co.za/media/announcements/2025/fy25-results-final-dividend-28aug2025/#:~:text=Liquidity%20of%20R20%20925%20million%20%28US%241%20179%20million%29%20in%20cash%20and%20undrawn%20facilities\" rel=\"nofollow\">cash balance of $600 Million</a>. The balance sheet gave a comfortable picture with total equity book value of around <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HMY/balance-sheet#:~:text=Print-,Balance%20Sheet,-Period\">$2.7 Billion and a negligible borrowing</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, <a href=\"https://www.harmony.co.za/media/announcements/2025/harmony-completes-mac-copper-acquisition-24oct2025/#:~:text=Harmony%20completes%20MAC%20Copper%20acquisition%2C%20securing%20full%20ownership%20of%20CSA%20mine%20and%20unlocking%20immediate%20copper%20production\" rel=\"nofollow\">post $1 Billion acquisition of MAC Copper</a> which would reflect in balance sheet of later period would add to a little financial leverage since company drew down around $900 million from bridge funding for completing the acquisition. Nevertheless, strong cash generation ability of Harmony would allow it to repay/refinance the loan as and when needed and continue maintaining a good liquidity standing.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key Catalysts</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company recently acquired <a href=\"https://www.harmony.co.za/media/announcements/2025/harmony-completes-mac-copper-acquisition-24oct2025/#:~:text=Harmony%20completes%20MAC%20Copper%20acquisition%2C%20securing%20full%20ownership%20of%20CSA%20mine%20and%20unlocking%20immediate%20copper%20production\" rel=\"nofollow\">MAC COPPER LTD</a>, securing 100% ownership of the high-grade CSA copper mine in New South Wales, Australia. The company paid around $1 Billion for the said acquisition. Considering the total equity capital to be around $2.7 Billion in FY25 and $4.5 billion in total assets — this is a significant capital allocation from the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This not only provides the company direct exposure to the copper production but at the same time delivers the intent of the management to not just be a regional South African gold producer but to become a global commodity producer with international presence. That is not an insignificant leap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Commodity Tailwinds include both gold &amp; copper, which are experiencing an interesting trajectory currently. Being a high operating leverage producer, Harmony Gold Mining stands to benefit directly from sustained strength in gold prices, with incremental price gains flowing directly into top-line and earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Simultaneously, copper expansion positions the company to participate in the structural demand growth in copper.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Perspective</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_8c6c879dc52a25e3b3091257702e8e7a.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_8c6c879dc52a25e3b3091257702e8e7a.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_8c6c879dc52a25e3b3091257702e8e7a.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_8c6c879dc52a25e3b3091257702e8e7a.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current TTM Price multiple is at a discount to around 30% with the sector average as well as rather moderate considering the standalone multiple for Harmony at this time with TTM being just 16x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720289164984462_origin.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"999\" data-height=\"652\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720289164984462_origin.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Multiples\" width=\"640\" height=\"418\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720289164984462_origin.jpeg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720289164984462_origin.jpeg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720289164984462_origin.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720289164984462_origin.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Sector/Peer Comparison <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interestingly the forward multiple according to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HMY/earnings/estimates#:~:text=Jun%202026-,Consensus%20EPS%20Estimates,-3.02\">consensus EPS estimates</a> is just around 8x which is fairly cheap by any mean, even after accounting for higher production costs for Harmony and some regional in-efficiencies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can have a glance at Return on capital to further breakdown the Price to Earnings multiple for Harmony and see, if we can get any rationale from that for current multiples for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_63836ce4f08f6cac47b3937908d0d700.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_63836ce4f08f6cac47b3937908d0d700.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_63836ce4f08f6cac47b3937908d0d700.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_63836ce4f08f6cac47b3937908d0d700.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company, today has a very impressive return on invested capital. Reading ROIC in comparison with P/B and P/E provides an interesting picture and a paradox, however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Price to Earnings is really a variable of reinvestment rate i.e. how much of earnings- the company is able to reinvest in its operations and a return on invested capital it can generate — ROIC/ROE. The fluctuations in either of two would meaningfully affect the ideal price to earnings multiple for the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now while looking into price to earnings alone reflects a fairly cheaper business valuation but when we closely analyze the above chart comparing ROIC and Price to book — this shows that current ROIC of the company is at the highest end. Basically, the market doesn't expect the incremental earnings to be reinvested with similar rate of return. And the market is not entirely incorrect in this assessment. The current Price to book is also on a higher end for a commodity player like a Harmony.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It seems that market also thinks about current higher ROIC to be because of appreciation of gold rather than a structural change in the operations of the company. To put it up in short- the market does not think current ROIC or ROE to be real reflector for the earnings power of the enterprise.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, we have a somewhat peculiar picture: the earnings multiple, when viewed in isolation, either on a standalone basis or relative to peers—appear fairly cheap and compelling; yet, a closer examination of the underlying drivers of those earnings contradicts that assertion .</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't think that the company could redeploy large portion of incremental earnings at this rate of return over the long period of time as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, to conclude this section — it offers an interesting paradox — looking at certain lenses might cause an investor to believe the stock to be significantly undervalued but a closure second order look reflects at-least that might not be the case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, if the copper planning gets executed as per the planning — the valuation case would become quite stronger, but its contingent to the management executions.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk Section</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Harmony, at the end of the day, is a commodity player with revenue and earnings tied to the price of gold and related commodities. Any severe and sustained gold price decline is enough to materially depress both the fundamentals of the business and the market valuations of the shares.<em> </em>Also company earning majorly in USD while cost structure being on ZAR, foreign exchange movements between USD/ZAR can impact the margins on either way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Geographically, operations are concentrated in South Africa, a jurisdiction historically associated with structural issues. including regulatory uncertainty, labour disruptions, and political shifts among others. The company further is not seen well from ESG lenses, being in mining and at the same time human cost resulting due to Harmony's operations cannot be ignored. There would also be many institutions and investors who despite the attractiveness of the company would not invest in the company. The negative perception and political sifts have the potential to materially trouble both the operations of the company and share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, like highlighted above, the company is keen on allocating capital to business expansion than retuning via share buybacks or dividends. While this seems good strategy but it can go other way as well and any misallocation would result in value destruction. This create an execution risk which needs to be actively tracked. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further, the above outlined risks are selective and not exhaustive. As a commodity miner, Harmony remains subject to all other broader risks inherent to the mining industry. </p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Harmony Gold is primarily an investment case on the commodity cycle rather than a purely operationally driven business. The company remains a beneficiary of both strengthening precious metal prices and the structural demand shift toward higher copper consumption, for which it is allocating a sizable amount of capital.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is largely an investment proposition for those who hold a favorable view on the commodity cycle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720406901858397_origin.jpeg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"996\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720406901858397_origin.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Charting\" width=\"640\" height=\"398\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720406901858397_origin.jpeg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720406901858397_origin.jpeg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720406901858397_origin.jpeg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/64152725-17720406901858397_origin.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Comparison <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the last 10 years, Harmony Gold has significantly outperformed SPDR Gold Shares (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLD\" title=\"SPDR Gold Shares ETF\">GLD</a>). While gold has delivered approximately a 3x price return, Harmony has generated nearly a 6x price return over the same period, excluding dividends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For investors constructive on gold, it offers a compelling proposition. However, the company cannot entirely detach itself from commodity fluctuations, nor can it benefit from metal appreciation without being adversely affected if the cycle reverses. Price hedging is not costless and is, at best, a short-term strategic tool. Ultimately, both the company’s performance and share price trajectory will remain contingent on the commodity price cycle.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Opinion</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At a current price of $21.49 it's a buy, but primarily as a proxy for the commodity cycle, majorly gold, and suitable only for those with a favorable view on the yellow metal and copper.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the near term, if we see further material upside in gold, or if the consensus estimate of FY26 EPS of around <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HMY/earnings/estimates#:~:text=Jun%202026-,Consensus%20EPS%20Estimates,-3.02\">$3 per share</a> comes to materialize -there is a reasonable change for the stock to trade at around $25-$30 range from current levels. However, this remains dependent on commodity pricing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, if the commodity cycle continues as it has, the company has the potential to outperform the price returns of both the general stock market indices and even the underlying commodity it produces.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, potential risk needs to be evaluated carefully while committing capital in this company. This remains a probabilistic proposition eventually.</p>",

The stock has been range-bound between $190 and $215, as there has been a battle between excellent current profitability and fears about future margin compression.

That brought full-year earnings to an excellent $34.83. In property-liability, underwriting profits more than doubled to $4 billion thanks to a reserve release and much lower catastrophe losses as its combined ratio improved 14% to 72.9%. In 2025, no major hurricanes hit the mainland U<span>nited States</span>, which is fairly unusual, and this created a very favorable underwriting environment—one that is unlikely to be consistently repeated in my view. This provided a $200 million benefit to underwriting income, but even absent that, we are seeing material profit improvement thanks to improving expenses and strong core underwriting results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Drilling into results, auto underwriting profits tripled to $1.85 billion. Auto premiums earned rose 3% as policy count grew 2%, implying just modest price increases. Since COVID, physical damage costs have increased by 47%, while injury costs rose 52%. This led to a significant increase in auto insurance premiums as profitability was squeezed. Having raised prices substantially, profitability is on a much better footing, to the point where some providers like Progressive (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PGR\" title=\"The Progressive Corporation\">PGR</a>) have to give <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article314805888.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article314805888.html\" target=\"_blank\">rebates</a>. This has raised concerns about deflation and margin compression going forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Auto margin fears are now overdone</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s combined ratio was 81%, down 12.7<span> percentage points</span> from last year. There was also a $715 million benefit from releasing prior-year reserves, as the severity of claims was better than previously modeled. Reserve releases are always good to see, as it means past policies are outperforming modeled expectations, speaking to conservative underwriting assumptions. However, benefits, especially of this magnitude, are more one-time in nature. Still, its run-rate combine ratio was 90.4%, which is excellent. In this sector, I like to see a combined ratio below 95%, so Allstate is outperforming this materially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see below, auto insurance premium inflation has been decelerating for several years since peaking in 2023 above 10%. Premiums tend to lag overall inflation trends since most policies are 6-12 months in nature. This is why the post-COVID inflation spike initially pressured margins, forcing outsized subsequent price increases. As price increases restored margins, that has brought capital back into the market, increasing competition and pressuring prices.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185913512058_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1118\" data-height=\"557\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185913512058_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"line chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"319\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185913512058_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185913512058_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185913512058_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185913512058_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>St. Louis Federal Reserve</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At ~3%, auto premiums are still rising similar to the overall rate of inflation, which should limit potential margin compression. However, the trajectory is the source of concern. If we see premiums continue to decelerate, that could cause underwriting income to narrow (holding cat activity constant; this obviously can vary meaningfully year by year). Margin expansion from current levels on auto policies is highly unlikely; however, with premiums still rising, I believe fears of a significant deterioration in underwriting income are also unlikely. I am targeting 0-150bps of margin erosion this year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other units are performing well</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Homeowners underwriting income was up 69% to $1.8 billion as premiums earned grew 14% to $4.1 billion. Its policy count grew by 2.5% from last year, and we have seen stronger pricing dynamics here relative to auto. Its total combined ratio fell by 14.5% to an excellent 55.3%, though cat losses declined by 46% given the quieter storm season. Still, its underlying combined ratio was 810bps to 51.4%. As the company has been rolling off legacy National General products and shifting to its Allstate-branded policies, we have seen favorable margin trends. Q4 results were unsustainably strong, as there will be hurricanes, but still the underwriting results are excellent.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its smaller Protection Services unit increased revenue 12% to $3.3 billion during 2025, with it reaching $917 million in Q3. Policies in force rose by 3% to $172 million. ALL has been aggressively trying to grow this product warranty business to better diversify its exposures. Importantly, this growth is flowing to the bottom line as ALL widens distribution and improves scale. Net income rose 32% to $49 million in Q4.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Balance sheet supports capital returns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thanks to the favorable interest rate environment, net investment income remains strong at $892 million, up about $60 million from last year. This was primarily due to strength in its fixed income portfolio, as it benefits from reinvesting maturities in the current rate environment. Importantly, Allstate has a high-quality investment portfolio, which now stands at $83.2 billion. About $59 billion of this sits in fixed income, with another $5 billion of cash equivalents.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance-based income actually declined by $21 million to $146 million, and returns were just 6% in 2025. The entire industry has struggled with below-target alternative investment returns as real estate and private equity have lagged, given the elevated rate environment. I expect this to remain the case in 2026, with returns likely to remain below the 8%-12% that needs to be achieved over the medium term to justify the extra capital cost associated with these higher-risk investments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alongside earnings, Allstate <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4547956-allstate-raises-dividend-by-8-to-108\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4547956-allstate-raises-dividend-by-8-to-108\" target=\"_blank\">increased</a> its dividend by 8%, and shares now offer a 2% dividend yield. In addition, the company authorized a new $4 billion repurchase program. Thanks to buybacks, its share count is down about 1.5% from last year, and I expect a faster pace of share count reduction in 2026. Allstate’s holding company, which is the entity that pays the dividend and repurchases stock, maintains an excellent financial position with $7.5 billion of assets. As such, I view its dividend as highly secure.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation is too low, making ALL a \"Buy\"</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in November, I was targeting $22-$24 in 2025 EPS. Core underwriting standards entered this year a bit stronger than I initially hoped, especially in the homeowners’ segment. With the larger buyback, we also may see a faster reduction in the share count than I previously anticipated. As such, assuming a normal cat season (which is really unknowable until Q3), I view EPS as likely to be $23.50-$25.50. This leaves shares around 8.5x earnings, giving ALL a “B-” Seeking Alpha valuation score, though it gets a better score on P/E metrics.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185912633648_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1064\" data-height=\"417\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185912633648_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"stock chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"251\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185912633648_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185912633648_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185912633648_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/13071522-17722185912633648_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This low multiple speaks to the fears about earnings compression. Thus far, though, all signs point to a more modest pace of compression, especially with auto premiums still up. Plus, the more gradual the normalization, the greater the offset to EPS from share buybacks. A shrinking share count can help offset tighter margins while keeping EPS around current levels. Markets are also pricing in some risk about autonomous vehicles reducing insurance demand, though I view this as a very long-term risk in nature.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While valuation is likely to be capped by these factors, I view its current multiple as demonstrably cheap. Whereas much of the sector can trade closer to 12x in my view, I view auto-exposed insurers as likely capped closer to 10x. Still, this points to a ~$240+ fair value. Even with shares at the top of their trading range, I remain a <span>\"B</span>uy.\" If results remain resilient, I believe ALL can break out and reach new highs, making shares an attractive \"Buy\" at current levels.</p>",

In this industry, the market is extremely concentrated, which is why the Index's float-adjusted market-cap-weighting scheme results in more than 45% allocated to just two stocks: Johnson &amp; Johnson (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNJ\" title=\"Johnson &amp; Johnson\">JNJ</a>) and Eli Lilly and Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY\" title=\"Eli Lilly and Company\">LLY</a>).

(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTRS\" title=\"Viatris Inc.\">VTRS</a>), and based on IHE's ~80% allocation to the following top ten holdings, it's a pretty non-diversified product.

As benchmarks today, I'll analyze IHE alongside the iShares U.S. Healthcare ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IYH\" title=\"iShares US Healthcare ETF\">IYH</a>) and the iShares Russell 3000 ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWV\" title=\"iShares Russell 3000 ETF\">IWV</a>), with the goal of highlighting how IHE is fundamentally stronger than the broader Health Care sector and overall market right now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">IHE Performance Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, I want to acknowledge how IHE has significantly lagged behind both benchmarks over the last ten years. As shown below, a $10K investment in IHE on March 1, 2016, would only grow to $23,335 on February 23, 2026, compared to $27,527 and $39,786 for IYH and IWV, respectively. You can see how IHE struggled in the early years, but it's started to gain some ground in recent years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-1771939512521387_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1744\" data-height=\"724\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-1771939512521387_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IHE, IYH, IWV Performance Analysis\" width=\"640\" height=\"266\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-1771939512521387_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-1771939512521387_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-1771939512521387_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-1771939512521387_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor (ETF Performance Analytics Tool)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, IYE is up a solid 7.36% in 2026 compared to almost flat returns for IYH and IWV, and that's followed an impressive 31.68% gain last year that trounced both benchmarks.

In LLY's case, management anticipates increased use of its popular diabetes and obesity drugs (Mounjaro and Zepbound), and in the company's <a href=\"https://investor.lilly.com/static-files/45a92498-43d0-4e2d-a4e6-a9131841cfd6\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q4 Investor Presentation</a>, noted EPS guidance in the $33.50-$35.00 range, which represents ~41% growth.

The following table, which highlights growth rates for IHE's top ten holdings, show that the portfolio's next-year sales and earnings growth rates of 11.88% and 19.07% are in line with their three-year rates, so I don't think it's overly aggressive. However, the same can't be said for IYH and IWV. Their next-year EPS growth rates are above their three-year annualized averages, which might flag that they're unsustainable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719652397001808_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1757\" data-height=\"538\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719652397001808_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IHE Top Ten Holdings - Growth and Valuation Metrics\" width=\"640\" height=\"196\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719652397001808_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719652397001808_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719652397001808_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719652397001808_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Sunday Investor (ETF Snapshots Tool)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Johnson &amp; Johnson, Eli Lilly, and Merck &amp; Co. are relatively expensive for the Health Care sector based on their P/E ratios. However, IHE still has plenty of other cheaper stocks to balance things out, including Pfizer, which trades at just 9.00x forward earnings. When combining each ETF's forward P/E and one-year estimated EPS growth rates, IHE easily comes out on top, hence, my conclusion that it's a terrific GARP ETF.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>IHE: 15.69x / 19.07% = 0.82x</li> <li>IYH: 18.96x / 16.60% = 1.14x</li> <li>IWV: 22.18x / 17.60% = 1.26x</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, it's a bonus that many of IHE's top holdings have excellent EPS Revision Grades from Seeking Alpha. Shares of Johnson &amp; Johnson and Eli Lilly are up 40% and 47%, respectively, over the last six months, and with high-growth stocks like these, it's crucial that analyst earnings forecasts trend upward to sustain price momentum and avoid the price-multiple compression that often plagues high P/E stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719658828991919_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1779\" data-height=\"344\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719658828991919_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IHE Quant Factor Grades - High EPS Revisions Scores For U.S. Pharmaceutical Stocks\" width=\"640\" height=\"124\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719658828991919_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719658828991919_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719658828991919_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/51194860-17719658828991919_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">IHE: Growth Potential Beyond Eli Lilly</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since Eli Lilly is expected to be IHE's main earnings growth driver for at least the next several years, it's reasonable to consider just owning it individually and skipping IHE's 0.38% expense ratio. However, M&amp;A activity trends and expectations are good for the entire pharmaceuticals industry, so it's not the best strategy to tie your success to a single company whose earnings growth is expected to be roughly <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY/valuation/price-earnings-peg-ratios\">127% in aggregate</a> over the next four years. The potential for negative earnings surprises will be present each quarter, and based on my general investment philosophy, that will impact high P/E stocks like LLY the most.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Turning back to M&amp;A activity, <a href=\"https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/as-big-pharmas-next-patent-cliff-looms-biotech-investors-see-dollar-signs\" rel=\"noopener\">Pitchbook</a> notes how a patent cliff is looming, with \"some $180 billion in pharma revenue\" going off patent in 2027-2028. That should spur an increase in deals to replenish lost revenues. Furthermore, IHE is market-cap-weighted, and based on data from Seeking Alpha, its top ten holdings control roughly 80% of the cash on hand in the industry ($78 billion/$90 billion). That means several other stocks, particularly Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Pfizer Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>), are well-positioned to benefit from increased M&amp;A activity.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table class=\"table-striped\"> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td>Ticker</td> <td>IHE Weight</td> <td>Total Cash (MRQ)</td> <td>Cash % in IHE</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNJ/balance-sheet\">JNJ</a></td> <td>24.84%</td> <td>$20,102,000,000</td> <td>21.62%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LLY/balance-sheet\">LLY</a></td> <td>21.40%</td> <td>$7,268,000,000</td> <td>7.82%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRK/balance-sheet\">MRK</a></td> <td>5.19%</td> <td>$18,214,000,000</td> <td>19.59%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BMY/balance-sheet\">BMY</a></td> <td>4.89%</td> <td>$10,673,000,000</td> <td>11.48%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTRS/balance-sheet\">VTRS</a></td> <td>4.72%</td> <td>$1,157,100,000</td> <td>1.24%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZTS/balance-sheet\">ZTS</a></td> <td>4.48%</td> <td>$2,312,000,000</td> <td>2.49%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RPRX/balance-sheet\">RPRX</a></td> <td>4.35%</td> <td>$637,496,000</td> <td>0.69%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE/balance-sheet\">PFE</a></td> <td>4.33%</td> <td>$14,986,000,000</td> <td>16.12%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ELAN/balance-sheet\">ELAN</a></td> <td>3.21%</td> <td>$505,000,000</td> <td>0.54%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JAZZ/balance-sheet\">JAZZ</a></td> <td>2.64%</td> <td>$2,046,074,000</td> <td>2.20%</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Recommendation</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IHE is a $1 billion U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF with excellent GARP features. On one side, roughly half the portfolio is comprised of high-growth stocks like Eli Lilly, while the other half includes cheaper ones like Pfizer. It's this balance that's appealing, and that's reflected in portfolio-level metrics like 19.07% one-year estimated EPS growth rate and a 15.69x forward P/E ratio. Seeking Alpha also reports high earnings revision scores for many of its top holdings, and these are good reasons why IHE is currently on a nine-month winning streak and has easily outperformed the market over the last year. Therefore, due to its solid fundamentals and my optimistic M&amp;A outlook for the pharmaceuticals industry, I've assigned IHE a \"buy\" rating, and I hope to keep the conversation going with you in the comments section below. Thank you for reading.</p>",

While the firm increased prices by 4% and also benefited from currency tailwinds - 2% - the soft demand for their products significantly outweighed these benefits. Volume was down by as much as 7% year-over-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, the soft demand was, however, limited to the tools and outdoor segment only. Revenue in tools and outdoor fell by 2% year-over-year, driven by soft demand all around the globe. Especially power tool demand was weak. Volume in the segment fell by as much as 9%. On the other hand, the engineered fastening segment performed relatively well. Volume was up 7%, prices were up 1%, and currency tailwinds were 1%. The demand was primarily driven by the strength in the aerospace and automotive industries.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721279492939558_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2532\" data-height=\"1400\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721279492939558_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"354\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721279492939558_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721279492939558_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721279492939558_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721279492939558_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Segment results <span>(Stanley Black &amp; Decker)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Two other positive things for the quarter need to be highlighted here. First, margins; second, debt. SWK managed to expand its adjusted gross margin to 33.3% from 31.2% in the prior year as a result of increased prices, tariff mitigation, and reduced supply chain costs. When it comes to debt, it is very promising to see how disciplined the firm is in terms of debt reduction. Over the past 2 years, net debt to adjusted EBITDA declined from 5.9x to 3.4x, supported by the firm's free cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-1772127988738517_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2538\" data-height=\"1420\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-1772127988738517_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"slide\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-1772127988738517_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-1772127988738517_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-1772127988738517_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-1772127988738517_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Margins and debt <span>(Stanley Black &amp; Decker)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let us look a bit forward now, and let us try to formulate some expectations. When it comes to the consumer, we cannot say that there is much to be optimistic about. Consumer confidence slightly increased this year, but not meaningfully. We are still close to the 10-year lows. As long as sentiment is poor, I do not see a significant increase in demand for SWK's products on the horizon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721304240380728_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1976\" data-height=\"1004\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721304240380728_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"325\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721304240380728_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721304240380728_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721304240380728_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721304240380728_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">U.S. Consumer sentiment <span>(tradingeconomics.com)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to the industry, things look a bit better. The ISM Manufacturing PMI has been staying below 50 for quite a while now, but in January the reading went well above 50, the first time at this level since mid-2022. A reading below 50 means that the manufacturing economy is generally declining, while a reading above 50 indicates expansion. If the reading were to stay at the current levels for a sustained period of time, I believe SWK could benefit from the potential industry expansion tailwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721305292855217_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1970\" data-height=\"1114\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721305292855217_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"362\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721305292855217_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721305292855217_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721305292855217_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721305292855217_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ISM Manufacturing <span>(tradingeconomics.com)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to the firm's own expectations, they foresee a mid-single-digit growth in the long term, but these expectations should be reflected only in the 2028 financials.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTR\" title=\"Nutrien Ltd.\">NTR</a></span>). This is a company I haven't reviewed in over 4 years, and I no longer own stock. My previous article from 2021<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> can be </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4464289-nutrien-stock-valuation-opportunity-now\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">found here</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> - but given that the thesis at the time was \"broken\" when the company appreciated very significantly, I sold out of that position after only a few months of holding it.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fertilizer and agricultural chemicals, as well as related pesticides and seed technologies, are very volatile sectors. Why?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because they reflect the very volatile underlying tendencies in a volatile agriculture and chemical market. To expect these companies to be anything but volatile would be to expect them to go against their natural tendencies, as with most basic materials or energy stocks, which are equally correlated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That doesn't mean they are not attractive, or cannot be attractive investments. They certainly can, and are, under the right type of circumstance. That's what I invest in, have invested in in the past, and will continue to invest in going forward. But the return, as well as how the company has performed over time (the volatility is what I am referring to here), highlights the importance of a valuation-oriented approach to ensure that you do not \"stay\" in a company when it is overvalued.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I'll do here is provide a thorough business update for Nutrien, look at what the company might deliver going forward, given the macro situation (this is very important when it comes to fertilizers and agriculture), and what, if any, alternatives there are to invest in here. Alternatives are important. I believe the acceptable \"spread\" in terms of PT/FV here are fairly low, and given also the general state of market overvaluation, you want to keep things relatively \"tight\" here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's see what we have for Nutrien in 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nutrien: A reflection of the issues and challenges in global fertilizers</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some significant news that seems to have not been highlighted all that much here on SA happened in mid-December of 2025. The relevance to these sorts of macro news is reflected in the company's volatile trends since that time, as well as the outlook that we have for Nutrien going forward. As a result of U.S./Belarus deals about potash sanctions, Nutrien's stock fell about 4% during the day of the news - but this only adds to what I already believe is a complex thesis for fertilizer globally here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fact that the U.S. and other countries beholden by U.S. sanctions have <em>not imported Belarusian potash</em> has meant a meaningful advantage for Nutrien and other native producers of Potash. Other producers worth noting here are Mosaic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MOS\" title=\"The Mosaic Company\">MOS</a>), which I also cover from time to time. These sanctions have been in place for almost 3-4 years, so when they were cancelled, it means reintroduction of a fair bit of capacity that until that point was curtailed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Part of the reason why I was able to sell Nutrien at such record high levels was due to significant pricing increases for potash, in part related to exactly those trends. Potash has trended between $280-$350 per metric tonne or so for past period. The current price estimate is between $320 and $345 for the full year - my own forecasts, due to more capacity online, is at $310.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Potash has a current advantage relative to alternatives like nitrogen or phosphate, which are currently more expensive, and with farmer margins being pressured, it's easy to understand that farmers are prioritizing soil health (which potash helps with). There are also the macro considerations that current stockpiles in both China and India for the coming year are relatively low. If Potash drops under, say $300/share, and Nutrien drops as a result of this, then I would probably be interested in buying more. The reason would be that potash would have gotten too cheap at that time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nutrien operates both in NA and also has a significant market share in Brazil. The fact that it's not the biggest Chinese producer doesn't matter. What we're looking at is a global market - trends affect these companies, even if they are not in those markets to begin with. The fact that Nutrien is also a world leader in fertilizers like Nitrogen and phosphorus is another reason to be both positive and careful - even an upside in one might not weigh up the downside in another.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Arguments for investing in Nutrien, as in other crop and fertilizer companies, are timeless. You have the \"arable land\" argument, which is that the amount of land only shrinks. You have macro trends like urbanization and the like, and this has led to an assumption that we'll see a demand/supply crunch where demand would significantly outpace the current available supply, or even planned supply additions. if this was to be the case, then yes - what we have here is a potential for appeal, provided we get it cheap enough.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A big reason that I'm a bit more positive on potash than others, is that I see a demand potential in <em>both China and India. </em>These countries currently use less potash in farming than is being scientifically recommended to maintain soil health. To balance this, I consider it likely that we'll see an increase in use of Potash, which the countries will be unable to handle by themselves. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At heart, Nutrien is a qualitative business. The company is BBB rated, it has a very solid yield, even if that yield is only 3.1% (meaning in terms of yield safety), and its business model has for some time ensured that it's not generally subject to the same sort of volatile ups and downs that the remainder of the sector. At least, the company has fewer of them. Back in 2023, profits dropped by over 60%, but this was part of a similar trend across most of the fertilizer space - so that's not surprising.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect that Potash will continue to generate about 30% of the company's EBIT over time. Part of the favorable outlook on Potash for Nutrien specifically is that most of the company's product is mined at low cost with very solid circumstances in Canada. Nitrogen is trickier, due to the correlation to NatGas prices. I don't expect a significant advantage from the phosphate business - its cost curve relative to other producers is middling, which means this is the least important of the company's business segments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-177219519702201_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1596\" data-height=\"846\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-177219519702201_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nutrien Investor Presentation 2026 IR\" width=\"640\" height=\"339\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-177219519702201_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-177219519702201_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-177219519702201_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-177219519702201_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Nutrien Investor Presentation 2026 IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, 2025 was a good performance year for the company. Nutrien report growth in sales for fertilizers, better earnings, and continued solid execution of its performance program.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's 13% increase in EBITDA is worth highlighting here, related to record sales for the company, thanks to good growth from most of the key areas. Headwinds and \"weights\" on results continue to be things like overall crop protection products and an upswing in expenses. The company has delivered 2026E estimates, with a range of about $1.95B on the high end for EBIITDA, marking another significant increase in the company's bottom line - at least potentially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721954607756705_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1674\" data-height=\"840\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721954607756705_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nutrien Investor Presentation 2026 IR\" width=\"640\" height=\"321\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721954607756705_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721954607756705_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721954607756705_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721954607756705_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Nutrien Investor Presentation 2026 IR</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason why I think this estimate is just a bit too positive overall is the state of the market. The entire bull case for Nutrien hinges on the assumption that potash will continue to be a cost-effective alternative for farmers looking to fertilize as opposed to other fertilizers. I would argue, as some other analysts do as well, that one might be missing the forest for the trees with this argument. That \"forest\" argument is that <em>income for agriculture is down, and given inflation and costs doesn't seem to go back up. </em>Normalized prices for core seeds and grains, such as corn have actually dropped. If we instead of a demand growth work with a <em>demand decline</em>, then the picture for Nutrien would very quickly look different. Furthermore, with the company's new project (it's called Jansen, in Canada), it remains uncertain how much the company is actually capable of raising its prices, given the significant amount of capacity that this brings to the table.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Oh, and if Russia comes back to the world market, then I would say that \"bets are off\" in terms of forecast - even if on paper, those exports already have seen <a href=\"https://tadviser.com/index.php/Article:Export_and_import_of_fertilizers_in_Russia#:~:text=According%20to%20Vedomosti%2C%20the%20largest,3%25%20to%204.8%20million%20tons.\" rel=\"nofollow\">a bit of recovery.</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To say that the market and industry is complex, is therefore a bit of an understatement. What I would remember is the following. Russia, Belarus and Canada represent <em>over 75% of global potash. </em>The geopolitical macro has delivered a very good situation for Nutrien when these were \"locked out,\" but this is now normalizing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would be careful how I value the company going forward.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation for Nutrien - two ways to see it and how I see it</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This will be for the U.S. ticker NTR, so all amounts and estimates will be made in USD. My assumption is that Nutrien's AEPS growth will be less than expected. Following solid results in 2025, I don't think we'll see upside going forward - flat, negative or at best 1-2% AEPS growth on a forward basis. That means that I don't want to overpay for Nutrien or put the company really at any sort of premium multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's average is 15x. I'm fine with that multiple, even if it might in some instances be too high for what the company offers here. At 15.13, the company's long-term average, your rate of annualized return is less than 10%/year for me, working with a fair value target of about $72/share, meaning slightly below the target we have at the time of submission of this article.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721962717321513_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1464\" data-height=\"1352\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721962717321513_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Nutrien Upside F.A.S.T graphs\" width=\"640\" height=\"591\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721962717321513_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721962717321513_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721962717321513_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49836612-17721962717321513_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Nutrien Upside F.A.S.T graphs <span>(Nutrien Upside F.A.S.T graphs)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The way that I see it is as follows. If you want to argue for a higher multiple or higher growth, you <em>have to assume success in the company's higher-level ambitions or macro assumptions. </em>Those that I spoke about in the section previously. Essentially, if you don't (like me) believe that these are likely, then the conclusion should be that you may want to be conservative on this company and its forecasts and future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I want if I am to invest here is a <em>discount that beats the market even in the event of a bearish turnout.</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So that is what I am looking for. I find this representation of a break in potash and general fertilizer assumptions by applying a $69/share fair value, with a price target, or PT, of $56/share. My valuation target works with an assumption of $300/mt of Potash pricing, but with a margin contraction from lower farmer returns. Unless I get that PT, I'm not interested in investing here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nutrien is saying that fundamentals are improving and that demand is good. My counterpoint to this is that it's not as good as they are presenting, and I believe risks to be higher than this, as presented above. So, fair value target of $69/share with a midpoint retail EBITDA target of $1.7B at most, with contraction due to macro difficulties, at which point, I'd be willing to invest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second way to view it, to tie back to the header for this portion, is that you assume the <em>company's assumptions materialize. </em>In this scenario, I could easily see a fair value closer to $75-$80/share.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks &amp; Considerations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aside from risks mentioned above, what I would add is the historical validation from the volatility in commodities as well as crop nutrients. The past few years have been volatile for sure, and there's no real sign that this is about to change - I wouldn't want to be the investor who argues the market is getting \"more stable\" here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I simply think it's a hard argument to make that Nutrien will be able to, over time, outperform the pricing trends set to be brought about by the supply additions that we're likely to see.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For that reason, I'm more conservative than many investors seem to be here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I consider Nutrien to be one of several interesting fertilizer companies, together with investments I've made in Yara (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/YARIY\" title=\"Yara International ASA\">YARIY</a>), Mosaic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MOS\" title=\"The Mosaic Company\">MOS</a>), and companies like K+S (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KPLUY\" class=\"ticker-link\">KPLUY)</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, one of the things about fertilizers is that these companies are exposed to very volatile macro and commodity tendencies. Furthermore, the recent years have seen supply exclusion, which is now being \"added back\" - and this, together with the compressed margins for farmers, which works against the positive assumptions being made for the sector, means that I'm more neutral/bearish than I am bullish here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using conservative metrics and assumptions, I put a $56/share PT on Nutrien based on a $69/share FV as of February 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em>This company is overall qualitative.</em></li> <li><em>This company is fundamentally safe/conservative &amp; well-run.</em></li> <li><em>This company pays a well-covered dividend.</em></li> <li>This company is currently cheap.</li> <li>This company has a realistic upside that is high enough, based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion.</li> </ul> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company fulfills 3 out of 3 quality indicators, and 0 out of 2 valuation indicators. That means 3/5 \"stars\" here, which typically isn't enough. Based on this, and a price target of $56/share, I see a risk/reward-adjusted upside that's attractive enough for me. I give the company a Hold rating as of February 2026.</p>",
