With tenant defaults in 2025 and cannabis rescheduling uncertain, the share price remains depressed, but I think the valuation is finally attractive.</p> <h2>Summary of Previous<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> Thesis</span> </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The first time I covered this company was almost two years ago, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4692948-innovative-industrial-properties-fair-price-no-signs-of-recreating-its-past\">in May 2024</a>. At the time, IIPR was still a cannabis pure play, by way of its REIT structure. General sentiment about cannabis at that time was positive, but I declined to rate their shares a Buy. I did acknowledge the positives that came with this investment:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Listing on a major exchange, rare for any cannabis company</li> <li>First mover as a cannabis REIT</li> <li>Steady profits</li> <li>Low-risk, triple-net leasing model</li> <li>Virtually zero debt</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I largely felt that IIPR lacked room for growth, with much of the cannabis market developed at that time. I wrote:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Cannabis continues to be a popular search among stocks for outsized returns on waves of legalization. With IIP, a honeymoon of vertical growth rates seems to be behind it, and there are no obvious catalysts to this company taking off. Rather, it will be a game of managing the current portfolio and working with tenants to improve the properties, while incrementally adding new tenants as more layers of legalization come down and bring more growth into the industry.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It just didn't seem discounted for what seemed likely to be slower growth ahead, hence my Hold rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strategic Adjustment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cannabis investing depends heavily on politics. Former optimism hinged on the Biden Administration's intentions to reschedule cannabis as a Schedule III substance under the Controlled Substances Act. This would pose enormous tax benefits, improving the cash flow for tenants across IIPR's portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Biden's exit from the 2024 election and Harris's defeat created much more uncertainty on this, and previous rescheduling efforts halted under Trump. Cyclical factors, <a href=\"https://www.supplychainbrain.com/articles/42797-behind-the-us-cannabis-industrys-oversupply-battle\" rel=\"nofollow\">such as oversupply</a> and <a href=\"https://www.blankrome.com/publications/cannabis-industrys-6-billion-debt-wall\" rel=\"nofollow\">upcoming debt maturities</a>, weakened many operators. IIPR therefore announced <a href=\"https://investors.innovativeindustrialproperties.com/news/news-details/2025/Innovative-Industrial-Properties-Announces-Strategic-and-Diversifying-270-Million-Investment-in-Life-Science-Real-Estate-Platform-08-06-2025/default.aspx\" rel=\"noopener\">a strategic pivot</a> in August 2025. They would be diversifying into life sciences, not longer purely owning and acquiring cannabis properties.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It indicated the limited growth available to cannabis that I worried was present. Management finally seemed to concur and acted accordingly. Unlike their cannabis portfolio, which consists of directly owned assets, the shift into life sciences is done through investment in IQHQ, Inc., a life sciences real estate platform. The two primary investment vehicles entail:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Providing a $100M credit facility at 13.5% interest</li> <li>Purchase of $170M of IQHQ's preferred stock at a 15% yield</li> <li>(Thirdly, conditional warrants to buy equity in IQHQ)</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Put in simple terms, IIPR is acting as equity REIT in cannabis and mortgage REIT in life sciences with this shift.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Full-Year 2025 Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The full-year results and <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001677576/0d690613-d8b8-49aa-853f-281255fb9d51.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">latest Form 10K</a> illustrate the issues that hit IIPR's portfolio.

In their MD&amp;A section, management explained:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The decrease was primarily driven by tenant defaults, resulting in a decrease of $46.9 million related to properties leased to PharmaCann, Gold Flora, TILT, and 4Front.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The cash flow statement, however, shows some subtle changes between 2024's and 2025's results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720551655402093.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Screenshot\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"619\" height=\"224\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720551655402093.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720551655402093.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720551655402093.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cash Flow Statement (2025 Form 10K)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Common share distributions remained steady in 2025, in spite of this sharp stress on the portfolio.

The $102M credit facility to support the life sciences segment is also apparent. That the reported assets did not grow with the contribution of the credit facility is not, as one might think, primarily a consequence of realized losses or asset impairments. The income statement shows that normal depreciation and amortization accounted for this.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720559523353648_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1395\" data-height=\"596\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720559523353648_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Screenshot\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"273\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720559523353648_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720559523353648_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720559523353648_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720559523353648_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Q4 2025 Investor Presentation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Coming into 2026, IIPR is still primarily a cannabis REIT, but life sciences became 6.6% of its portfolio in less than a year. It is still primarily a REIT and business exposed to the strengths and weakness of cannabis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook and Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I wrote about IIPR the first time, it was valued $107 per share, had market cap over $3B, and a dividend yield of about 6.5%. Now, it's $53, has a market cap of $1.4B, and dividend yield of 14.8%. Just on valuation alone, it's a very different prospect, but we still need to assess if it's a good price, taking into account the changed fundamentals and the outlook they support.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, how sustainable in the $7.60 annual dividend? Let's look at how IIPR breaks down its FFO, normalized FFO, and adjusted FFO.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-1772066042575258_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"881\" data-height=\"468\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-1772066042575258_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Screenshot\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-1772066042575258_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-1772066042575258_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-1772066042575258_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-1772066042575258_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Breakdown of FFOs (2025 Form 10K)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We see that FFO removes changes related to asset values, NFFO removes one-off cash items, and AFFO removes some other non-cash expenses.

During the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874064-innovative-industrial-properties-inc-iipr-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a>, Executive Chairman Alan Gold gave positive outlook on the dividend but fell short of confirming coverage:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Well, I think, first of all, the dividend -- our dividend policy is set by our Board, and they review what has occurred in the past and the projections going forward. But what we're seeing is this return to growth, and we're seeing strong re-leasing activity, which is driving revenues. And we continue to see -- and we have the resolutions of some of these major lease or major litigations. And with those resolutions and the activity -- the leasing activity we're seeing, we continuously feel positive about where we are with regards to our dividend.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's very plausible that the dividend could be trimmed a bit (perhaps as low as $7.00) if upcoming quarters have enough non-recurring cash expenses. Even so, that's still about a 13% yield on cost, giving IIPR something of a risk premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An example of non-recurring cash items may include refinancing the 2026 notes, which come due this May. In the Form 10K, management stated:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>As of December 31, 2025, the outstanding principal balance on our Notes due 2026 was $291.2 million and we plan to refinance these notes prior to maturity in May 2026.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">No announcement has been made, but the Form 10K also mentions that these notes were issued in 2021, when interest rates were much lower and when IIPR was given an investment-grade credit rating. The rating is intact, but interest rates are up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720683452147272_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"861\" data-height=\"276\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720683452147272_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Screenshot\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"205\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720683452147272_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720683452147272_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720683452147272_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/59452134-17720683452147272_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">US 5Y Note (Seeking Alpha)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming another five-year issue, the 5Y Note (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US5Y\" class=\"ticker-link\">US5Y</a>) rose from about 0.80% to 3.63%, more recently. As the 2026 notes bear 5.5% interest, it's conceivable they would need to be refinanced at 8%. With a $291M balance, that would be a $7.2M annual difference, plus a few million related to underwriting and repurchasing the old notes. With AFFO already too low at $205M for 2025, this friction doesn't help. The concern isn't in ability to refinance, so much as it is the higher cost of capital going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I am less worried about the durability of their cannabis portfolio than before. This is because President Trump announced in December, for the first time, that he was <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/increasing-medical-marijuana-and-cannabidiol-research/\" rel=\"nofollow\">committed to rescheduling</a> cannabis to Schedule III. While the long-term pacing of this is still unclear, it bodes well for these assets, whose tenants have been in a cyclical rut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This improvement, plus the substantially lower valuation (14.8% dividend, 7x AFFO multiple), make IIPR worth upgrading to Buy. Nevertheless, let's keep in mind a major <strong>risk factor</strong>, besides any implicit to a dividend trim.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Several of their major tenants have significant debt and questionable cash flow to repay it:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Ascend Wellness Holdings (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAWH\" title=\"Ascend Wellness Holdings, Inc.\">AAWH</a>)</li> <li>Curaleaf (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CURLF\" title=\"Curaleaf Holdings, Inc.\">CURLF</a>)</li> <li>Cannabit (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CBSTF\" title=\"The Cannabist Company Holdings Inc.\">CBSTF</a>)</li> <li>4Front (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FFNTF\" title=\"4Front Ventures Corp.\">FFNTF</a>) (This is <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/4front-initiates-bankruptcy-and-insolvency-act-proceedings-in-canada-302478172.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">in receivership</a>)</li> <li>Cresco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRLBF\" title=\"Cresco Labs Inc.\">CRLBF</a>)</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are five that have publicly available financial data and account for 36.1% of the portfolio's ABR. If they all become distressed, then IIPR would have to worry about more than a trimmed dividend. Depending on how soon Trump reschedules cannabis, many of these companies could end up in a similar spot as 4Front, leading to defaults and lack of payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IIPR can find new tenants among better-capitalized operators in the industry, but this would take time, possibly eliminating the dividend in the meantime.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The risk to IIPR's cannabis properties still loom and have, in part, materialized. The high-yield investments in life sciences, unexpected tailwinds from rescheduling under Trump, and heavily reduced valuation, however, make the shares more attractive than before. With the dividend now more properly representing a risk premium, I upgrade IIPR to Buy.</p>",

At the same time, however, the fact that the absolute number of those unemployed remains<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> above the politically important 3 million is anything but good news. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate remained unchanged at 6.3%.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">No turning point in sight yet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the last four years, German unemployment has increased by some 500,000. This gradual worsening reflects textbook economics; with the economy effectively stagnating for more than five years and industry facing severe structural challenges, a deterioration in the labour market was inevitable. At the same time, employment has started to gradually drop since last summer, providing additional evidence of a structurally changing labour market: a shrinking working force due to demographics, sectoral and geographical shifts due to the industrial transition and higher entrance barriers for graduates due to AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, the number of vacancies has come down further and even if employment plans in both manufacturing and services have started to rebound, we see the gradual worsening of the labour market continuing throughout the year. Previous and potential additional announcements of cost-cutting measures across the automotive and other industries as well as the continuing increase in bankruptcies suggest that conditions will first worsen before they improve. The AI disruption of the labour market could add to this. If we are right and the cyclical recovery of the German economy unfolds over the coming months, the labour market, however, should stabilise towards the end of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, today's labour market report sends a mixed message but definitely no signs of a turning point. Instead, the gradual worsening looks set to continue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Since its publication, the Ashtead share price has moved up 23%. (Since that piece was<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> published, as part of ongoing portfolio reallocation, I have sold my stake in Ashtead).</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With its primary listing due to move to New York next month, alongside plans to host an investor day in the city, now seems like an apposite time to provide a snapshot of the company’s health.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Basic Investment Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In June, and previous pieces, I set out what I see as the investment thesis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plant rental is a large market and one that benefits from some attractive economic characteristics. Demand can often be high, contracts can stretch for months or years, specialist requirements can make some customers effectively captives. Ashtead has rolled up lots of smaller businesses over the years and also taken a strategic approach to business building. That has given it economies of scale and attractive profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One ongoing risk, though, is the inherently cyclical nature of plant rental. As the economy weakens and construction activity reduces, rental providers like Ashtead can be left holding the baby in terms of having lots of capital tied up in pricy plant that lies idle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What sets Ashtead apart from many rivals, in my view, is how strategic it has been about growing the business, through a series of strategic growth plans. In my prior piece, I reckoned that Ashtead was undervalued given its proven business model and North American focus.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Financial Year Shows Modest Revenue Growth but Reduced Profitability</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In December, the company released its <a href=\"https://www.ashtead-group.com/newsroom/news/2025/unaudited-results-for-the-half-year-and-second-quarter-ended-31-october-2025/\" rel=\"nofollow\">results for the first half of its current financial year</a>. These were fine at the top line, though less impressive at the bottom line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenues rose 1% year-on-year, but a 9% decline in operating profit fed through to a 10% fall in pre-tax profit. Revenue performance was the same across both the first and second quarter, but those profit metrics were both sequentially worse in the second quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17720824767495081_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"967\" data-height=\"405\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17720824767495081_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Ashtead interim results topline\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"268\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17720824767495081_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17720824767495081_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17720824767495081_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/51578875-17720824767495081_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Company interim results announcement</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company struck an upbeat note about current demand, saying that it continued to see “positive leading indicators for local non-residential construction activity”. It also launched a new $1.5bn share buyback, which I see as a strong sign of management confidence coming hot on the heels of $714m of buybacks in the first half.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the full year, the company is guiding for rental revenue growth of 0%-4%, and free cash flow of $2.2bn-$2.5bn. That compares favourably to last year’s free cash inflow of $1.8bn.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Can Ashtead Step Up a Gear?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the long run, Ashtead has performed phenomenally well. It is up 6,410% since the start of 2010, for example.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But the current outlook feels more like “steady as she goes” rather than transformative to the investment case. Meanwhile, an uncertain outlook for the U.S. economy and therefore for the construction market in general (and the plant rental market within it specifically) poses a risk to revenues and profits over the coming years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have outlined in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4761832-ashtead-long-term-drivers-remain-positive\">previous pieces</a> on the name that the company’s strategic plans have helped it perform very well in the past and I expect the same of its current plan (<a href=\"https://www.ashtead-group.com/about-us/strategic-review/our-strategic-priorities/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunbelt 4.0</a>). Indeed, in its interim results the company specifically noted, “As we execute on Sunbelt 4.0, we expect a number of years of strong earnings and free cash flow generation”. Ashtead’s free cash flow generation is substantial and I do think it has the potential to keep that flowing if the construction market holds up. As it points out, having invested heavily in infrastructure under its previous strategic plan, it is now trying to make the most of that infrastructure to generate revenues and, thereby, cash flow.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But while I like the business, see it as very well run and also appreciate the financial potential of Sunbelt 4.0, I do not see transformational growth drivers in the coming year or two. The fact that the year’s outlook for rental revenue has at its bottom end a flat year-on-year performance underlines that point I feel.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Does Not Now Look Compelling</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently Ashtead’s price-to-earnings ratio is 22, which is a bit steeper than I would like to find it attractive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the interim point, net debt was $10.5bn. The current market cap is $29.7bn, making for an enterprise value of $40.2bn. Last year’s cash flow from operating activities was $2.2bn. I expect this year’s may be higher given the company’s guidance on cash flow overall, but using last year’s number, the current enterprise value is around 18 times operating cash flow. Again, I do not find that especially attractive but I do at least think it is justifiable for a proven company with ongoing growth potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect the switch to a primary listing in New York City to give the share price some benefit as it will help it to access deeper liquidity more easily, in an end market that anyway accounts for most of its business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, as outlined above, I see current share price as reasonable rather than attractive to start a position and accordingly, on valuation grounds, am downgrading my rating from “buy” to “hold”.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Yes, investors can and should recognise the monetary and fundamental forces that have driven markets higher – especially with more easing on the way in 2026. But stretched valuations and persistent macro risks demand caution, emphasising the need for diversified portfolios. As geopolitics and shifting US policies continue to impact asset allocation, we believe there should be a focus on quality assets, such as gold.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bonds, a no-go?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Much of the optimistic growth outlook for this year rests on the expectation that the US fiscal impulse will turn positive. In such a scenario, inflation is the biggest potential spoiler, particularly as US core PCE inflation is already proving sticky at around 3%. The fact that there is very little slack in the US economy clearly adds to this risk. Indeed, the US economy has been running above its potential growth rate for much of the past four years, and the output gap is now near past highs; historically, such scenarios put sustained upward pressure on consumer price inflation (Chart 7).</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart 7: Inflation worries are justified</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>US inflation expectations, US core inflation and output gap*</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721873919858797_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1173\" data-height=\"443\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721873919858797_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart 7: Inflation worries are justified\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"242\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721873919858797_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721873919858797_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721873919858797_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721873919858797_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">*Data from 31 December 1985 to 31 December 2025.

In other words, the bond market is not out of the woods, and another cyclical upleg in developed market yields could be in the offing. And while a clear turn towards policy hawkishness could curb gold demand in the near term due to a higher opportunity cost, gold should be supported in the medium term via stronger inflation-hedging demand and a higher stock-bond correlation (Chart 8).</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart 8: Bonds are not as effective as they used to be</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>US Treasuries and gold performance during equity drawdowns*</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721874147084856_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1177\" data-height=\"427\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721874147084856_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart 8: Bonds are not as effective as they used to be\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"232\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721874147084856_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721874147084856_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721874147084856_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721874147084856_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">*Data from January 2014 to 31 January 2026. <span>(Sources: Bloomberg, ICE Benchmark Administration, World Gold Council)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, gold can still perform its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4753332-gold-strategic-asset-2025-edition\" rel=\"noopener\">strategic role</a> despite the big rally we have witnessed over the last several years.

Margin debt reflects the amount of funds that investors borrow from their brokers to purchase equities. It typically tracks the performance of the S&amp;P 500, which makes intuitive sense since rising stock prices produce confidence about future equity returns and encourage investors to take on more risk (Chart 10).</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart 10: Building financial speculation</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>US margin debt and S&amp;P 500 y/y*</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721874982918653_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1164\" data-height=\"439\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721874982918653_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart 10: Building financial speculation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"241\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721874982918653_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721874982918653_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721874982918653_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721874982918653_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">*Data from January 1997 to December 2025. <span>(Sources: Bloomberg, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), MRB, World Gold Council)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And while growth in margin debt does not necessarily signal an impending peak in the stock market, it is an indication of increasing financial speculation and growing risks to market stability. In fact, there have only been three occasions when the y/y growth of margin debt has exceeded the 12-month return of the S&amp;P 500 by a similar or larger magnitude, as it did in December (Chart 11). This recent surge in margin debt reinforces the notion that there is scope for greater equity market volatility in the year ahead.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart 11: Excessive increases in margin debt have preceded equity bear markets</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>US margin debt minus S&amp;P 500 (% y/y) and S&amp;P 500 Index*</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-1772187518590355_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1156\" data-height=\"431\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-1772187518590355_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart 11: Excessive increases in margin debt have preceded equity bear markets\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"239\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-1772187518590355_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-1772187518590355_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-1772187518590355_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-1772187518590355_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">*Data from January 1997 to December 2025. <span>(Sources: Bloomberg, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), MRB, World Gold Council)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And after a long rally, and with valuations approaching dotcom levels, it would only take a couple of missed earnings targets to puncture confidence. This, in turn, could result in an unwinding of investor leverage positions (potentially magnifying the downside risks to stock prices) and lead to greater safe-haven demand, notably gold. In fact, with few exceptions, gold has been especially effective during such periods of systemic risk, generating positive returns and reducing overall portfolio losses (Chart 12).</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Chart 12: Gold provides downside protection</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>Stocks, bonds and gold performance during various crises*</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721875436994395_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1184\" data-height=\"436\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721875436994395_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart 12: Gold provides downside protection\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"236\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721875436994395_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721875436994395_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721875436994395_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/55028208-17721875436994395_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">*As of 31 December 2025.

In this environment, gold’s strategic role remains as relevant as ever. Its historical ability to provide diversification, mitigate drawdowns during periods of market stress, and perform even after strong run-ups reinforces its value as a core, long-term portfolio component. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.gold.org/goldhub/research/why-gold-2026-cross-asset-perspective#from-login=1\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

The current business is non-meaningful to Joby Aviation, as the company will ultimately replace the helicopters with new eVTOLs, expanding the service operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The real focus is on these key dynamics driving the company in 2026 and setting up a 2027 manufacturing ramp.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>First FAA-conforming aircraft for TIA set to fly shortly</strong>: All of the aircraft required for Type Inspection Authorization are also now in production</li> <li> <strong>First passengers expected in 2026</strong>: Joby expects to carry its first passengers in Dubai this year, as well as completing early operations in the U.S. as part of the White House-backed eVTOL Integration Pilot Program</li> <li> <strong>Plans to double production capacity in 2027</strong>: Joby signed an agreement to acquire a manufacturing facility in the Dayton, Ohio area, spanning more than 700,000 square feet, supporting plans to double production to four aircraft per month in 2027</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Joby Aviation should get the eVTOL aircraft certified by the FAA this year and fly passengers in Dubai. After that, the company can ramp up services as fast as responsible with current plans to build 4 aircraft per month. These aircraft generally have a retail value of $5 million for $20 million worth of aircraft produced per month, though the company plans to place these aircraft into service and generate revenues via passenger fares.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bad Capital Raise</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While all the news surrounding Joby Aviation is generally positive, with the company set to officially launch an air taxi service in 2026 and lead the market, the stock is now trading down towards the lows. Back in January, the company for some reason rushed out a secondary offering that crushed the stock, and it hasn't recovered yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company sold 60.8 million shares at $11.35 and issued $600 million in 9.75% convertible senior notes to <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4544022-joby-aviation-stock-slips-after-pricing-equity-convertible-debt-offerings\">raise $1.2 billion</a> when the stock was trading at $14.50 the prior week. Joby Aviation had just recently traded above $16 to start January and at highs of $20 back in 2025, so a big offering that far in the hole wasn't well received by the stock market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Joby Aviation went into the offering with a cash balance of $1.4 billion after completing another offering at <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4502512-joby-aviation-slides-after-pricing-514m-stock-offering\">$16.85 per share</a> for $514 million in 2025, so shareholders weren't expecting another big capital raise. The company would've appeared to have the capability to sell shares on successful FAA testing and certification this year, questioning the need to rush into a bad deal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company now has $2.6 billion in pro forma cash to start 2026. The stock has a fully diluted market cap in the $9.5 billion range, with a forecast for 2026 revenues topping $100 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874994-joby-aviation-inc-joby-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4'25 earnings call</a>, CFO Rodrigo Brumana confirmed the 2026 revenues are mostly related to Blade as follows:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>For 2026, we expect total revenue in the range of $105 million to $150 million with the <strong>vast majority generated by Blade</strong>. The Blade passenger business has operated seamlessly since closing with consistent service levels and customer demand. 2026 will remain a year of testing, learning and continued integration into Joby's broader commercial strategy.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The big question is where revenues can go in 2027 with aircraft production around 50 next year and operations launched in Dubai and quickly expanded in NYC. Joby Aviation is a future billion plus business with a simple ramp to far higher aircraft production rates in 2028 and beyond.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On FAA certification and air taxi service launch in Dubai, the stock is likely to rally back to the highs of $20. After that, the company will have to scale to the $1+ billion revenue range to warrant a higher price, but Anduril just raised funds at a <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/anduril-discusses-new-funding-60-billion-plus-valuation\" rel=\"nofollow\">$60 billion valuation</a> after hitting an <a href=\"https://www.aviationoutlook.com/p/anduril-company-analysis-outlook-report\" rel=\"nofollow\">estimated $2 billion in sales</a> in 2025. Anduril is an interesting intersection of autonomous defense and aircraft, offering a look into where the valuation of Joby Aviation could hit on a successful ramp of the business over the next few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest risk to the story is that lack of FAA certification. Joby Aviation is burning up to $370 million in cash just through the 1H of the year after spending $539 million last year. The company has plenty of cash now, but FAA certification delays in the months and quarters will add up to massive cash burn and loss of investor confidence.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key investor takeaway is that Joby Aviation has a monumental year ahead. The stock is now appealing after falling 50% from the highs due in part to the company raising substantial cash closer to the lows.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors can now buy the stock around $10 with less risk of another capital raise and Joby Aviation much closer to eVTOL certification and air taxi service launch.</p>",

The article was triggered by<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the large drop in its share prices and also the 10% credit card interest rate cap proposed by the Trump administration and rated the stock as a buy. Since then, the company has released its FQ4, 2025, earnings report (ER) in early Feb. As one of the most popular tickers in the payment space, the ER was quickly reviewed by several other analysts. As such, here I will just provide a very brief recap and then go on to focus on an aspect less mentioned: the latest changes in its treasury stock.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the company reported another quarter of challenged growth. As shown in the snapshot below, it missed consensus on both lines for FQ4. Topline growth kept accelerating to a rate of 3.7% YOY. Yet in the meantime, the company kept committing substantial resources to repurchase its own shares and build its treasury stock position. In FQ4, its treasury stock has grown to a record of $33.14 billion (for a company with a market capitalization of about $43 billion “only” at its current share prices). Against this backdrop, the central thesis of this follow-up article is that PayPal’s aggressive use of share repurchases has transitioned from a shareholder-friendly activity into a significant capital misallocation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174865715292_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1954\" data-height=\"309\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174865715292_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"101\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174865715292_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174865715292_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174865715292_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174865715292_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">PYPL stock treasury stock: historical perspective</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From past experiences, not many investors really pay attention to treasury stock. Thus, I feel a quick background is in good order. Treasury stock (aka treasury shares, TS) comes from share repurchases. After a company buys back its own shares, it can then either retire these shares or hold the stock for future use, which becomes the treasury shares in this latter case. Many companies buy back their shares, and many choose to not retire the shares bought (for good reasons to be elaborated on in a minute). What made PYPL stand out on my radar is the magnitude and consistency of its TS. As shown in the next chart, PYPL’s TS has been consistently growing in the past decade at rapid rates. As shown in the bottom panel, PayPal's TS grew another 22.3% in FQ4, 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174865883193_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1545\" data-height=\"1005\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174865883193_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"416\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174865883193_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174865883193_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174865883193_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174865883193_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">PYPL treasury stock: where it comes from</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As just mentioned, TS comes from the shares repurchased but not retired from shareholders. To this end, PYPL has been systematically purchasing its own shares—and again at large scales—in the long term. To wit, the next chart displays the resources PayPal has committed in the past on such repurchases. The top panel shows the absolute dollar amount, and the bottom panel shows the buyback yield (i.e., the size of the repurchases relative to its market cap). As seen, on average, PYPL committed about $798 million <em>per quarter</em> during the past 10 years on these repurchases, which in turn translated into a net common buyback yield of 3.55% on average. The latest buyback in FQ4 is almost 2x higher than the average (about $1.45 billion), and the buyback yield is 13.62%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PYPL only started a dividend in late 2025 (at $0.14 per share and a FWD yield of around 1.1% as of this writing). If the funds it spent on repurchase were paid out as dividends, it would make PYPL one of the most mouth-watering dividend stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-177211748660106_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1560\" data-height=\"1011\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-177211748660106_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"415\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-177211748660106_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-177211748660106_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-177211748660106_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-177211748660106_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">PYPL treasury stock: hidden treasury or capital misallocation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, let me get back to a point I mentioned earlier about TS being a sign of shareholder friendliness. Indeed, a large TS position can be a strong sign of a company’s cash flow capability and the share’s attractive valuation ratios. Both of these points can be valid under PYPL’s current conditions. Moreover, when compared to retiring the shares bought back, keeping them in a TS position also offers some potential advantages. The potential advantages can come in various ways, but the common theme in my mind is flexibility. A TS position, especially a sizable one, gives a company flexibility to use these shares opportunistically later.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, under PYPL’s current conditions, my assessment is that continued capital allocation into TS at these levels constitutes a capital misallocation. Fundamentally, it ignores the diminishing returns of financial engineering in a low-growth environment. Judging by PayPal’s 2026 guidance announced in FQ4, I see large odds for a flat EPS or even a mild decline. I see little odds for the buyback and the continued TS buildup to offset such decline; in turn, I see little odds for the share prices to be supported by the buybacks and/or TS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you subscribe to the above notion, then some alternative capital allocation approaches would make immediate sense. To start, to echo a point I made earlier, increasing the cash dividend payouts would return the capital to shareholders so that they can decide what to do themselves. Paying down its debt is a no-brainer in my view also. As seen in the next two charts, PYPL’s total liabilities have remained largely unchanged in recent years (actually increasing slightly from about $55 billion to FQ4’s $60 billion, as shown in the first chart). Furthermore, the borrowing rates on some of its bonds are not low (5%+ as shown in the second chart).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-1772117486525288_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2122\" data-height=\"539\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-1772117486525288_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"163\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-1772117486525288_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-1772117486525288_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-1772117486525288_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-1772117486525288_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174905607443_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2370\" data-height=\"402\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174905607443_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"109\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174905607443_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174905607443_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174905607443_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174905607443_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>TradingView</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other risks and final thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking into the long term, I think the approach to deal with the challenges is for PayPal to redirect its capital toward aggressive R&amp;D and strategic M&amp;A to bolster its omnichannel presence. The company’s R&amp;D efforts have been in decline in recent years while the industry is evolving rapidly. To wit, the next chart tracks the Research and Development (R&amp;D) to revenue ratio as of TTM for PayPal and Block (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XYZ\" title=\"Block, Inc.\">XYZ</a>), its closest and most direct competitor in my view. The data spans the last 5 years, from 2017 through FQ4. As seen, PayPal’s R&amp;D intensity has been around 12% of its revenues in 2020~2022. But it has steadily decayed since then to the current level of 9.31%, compared to about 12.38% for Block. And I do see plenty of areas where the company can further its R&amp;D efforts and/or identify acquisition targets. The top areas on my list include AI-driven biometric checkout and rolling out additional Venmo monetization mechanisms/patterns. This approach should yield a higher internal rate of return in the long term than buying back shares of the business in its current state.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174866504555_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1307\" data-height=\"500\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174866504555_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"245\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174866504555_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174866504555_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174866504555_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174866504555_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of valuation, as aforementioned, the stock is trading at very attractive multiples, either by absolute or relative standards. As shown in the next table, its FWD P/E ratio is in the single digits now (8.87x only) based on the updated 2026 EPS revisions. Again, this points to an almost flat bottom line (with a 0.47% YOY change). EPS recovery is expected to start in FY 2027 with a 4-year CAGR of around 9.5%. Hence, when adjusted for growth projection, PYPL’s PEG (P/E growth) ratio is below 1x, quite GARP-friendly (growth at a reasonable price).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To close, this PYPL revisit was triggered by the updates the company provided in its FQ4 ER with a particular focus on the growth risks and also the record treasury stock buildup. These developments have led me to question its capital allocation. My assessment is that the TS buildup, if continued, represents a capital misallocation that takes resources away from strengthening its underlying operations. These considerations have led me to downgrade my rating to hold.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174865340905_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1585\" data-height=\"392\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174865340905_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"158\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174865340905_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174865340905_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174865340905_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/48844541-17721174865340905_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p>",

For the calendar year, the Fund’s Institutional Class returned +3.17% compared to +17.21% for the index.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A High-Level Portfolio View</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We discuss in greater detail the “puts and takes” to our performance for both the quarter and calendar year below, but the punchline is straightforward: our results didn’t measure up in 2025. On the positive side of the ledger, we owned several companies that investors currently deem “AI Winners”, namely Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>), Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) and Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), that averaged roughly 16% of Fund assets in 2025. Nearly 40% of our holdings represent our view of other long-term, durably growing businesses. These companies range from payment networks (Visa (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/V\" title=\"Visa Inc.\">V</a>), Mastercard (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MA\" title=\"Mastercard Incorporated\">MA</a>)) to insurance-related holdings (Berkshire Hathaway (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.A</a>)(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.B</a>), Aon Corp) and collectively posted returns in excess of 10% in 2025, short of the benchmark return but in most other ways, a respectable year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, our portfolio of life sciences investments (roughly 18% of average assets) experienced a “lost year”. In a different year, we would include these in the high-quality, durable business category. Instead, 2025 began with pressure on research budgets and heightened scrutiny of our national health care apparatus. The industry is reorienting around a “new normal” and a pickup of organic growth in key areas has spurred a rally, ultimately equating to a neutral contribution this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite hailing from different industries, our top detractors generally have one thing in common: statistically cheap valuations. Averaging roughly 16% of portfolio assets in 2025, what others might call our “deep value” stocks had a disproportionately negative impact on returns. As value-oriented investors, we are comfortable taking contrarian positions, understanding that patience is required for others to see what we do. But we must also be clear-eyed about how our companies’ prospects change and adapt accordingly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, CarMax (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KMX\" title=\"CarMax, Inc.\">KMX</a>) faces a challenging operating environment. Availability and affordability of late model used vehicles (CarMax’s strongest category) remain constrained, while online competitor Carvana has taken share. At the same time, CarMax’s own investments in its omni-channel capabilities have yet to deliver improvements, prompting strategic changes and the CEO’s ousting. While we continue to respect CarMax’s brand and scale advantages, the near-term path to improved fundamentals became less visible, leading us to step aside and monitor developments from the sidelines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Liberty Broadband’s operating entity, Charter Communications (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CHTR\" title=\"Charter Communications, Inc.\">CHTR</a>), has faced negative headlines, too, but there are important differences. Importantly, connectivity at home and on the go has become a non-discretionary expense for most households, underpinning the durability of Charter’s cash flows in a way that selling used cars does not. Charter’s mobile service continues to win in the market, creating a converged bundled product that competes well for the limited number of customers available. And while Charter still has work to do on its network upgrade program, 2025 is expected to mark the peak year of spending. As this investment moderates, free cash flow should improve, supporting continued share repurchases at today’s depressed prices. With the benefit of hindsight, the early phase of this investment cycle was painful, but we believe the setup is improving and chose to maintain our position.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notable 4Q and 2025 Contributors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Google parent Alphabet was the Fund’s top performer in both periods. The latest release of the Gemini AI surpassed expectations, with several benchmarks showing Gemini’s performance moved to the front of the pack. A pickup in growth among Danaher and Thermo Fisher helped spur a recovery in their shares. Thermo’s fourth quarter rally also pushed its shares onto the annual contributor list. IDEX and Amazon round out the quarter’s top performers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perimeter Solutions (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PRM\" title=\"Perimeter Solutions, Inc.\">PRM</a>) capped a strong 2025 by signing a new, extended contract for its firefighting solutions and services with the U.S. Forest Service. Berkshire Hathaway was another top 2025 contributor, reflecting both its “port in the storm” characteristics during periods of heightened volatility and another year of solid operating performance. As legendary CEO Warren Buffett steps aside and Greg Abel assumes the CEO role, we remain confident that Berkshire’s reputation and prospects are firmly intact. Shares of Microsoft and Thermo round out the top 5 annual contributors.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notable 4Q and 2025 Detractors</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Liberty Broadband (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LBRDK\" title=\"Liberty Broadband Corporation\">LBRDK</a>) is a standout detractor in both periods. As discussed above in more detail, we look forward to an improved cash flow posture in 2026. SiriusXM shares stalled as we await a more robust auto market and the end of the current satellite investment cycle. Euronet Worldwide completed its acquisition of Corecard, while Microsoft and Roper round out the top quarterly detractors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As detailed above, CarMax was the Fund’s top full-year detractor and was sold. Shares of Global Payments have yet to recover from the aggressive sell-off after announcing their intention to acquire Worldpay. The deal closed in early 2026, and we look forward to more operating details from the company and the planned reduction in debt. Finally, despite positive returns in the fourth quarter, IDEX and Bio-Techne round out the full-year detractors list.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top Contributors and Detractors</h2> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr><td colspan=\"5\"><p>TOP CONTRIBUTORS (%)</p></td></tr> <tr> <td> </td> <td><p>Return</p></td> <td><p>Average Weight</p></td> <td><p>Contribution</p></td> <td><p>% of Net Assets</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Alphabet, Inc.</p></td> <td><p>28.94</p></td> <td><p>6.15</p></td> <td><p>1.63</p></td> <td><p>6.2</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.

We also exited our small position in GCI Liberty (received via spin-off from Liberty Broadband) at a small profit. We received shares of Euronet in its acquisition of Corecard but otherwise did not add any new companies to the portfolio. Trims of Alphabet, Danaher, Thermo Fisher, Microsoft and Global Payments (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GPN\" title=\"Global Payments Inc.\">GPN</a>) were partially offset by additions to Aon and Roper Technologies. The Fund did not maintain any short positions during the fourth quarter, exiting the year with a net long position of 93% of Fund assets.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p>All data is as of 12/31/2025 unless otherwise indicated.</p> <p>The opinions expressed are those of Weitz Investment Management and are not meant as investment advice or to predict or project the future performance of any investment product.

As for guidance, we can expect 1Q26 revenue to fall between $185 and $200 million. This was also above the consensus estimate of $180.9 million. Management also projected GAAP gross margins of 34% to 36%, but a narrower adjusted EBITDA loss of $21 to $27 million, which would imply much improved operating leverage with revenue bumping up. As for the investor sentiment, a lot of this stock's upside is seen to be dependent on the Neutron. So in that sense, we got two bits of new news that won't be taken too well by the market. First, the Neutron is getting pushed back until 4Q26, and secondly, there is the whole narrative around this tank rupture, which I will try to explain a bit later on.

We saw some rapid top-line growth, an expanding backlog, and also strengthening operational scale. They’re even still continuing to invest quite heavily in future programs. FY25 revenue hit $602 million, up about 38% year-over-year from $436 million in 2024. Strong momentum across both product and service segments. Product revenue rose to $371.6 million, almost 28%, and was mainly driven by spacecraft/satellite components, whilst service revenue surged to $230.2 million, about 57%. We’re seeing increased demand for launch services and mission operations. As for 4Q25, it saw $180 million in revenue, a new company record, and also represented about 36% growth compared to the same time last year. This kind of revenue acceleration means Rocket Lab is no longer just a niche small-launch provider. The key driver here, and has been for a long time, their diversification across space systems, with defence contracts and science missions ramping up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721761699577038_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1198\" data-height=\"614\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721761699577038_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"328\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721761699577038_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721761699577038_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721761699577038_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721761699577038_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Rocket Lab Corporation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability metrics are also showing meaningful structural improvement, but we are still seeing net losses. Gross profit for 2025 almost doubled to $207.2 million, compared to $116.1 million in 2024. As for gross margin, it expanded as manufacturing volume and operational efficiency improved. Non-GAAP gross margin hit 39.7%, up from 32.0% a year ago, with overall better cost absorption and improving unit economics, and that's in both launch and spacecraft production. However, what investors wouldn't have been too pleased with were the operating expenses, which rose to a hefty $436 million. Now, this was mainly due to a 55% increase in R&amp;D spending, up to $270.7 million, which I think is just the aggressive investment in Neutron we should have expected. Selling, general, and administrative costs also increased, now up to $165.3 million, but are pretty consistent with scaling operations and integrating acquisitions. So as a result, the company reported an FY25 operating loss of about $228.8 million, only slightly worse than 2024’s $189.8 million loss despite us now seeing much higher revenue. It’s definitely improving operating leverage even with the spending staying elevated.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721762197964258_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1193\" data-height=\"642\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721762197964258_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"344\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721762197964258_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721762197964258_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721762197964258_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721762197964258_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Rocket Lab Corporation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, below the operating line, Rocket Lab benefited from much stronger interest income and also some balance-sheet optimisation. Net interest income contributed nicely in 2025, with cash balances increasing substantially. This helped offset interest expense from prior debt issuance. But the company still recorded a net loss of $198.2 million, or about $0.37 per share. A figure only slightly higher than the prior year’s loss despite revenue rising by more than $165 million. Adjusted EBITDA also came in at a loss of $101.2 million compared to $96.9 million in 2024. Importantly, here it's the gap between revenue growth and loss growth that we want to see narrowed. That's where we will get future revenue increments, converting more efficiently into profit once some major development programs mature.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Total assets nearly doubled to $2.32 billion. We can put this down to higher cash balances, acquisitions, and also increased property, plant, and equipment. Cash and cash equivalents alone are now up to $828.7 million, compared with just $271 million a year earlier. We would expect this sum to increase since Rocket Lab needs significant liquidity to fund Neutron development and some other large defence contracts in place. Goodwill and intangible assets also expanded quite a bit due to some acquisitions like Optical Support Inc. and Precision Components Limited. Total liabilities are now down to about $602.6 million from $801.9 million, but I think we can put this down to convertible debt balances being reduced, whilst stockholders’ equity actually surged to $1.72 billion, up from just $382 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for cash flow dynamics, we’re seeing some change in Rocket Lab, with operating activities using $165.5 million in cash in 2025, compared with just $48.9 million in 2024. It could be a reflection of higher working capital needs, especially inventory, but also of the heavier R&amp;D spend. Investing activities consumed roughly $347.4 million; for the most part, this was for capital expenditures and acquisitions to support manufacturing capacity and advanced tech development. The outflows were also offset by $1.07 billion in financing inflows, which mainly came from some big equity offerings in 2025. These drove the year-end cash balance sharply higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strategically speaking, one of the big areas we wanted growth in was the backlog. This expanded to $1.85 billion, up 73% year-over-year. This backlog is now anchored mainly by long-duration defence/government contracts. Keep in mind this also includes the $816 million Space Development Agency award, which investors are hoping will provide some higher revenue visibility into future years. Combine this 1Q26 revenue guidance of $185 to 200 million, which gives us about 57% year-on-year growth at the midpoint, the results would suggest Rocket Lab is entering a phase of accelerated scaling. We’re seeing revenue growth outpacing cost growth, and gross margins improving nicely. So in short, although they remain unprofitable, 2025 showed us a business moving from a development-heavy launch provider into a very diversified space systems prime contractor with much stronger margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721761948255246_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1194\" data-height=\"640\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721761948255246_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"343\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721761948255246_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721761948255246_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721761948255246_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721761948255246_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Rocket Lab Corporation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Neutron delay is seen as an area of concern</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the biggest concerns investors probably have is that it just seems like the Neutron timeline keeps getting pushed back with every earnings call. The first launch is pushed to 4Q26, which some may view as management telling us to, in reality, expect 1Q27 or later, since most have lost confidence in management's timeline expectations. But keep in mind that it can be very difficult for space programs to hit their first launch date after a major hardware failure. And a tank rupture isn’t good by any means.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also on the call, there was a question about whether the Neutron would have been ready without the tank failure, to which management didn’t seem to give the most definitive answer. The result is a delay, and whilst I don't think it matters a lot for the trajectory of the company, it matters a lot for the stock. You see, if Neutron slips too far, investors may think it’s not going to come during their investment window. Many have bought into this stock purely on the anticipation that the Neutron would offer a boost, especially after shares fell back in the high $60 range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are also some massive opportunities for Rocket Lab, should they have an operating Neutron rocket. Some of these would include the Golden Dome launch needs. The Neutron is supposed to be Rocket Lab’s ticket into a new tier of missions. I also mentioned in my previous <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4832436-rocket-lab-why-the-neutron-could-see-more-demand-than-you-think\">coverage</a> the completely new TAM that would be unlocked should they have a higher-capacity rocket in the lineup.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tank rupture</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So a bit talking point was this tank rupture. I feel it’s quite early days to be writing off the launch or the stock based on this failure, but what made it worse was probably the lack of clarity. We will probably find out more later, but for now, I'm going to try to explain what we know. The failure happened on a first-stage Neutron propellant tank for the Neutron rocket during structural pressure testing. Now, keep in mind that this isn’t some random test article; this is actually one of the primary load-bearing tanks that holds cryogenic propellant.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So its job here is to basically carry the thrust loads from the engines and the mass of the upper stage. You see, a rocket's first stage has two main tanks, the fuel and the oxidiser. So each one has to survive both flight loads and also extra margin testing on the ground. Peter Beck told us on the call that the tank actually met its expected flight loads, but failed when they intentionally pushed it beyond that. So they’re trying to map out structural margins of the tank. So we can take it that it wasn't a design-level collapse under nominal conditions, but rather it failed when they were stress-testing the boundaries. If failures were to happen, I would want them to happen at this stage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721767271946568_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1234\" data-height=\"661\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721767271946568_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"343\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721767271946568_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721767271946568_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721767271946568_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/63097563-17721767271946568_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Rocket Lab Corporation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key detail we wanted to know is why. The rupture seems to be traced back to a manufacturing defect at a critical joint, which I think is the tank closeout area. As far as I know, in a rocket's tank, that's the transition between the composite barrel and the dome section. Also, they told us that the joint was made by a third-party contractor using a hand-laid process and not Rocket Lab’s automated fibre placement (AFP) machine. They also used that contractor to move faster whilst the AFP line was being commissioned in parallel, so that makes sense on paper, but as a result, it’s clearly introduced risk. So the defect weakened that joint locally, and when they expanded the test envelope, it became the failure point. Importantly here, Rocket Lab said the rest of the tank behaved as expected, which would support their claim that this was just a process defect, and not an actual structural design flaw. The next tank is tipped to be already in production, and this time it’s being built fully in-house on the AFP machine.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So that said, this isn’t a trivial setback. Even if the new tank build is quick, it still has to go through the full qualification testing cycle. So that means pressure cycles, structural loads, and verification. And because this was a first-stage tank, it’s not just some minor subsystem; it’s the foundational hardware that gave investors so much concern. So if it fails again, the schedule resets again. But now we know it wasn’t a bad design and wasn’t random, and it still confirms that Neutron is deep in first-article manufacturing risk territory. So what I’m trying to say here is that whilst this was exactly the kind of failure you expect in a new rocket program, it also reinforces why 4Q26 feels a bit too optimistic.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RKLB/valuation/metrics\">valuation</a>, Rocket Lab is essentially priced for near-flawless long-term execution rather than near-term fundamentals. However, we’ve known that for quite some time. The market cap sits around $37.5 billion, and the trailing twelve-month revenue is just over $600 million. The stock trades at a hefty 65x sales, compared to a sector median closer to 2x sales. It essentially makes Rocket Lab one of the most expensive industrial and aerospace stocks in the public market on a revenue multiple basis. Even if we take a forward view, the multiple barely improves, with a ratio just above 60x forward sales. So that tells me investors are discounting a lot of years of rapid growth and eventually some dominance in medium-lift launch and space systems. On balance sheet metrics, the stock trades at about 27x book value, versus a sector median of 3x. So it’s clear again that a lot of future success is already embedded in the share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problem I see with this setup is that earnings-based valuation metrics are effectively unusable, there is no meaningful price-to-earnings ratio today, and even out-year estimates imply pretty extreme multiples. So it means that the equity story is resting almost entirely on revenue growth and strategic positioning here, not profitability. For me, that makes the stock very sensitive to execution risk, especially with investors betting so much on the Neutron’s schedule and cadence. If we see the Neutron ramp smoothly from here and also space systems' margins continuing to expand, then the valuation can eventually be justified. But if Neutron slips more materially in 2026, there is very little margin of safety in the current price. Rocket Lab is basically being valued like a future aerospace prime contractor today, even though it still looks financially more like a high-burn growth company.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, here the story is going to be defined by two things: execution in space systems and credibility on Neutron. So in the near term, revenue growth should continue to be driven mainly by spacecraft manufacturing, defence contracts, and mission services. The good thing is that demand here already looks structurally strong. So I'm expecting the slow ramp-up in revenue here with the stock reacting positively to new contract wins in 2026. This is what gives the company a real business today, not just a future launch vehicle narrative.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, we have to be realistic that the stock is still trading almost entirely on long-term expectations, which means slips in the Neutron schedule or ambiguity around hardware readiness will likely keep overshadowing revenue success. If Rocket Lab can show steady margin expansion in space systems and tangible, de-risking milestones for the Neutron throughout 2026, then I see more upside ahead at current levels. Also, that valuation can start to make more sense.</p>",

In this article, I'll be going through those reasons, I'll be providing an industry-wide overview of what the company might achieve going forward, and I'll be telling you what to look out for in terms of potential downsides and when the company might \"go south\" again. To call this company in Medtech \"safe\" or as good as some of the other ones I invest in from a fundamental perspective would be incorrect. The company is smaller, has higher debt, and doesn't have as big or as impressive a market share as other companies that I cover. This is also why my position in the business has been relatively limited so far.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's rise means that we're now trading above a fair-value multiple of 15x, where our thesis is no longer based solely on valuation reversal (which I consider a key part of my approach), but more on <em>consistent earnings growth on a forward basis. </em>The fact that the company does not offer any sort of yield adds to this, as does the fact that LivaNova is at its heart a very volatile business in terms of both share price and earnings, which cannot be said in the same way for some of its competition. This means that we need to be careful with LivaNova, and consider how, if, and when to exit this investment. The biggest question for me here will be whether to lower the company to a \"HOLD\" rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I raised my PT for the company to $61/share in my last article. This means, based on the current trading price of almost $71/share, that another \"BUY\" would mean that the company's share price would have to be raised considerably for this to still be the case.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's see why I do not believe raising it from here to well above $71/share would be a good idea.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">LivaNova PLC - Upside from valuation, but future upside is more uncertain</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">LivaNova has been a very good investment. Since my first \"BUY\" article that coincided with me adding a small position, the company is up over 54% relative to the SPY's 11%, making it much, much more than a statistical aberration and a proven \"good choice\" in terms of valuation and return. It's also proof that you shouldn't ignore smaller players, and that focusing on valuation for companies, as long as the fundamentals for the companies are of a solid nature.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">LivaNova, as far as medical devices and medtech go, is relatively simple as a company. It focuses on heart-lung and nervous system solutions, specifically with <em>devices</em> and specifically for surgery, and for assistance, such as oxygenators, valves, machines, and therapy systems. Any company with any sort of market share in something like life support (during surgical procedures) is a company that is worth your attention. Furthermore, the company's work with technologies and solutions for things like sleep apnea is, in my view, likely to potentially provide growth as well. The company's size is not as big as some giants like Siemens Healthineers (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SEMHF\" title=\"Siemens Healthineers AG\">SEMHF</a>), but also not small, with a solid market cap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason for recent outperformance, meaning since about early to mid-2025, is the <em>significant sales growth reported by the company. </em>Not just the top line either - LivaNova has managed to exceed forecasts and estimates, even my own. Improved reimbursement trends have been part of it, but LivaNova's 4Q25 saw the company reaching its fifth consecutive annual report of double-digit EPS growth, with a near-double-digit EPS on top-line sales as well. This is a very strong executor that seems to have everything going for it. The company's US operations have improved through significant Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement trends, which are expected to generate further earnings growth in 2026 as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you couple this with further growth in high-margin OSA segments, there's a good reason for expecting LivaNova to continue to at least deliver earnings growth. Many analysts have increased their targets and prices as of 4Q25, and as of the latest results, which came in yesterday (February 25th), I'm on board with raising the target as well. When a company outperforms like this, some sort of adjustment is in order. My own estimate was at 6% revenue growth, and closer to 7-8% EPS growth, but I was wrong here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49836612-17720942196438577_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1907\" data-height=\"1066\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49836612-17720942196438577_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"LivaNova PLC Investor Presentation 4Q25 Results\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49836612-17720942196438577_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49836612-17720942196438577_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49836612-17720942196438577_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49836612-17720942196438577_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>LivaNova PLC Investor Presentation 4Q25 Results</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lower FCF does not bug me here - it's a matter of WC and CapEx. SG&amp;A declines are more important, and an increased amount of R&amp;D is never a bad thing for a company in this field (in my view). I'd focus on improved EBIT margin, lower SG&amp;A, and solid EPS coupled with quarterly revenue growth. These are all solid signals, directly correlated and connected to the most important company trends - and these trends look even better from a 2025A perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49836612-17720943084068377_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1885\" data-height=\"1049\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49836612-17720943084068377_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"LivaNova PLC Investor Presentation 4Q25 Results\" width=\"640\" height=\"356\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49836612-17720943084068377_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49836612-17720943084068377_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49836612-17720943084068377_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49836612-17720943084068377_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>LivaNova PLC Investor Presentation 4Q25 Results</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's legacy sectors in Cardiopulmonary, or CP, continue to dominate the sales, but Neuromodulation sales, the segment that I believe could drive further growth, are going up further here. We/you want the company to grow this segment, because the segment is at substantially better margins than Cardio - we're talking a difference of over 100%, with 35.4% in Neuromodulation and less than 16% in CP. The company has delivered full-year guidance for 2026, and the guidance is good, if somewhat slower than before.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2026E is the first year in a while where the company is now expecting mid-to-high single-digit growth in both revenue and EPS growth. Thus, it's fair to say that even the company is expecting the EPS growth to taper off a bit, including an FCF that's set to stay at, or below, the 2025A level. This should at the very least temper our expectations a bit, which is why I consider PT raises to above $80/share for the company as a result of this year's earnings to be perhaps a bit too positive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe bulls may be a bit too positive on the company's prospects here, and not focused enough on the risks inherent to the company. CP company products come with manageable and limited risk, despite some risks for infection for some of the company's devices (but this is for all such devices). However, going into the modulation of nerves, with things like VNS therapy for epilepsy and depression, opens the company up to risks for such devices. There are competition risks as well - LivaNova is far from the only company doing neuromodulation. NeuroPace and even new entrants are coming to market, and also Medtronic (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDT\" title=\"Medtronic plc\">MDT</a>) is in this segment, with much larger \"financial muscles\". While the company's products are good, they lack an immediate market uniqueness, such as you'd find in Carl Zeiss Meditec (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CZMWY\" title=\"Carl Zeiss Meditec AG\">CZMWY</a>), with a different type of \"market dominance\".</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The risks from the $350M+ settlement are gone. From that perspective, I believe a 4-6% revenue and EPS growth should be entirely possible. The question is, is that enough for this company to continue to be valued at higher multiples?</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation for LivaNova in 2026 - I'm upgrading my PT, but only to $68/share.</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, let me clarify what I'm seeing here. LivaNova is likely to grow, but it's unlikely to grow as quickly as before. Remember, the company \"crashed\" back in 2019-2020 due to significant revenue decline, declining sales in legacy, and abandonment of a key program it was driving for. We know, therefore, that EPS volatility is very much part of this company's M.O. To expect this company to drive on and on for the next few years is possible, but it would be bullish.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company also has a rather unfortunate tendency to trade at excesses at times - without really any earnings-related reasons to do so. Look at the trends in share price relative to earnings for these two times below - there's very little logic here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49836612-17721136849489827_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1405\" data-height=\"883\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49836612-17721136849489827_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"F.A.S.T graphs LivaNova PLC Valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"402\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49836612-17721136849489827_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49836612-17721136849489827_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49836612-17721136849489827_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/49836612-17721136849489827_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>F.A.S.T Graphs<span> LivaNova PLC Valuation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also know this company can significantly fail to hit growth targets. That was also part of the reason for the development. You can see that if you invested close to the peak, thanks to the zero dividend, there's a high likelihood of you being in the negative here. Valuation, as I keep jamming on, matters. It matters a lot.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because I bought when the company was cheap, I'm up over 48%. The question now is what we expect from here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For me, I say the 9-10% EPS estimates are too bullish. I cut those to 5-6%, citing the company's own expectations for the next year (\"mid-range single digit\"). While the company could see an upside from things like neuromodulation growth, there's a lot of competition and a lot of uncertainty here. Take, for instance, reimbursement rates from Medicare/Medicaid. What would happen if these were to drop again? It would, for sure, lead to lower adoption from hospitals, lower top-line growth, and the like. For the time being, the trend (in 2026), is <em>positive</em>, but I am saying that this can change. I'm citing US federal budget cuts, inflation, <a href=\"https://www.medicarerights.org/medicare-watch/2025/10/02/states-already-cutting-medicaid-massive-federal-cuts-yet-to-come#:~:text=The%20budget%20reconciliation%20bill%2C%20HR,downturns%20without%20cutting%20major%20programs.\" rel=\"nofollow\">and payment models that some say aren't working.</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So any company, like LivaNova, that depends on this, is potentially in danger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of valuation, I now believe the company should, at most, trade at 20x P/E. This expectation represents <em>slower growth than the market expectation. </em>I'm cutting the average 10%+ growth from legacy and neuromodulation to 5-7%, which I believe will cause a bit of a premium compression to 19-20x P/E. I also forecast that the company's high-growth ambitions in OSA and DTD (the new segments) will not show the results the company expects. Recent trends confirm this, <a href=\"https://sleep-doctor.com/blog/imthera-livanova-aura6000-thn3-randomized-trial-outcomes/\" rel=\"nofollow\">with clinical trials being so-so, not even good enough for FDA approval.</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I further forecast slower earnings growth from margin compression and more R&amp;D costs, especially following the clinical trial pressures. Based on this, I work with a 19-20x P/E on 5-8% growth, coming to a fair value of about $87/share, and a PT for at most $68/share due to the lack of a yield. The current upside to 19x only shows 9-10% annualized growth with my estimates, and that is not good enough for me.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks are now as follows.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks &amp; Considerations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The risk seen by most people, the litigation, is already included and, as of 4Q25, gone. The $360M was included for the full year, and much as I expected, did not derail the company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bigger risks I see are the slowing growth rates of the neuromodulation segment, which the company, as of 4Q25, is confirming for the forecast of 2026, and the potential, or lack of it, that the new treatment areas/new technology are introducing here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A lack of realized growth in these areas could, and would, result in lower EPS growth, which could normalize the premium, and this is what I believe is likely to happen going forward. I'm allowing a slightly higher FV and PT due to outperformance, but the chance of further upside is, in my view, limited.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">LivaNova is a solid company in key diagnostic and treatment segments. The company has decent fundamentals, excellent market-leading positions, and is posting growth, with the disadvantages of a lack of dividends and some growth uncertainties going forward. Otherwise, risks are limited to high-level environmental litigation, which I believe the market is overestimating, and historical volatility in earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I discount for the volatility in earnings by lowering the company, and using a conservative forecast. My fair value target is over 25% discounted at $87/share in terms of the 20-year average, and a PT of $68/share, upgraded for 4Q25 going into 2026. I am therefore lowering my rating for the company to a \"HOLD\".</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here are my criteria and how the company fulfills them.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><em>This company is overall qualitative.</em></li> <li><em>This company is fundamentally safe/conservative &amp; well-run.</em></li> <li>This company pays a well-covered dividend.</li> <li>This company is currently cheap.</li> <li>This company has a realistic upside that is high enough, based on earnings growth or multiple expansion/reversion.</li> </ul> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company fulfills 2 out of 3 quality indicators, and 0 out of 2 valuation indicators. That means 3/5 \"stars\" here, which typically isn't enough. Based on this, and a valuation target of $68/share, I see a risk/reward-adjusted upside that's attractive enough for me. I give the company a \"Hold\" rating as of February 2026.</p>",
