A lack of execution and past disappointments make it difficult to build conviction, although the company still has time to (partially) recover from this.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some Perspective</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aspen Aerogels started its corporate history as a provider of industrial insulation activities, this being a $100 million but lossmaking business when the company went public a little over a decade ago. Understanding what happened to the business is key, as multiple boom-bust cycles and strategic pivots explain why the company finds itself where it sits today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the company failed to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability, the company decided to reposition its business to provide solutions for EV batteries. This made it so that a share price of just a dollar ended up rising to a high of $60 in 2021, followed by a pullback to the low single digits in 2023. This was followed by a recovery to the $30 mark in 2024, with shares now back down again at just about $3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These developments came as the company saw strong growth coming out of the pandemic. Revenues rose nearly 50% to $180 million in 2022 as growth slowed to 30% in 2023, yet growth accelerated to triple digits in 2024, which made the production capacity limits of $650 million come within sight.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To facilitate further and continued growth, the company was looking to build a huge new plant, at a nearly $2 billion bill, aided by the help of the DOE and external financiers. All this was driven by a strong 2024, with revenues reported up 90% to $453 million, accompanied by an operating profit of $53 million.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Big Implosion</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the company guided for first quarter sales for 2025 to come in below the hundred million mark, the bigger news was that the company halted construction of its new and giant plant. Revenues quickly fell to a run rate of $300 million, with no realistic operating profits seen anymore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this stands in sharp contrast to the growth reported in the years before, attributed to oversupply of its solutions to EV manufacturers. Worse, with developments continuing in solid-state batteries, the company could be facing a long-term threat, as such batteries could result in much less demand for its products in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conditions remained brutal as third quarter sales of $73 million were still somewhat reasonable at a near $300 million run rate, yet the company guided for fourth-quarter sales to fall to just $45 million, to be accompanied by EBITDA losses of $10 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company claimed that it could reduce EBITDA break-even levels to $200 million while maintaining a gross cash position of at least $100 million, as a new European contract might even bring in $150 million in revenues as soon as 2027.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">More Disappointments</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By the end of February, Aspen <a href=\"https://ir.aerogel.com/news/news-details/2026/Aspen-Aerogels-Inc--Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Financial-Results-and-Recent-Business-Highlights/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.aerogel.com/news/news-details/2026/Aspen-Aerogels-Inc--Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Financial-Results-and-Recent-Business-Highlights/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">delivered</a> disastrous results at the end of the year. Fourth quarter sales imploded to $41 million. Thermal barrier revenues, those being EV insulation revenues, fell to just $16 million, as lower demand no longer provided a valid excuse to call out capacity constraints for the energy industrial business. Revenues of that segment were cut more than in half to $25 million as well. All this weighed heavily on the P&amp;L statement, with gross profits even reported at negative $23 million and GAAP operating losses reported at $70 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Worse, first quarter sales are seen down further to $35-$40 million, with adjusted EBITDA losses seen between minus $10 and $13 million; this actually marks a modest improvement from a negative $18 million number in the fourth quarter as the company works to lower costs. The company actually maintained a net cash position of just more than $50 million here, depending on the exact definition of net debt, as 82 million shares traded around the $3 mark, for a near quarter of a billion equity valuation here.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Now?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's clear is that expectations are very low, with Aspen's operating assets valued at just around $200 million. Moreover, while near-term losses will continue, some cash inflows are expected as well. In March, the company expects to obtain a $38 million cash payment fro<span class=\"highlighted_text\">m GM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GM\" title=\"General Motors Company\">GM</a>)</span> relating to a commercial settlement relating to EV capacity adjustments. Moreover, a non-binding LOI for the sale of the Georgia facility has been signed (at an unknown price) as the European customer announced in the fourth quarter was identified to be Volvo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even more extreme, reviews are seen for the commercial growth plans and the capital structure as the company continues to reduce the break-even point of the business. EBITDA breakeven levels for 2025 were seen at $270 million; this number is seen coming down to $200 million in 2026 and even a bit further into 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, sequential revenue growth is seen in 2026, albeit that the bar is low, driven by recovery of GM volumes, greater subsea industrial orders, as well as recovery of the EV market at large.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In between sufficient liquidity, Aspen is not in real financial stress (yet) and certainly has a chance to improve its fortunes, but that requires great efforts, yet fortunately from a position of a net cash position. A combination of continued cost cuts and sequential revenue growth could be helping here, although much progress is needed.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this remains highly speculative after investors in Aspen have been burned many times in recent times. While there appears to be a base underneath the business, and the company has some potential triggers, the reality is that the risk-reward might be reasonable, although this is a hugely speculative stance. We have higher conviction ideas at <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/486-value-in-corporate-events/articles\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/486-value-in-corporate-events/articles\" target=\"_blank\">Value in Corporate Events</a>, but will continue to monitor what happens next at the company.</p>",

The problem is that the market is unsure when<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> NVDA’s revenue growth will peak and the increased amount of capital being deployed toward CapEx initiatives by the hyperscalers will disappear. This quarter should have alleviated the fears around the AI buildout, but we are seeing the market punish shares of NVDA as they have become a victim of their own success. Shares of </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557606-nvidia-stands-alone-upbeat-outlook-sends-stock-higher-leaving-mag-7-in-the-red\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA sold off</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> by more than -5% today and long-term investors are getting one of the cheapest valuations we have seen recently.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that the downward pressure on shares of NVDA are a gift for long-term investors as we have all the data needed to understand that the AI infrastructure buildout still has a long way to go. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>) plans on spending between $52 - $56 billion on <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tsmc-lifts-2026-capex-outlook-154053660.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CapEx</a> in 2026 which is an increase of 30% on the low side and we have seen the combination of Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>), and Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) expand their CapEx plans for the 2026 fiscal year by over 70% YoY to $610 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I look at the quarter from NVDA, when I look at the guidance, and when I look at the ecosystem that it is supporting, I believe that shares of NVDA are mispriced. The recent drop is likely to result in significant alpha for investors who are willing to ride out the current volatility. I am more bullish than ever about NVDA and this year could be significantly better than the one they just reported.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448500610166_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"861\" data-height=\"330\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448500610166_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NVIDIA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"245\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448500610166_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448500610166_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448500610166_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448500610166_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Following up on my previous article about Nvidia</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since my previous article about NVDA was published in November (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4846504-nvidia-q3-2nd-cheapest-stock-in-the-mag-7\">can be read here</a>) shares have appreciated by 3.22% while the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>) is up 4.94%. NVDA delivered a record breaking Q3 with 62.5% YoY revenue growth which took its valuation to less than 20 times forward earnings. The hyperscalers fueled NVDA's growth with massive CapEx investments as they evolved into the core infrastructure provider for the AI era. While Q3 was very strong their Q4 results were incredible and NVDA just broke several all-time records from revenue to profitability. I am more bullish than ever about NVDA as this is one of the cheapest valuations we have seen for the largest company in the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am following up with a new article because I believe that NVDA is mispriced and the current valuation is creating a large opportunity for shareholders.

NVDA just generated $68.13 billion in revenue which was a 19.51% growth rate QoQ and 73.21% YOY. This quarter proved that NVDA is experiencing reaccelerating growth on a YoY basis. In Q3 2024 NVDA reached a 122.4% YoY growth rate which fell sequentially over the next year to 55.60%. In Q3 their revenue growth rate increased by 6.89% to 62.49% and in Q4 the revenue growth rate increased 10.72% to 73.21%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA’s data center division generated $62.3 billion in revenue in Q4 which was a YoY increase of 75%. In Q4 NVDA generated $51.09 billion in gross profit and $42.96 billion in net income which were both new records. NVDA maintained a 75% gross profit margin while increasing their profit margin by 7.08% to 63.06%. NVDA’s revenue growth and margin is expanding on a YoY basis and they just guided for $78 billion in revenue for their Q1 results which would imply that they are expecting a YoY growth rate of 77.02%.

AI workloads are becoming more inference heavy and more distributed which expands the opportunities for NVDA as their GPUs can be combined with networking, software and full stack systems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA outlined $11B of networking revenue in Q4 and discussed how it led to $31 billion of revenue this year. NVDA is seeing strong adoption in NVLink, Spectrum-X Ethernet, and InfiniBand as their customers are unifying distributed data centers into AI factories. On the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874926-nvidia-corporation-nvda-q4-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a>, NVDA discussed that Blackwell Ultra can deliver up to 50x better performance and 35x lower cost for agentic AI compared to Hopper. They are positioning the Vera Rubin cycle as the next platform that will be a continuation of the AI factory buildout wave. The Rubin platform which is six new chips will target a 10x reduction in inference token cost compared to Blackwell and they are expecting that the hyperscalers will be the first to deploy these systems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is super bullish for NVDA because the roadmap of future chips are being absorbed as quickly as NVDA can ship them. The way that I am looking at this is that as AI becomes agentic its always on and compute is no longer a one-time training event as it becomes a recurring necessity. We are seeing that networking is scaling which is likely to enhance the flywheel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501407676_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"742\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501407676_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Hyperscaler CapEx\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"396\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501407676_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501407676_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501407676_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501407676_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Steven Fiorillo, Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reality is that the combination of META, MSFT, AMZN, and GOOGL allocated $140.13 billion towards CapEx in 2023 then increased their spend by 55.04% ($77.14 billion) in 2024 to $217.27 billion. This year the CapEx spend from these companies increased to $357.51 billion as it grew YoY by 65.55% ($140.24 billion). For the 2026 fiscal year, these companies are projecting to allocate $610 billion toward CapEx which is an additional $252.49 billion and a YoY growth rate of 70.63%. These companies have the balance sheets and the cash flow to fund this build out for years to come, and MSFT reports their full year results in the summer while guiding for the next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that they are still in a \"prisoners dilemma\" situation, especially with the advancements in NVDA’s chips. If the Rubin platform can generate a 10x reduction in inference token cost compared to Blackwell and Blackwell deliver up to 50x better performance and 35x lower cost for agentic AI compared to Hopper these companies have no choice but to upgrade unless they all say no. Any company that doesn’t upgrade will be at a disadvantage because they will have to charge more for compute and they won’t deliver advancements as quickly as their peers. NVDA is at the center of the AI revolution and the buildout doesn’t look like it’s stopping anytime soon.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Nvidia’s valuation is dirt cheap at these levels</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/earnings/estimates\">NVDA</a> just got cheaper as the stock is off more than 5% since the earnings print and the street increased their expected forward earnings. NVDA is expected to generate $8.26 of EPS this year and $13.07 in 2028. This is an increased of 58.32% over the next 2 fiscal years which is the most in the Magnificent Seven. NVDA is trading at 22.36 times this years earnings and 14.13 times 2027 earnings. NVDA is now trading at the cheapest valuation in the Magnificent Seven and companies such as Walmart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>) and Costco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COST\" title=\"Costco Wholesale Corporation\">COST</a>) are trading at valuations that are double NVDA’s with less than half of the EPS growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that the numbers are showing that NVDA is being mispriced on overblown fears about how much more buildout is left in the AI revolution. At these levels, I believe that NVDA is providing investors with a great opportunity to unlock future value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-1772144851671753_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1171\" data-height=\"260\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-1772144851671753_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NVDA Forward EPS\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"142\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-1772144851671753_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-1772144851671753_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-1772144851671753_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-1772144851671753_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Steven Fiorillo, Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>NVIDIA is becoming the Berkshire Hathaway of technology</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557785-nvidia-confirms-its-finalizing-deal-with-openai\">NVDA</a> confirmed that its finalizing its deal with OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>), and I couldn’t be more excited. NVDA previously indicated that it would invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI and deploy at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers with Nvidia systems. There have been reports that the number is closer to $30 billion and this comes after <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4542407-nvidia-invests-2b-in-coreweave-to-help-build-over-5-gw-ai-factories\">NVDA</a> invested $2 billion into CoreWeave (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWV\" title=\"CoreWeave, Inc.\">CRWV</a>) at $87.20 per share. NVDA also expanded their collaboration to accelerate the buildout of over 5 gigawatts of AI factories by 2030 with CRWV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are some in the investment community that are calling these deals <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/09/28/nvidia-openai-circular-financing-ai-bubble/\" rel=\"nofollow\">circular financing</a> as they are becoming more concerned that here is a financial bubble around AI. I am taking the opposite side of this and I welcome NVDA making investments in OpenAI and CRWV. I believe that NVDA is starting to become the Berkshire Hathaway (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.A</a>) of technology, and believe that they should make more investments throughout the AI ecosystem as this is likely to be the largest technological revolution the world has ever seen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The real question is what does a company do when they are generating $14.32 billion in net income per month? In <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20414347-nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2026\">Q4, NVDA</a> generated $42.96 billion in net income which is $14.32 billion per month and on an annualized basis they generated $120.07 billion in net income for the year which was $2.31 billion per week. Based on the Q4 results, NVDA is on a run rate of $171.84 billion in net income for this fiscal year, which is 3.3 billion per week of pure profit. Companies can buy back shares, pay down debt, pay dividends, reinvest in themselves, or make investments with their treasure trove of profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA has $7.47 billion in long-term debt on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a> with $62.56 billion in cash on hand. They are already buying back <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/cash-flow-statement\">$48.03 billion</a> worth of shares. As a shareholder I love the idea of NVDA making investments into companies such as OpenAI and CRWV and hope it doesn’t stop there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502681885_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1268\" data-height=\"825\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502681885_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CES Presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"416\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502681885_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502681885_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502681885_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502681885_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Nvidia Corporation </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When NVDA makes an investment into these companies it is trading cash for equity. Currently CRWV is trading at $96.39 which is 10.54% higher than where NVDA purchased $2 billion worth of shares at. This means that NVDA has shares of CRWV that were worth roughly $2.21 billion on the balance sheet, which is a better ROI then plowing the capital into bonds. The current funding round for <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-19/openai-nears-100-billion-funding-at-850-billion-valuation\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenAI</a> will place its valuation at $850 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If NVDA allocated $50 billion towards the deal, they would own 5.88% of OpenAI, and if they allocate $100 billion toward OpenAI they would own 11.76% of the company. An investment of $50 billion or $100 billion is not a small amount but the reality is that both numbers will likely be a fraction of NVDA’s profitability this year. NVDA has the cash to make these investments and if OpenAI becomes a multi trillion dollar company over the next 5-10 years shareholders of NVDA will benefit a great deal by having a significant amount of ownership of it on the balance sheet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other aspect that many individuals are overlooking is that this isn’t funny accounting. NVDA is making cash investments in these companies for hard equity that sits on their books. What these companies choose to do with that capital is their business. The fact that they will be buying more GPU’s from NVDA is an added bonus that NVDA will recognize 100% of the profits because they already traded the cash for the equity. The sale of the GPU’s is a completely separate transaction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that a lot of people believe that NVDA is funding the future sales of GPUs with its own money which isn’t the case. NVDA traded their capital for the equity in these companies and the sale of GPUS will be just an added benefit. Over time I believe that these types of deals will generate a tremendous amount of value for NVDA and their shareholders and I wouldn’t be surprised if we see more deals like this from NVDA in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks to investing in Nvidia</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I am bullish on NVDA there are several risk factors to consider. NVDA just delivered 73.21% YoY growth and guided for $78 billion of revenue in Q1 which would be 77.02% YoY growth and the market punished them. Shares are selling off after what could be the best quarter in the history of the stock market as no company this size has ever grew their quarterly revenue by 73% YoY. Even though revenue is reaccelerating the market is clearly concerned about when the revenue growth will slowdown and when the CapEx buildout will turn from expansion to maintenance. NVDA is at the mercy of the hyperscalers deploying CapEx and if the market can convince them that they are spending too much on AI infrastructure the recent selloff after Q4 earnings may look mild compared to what could happen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA is a victim of its own success, and the fact that it couldn’t break out after this quarter could be a signal that we have seen a top in its shares. Investors should do their own due diligence, as there isn’t going to be a bell that signals the investments into the AI revolution are curtailing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was another drop the mic moment for NVDA as their Q4 revenue signaled the reacceleration of growth wasn’t a fluke in Q3. I am shocked that shares sold off more than -5% after earnings as the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/earnings/estimates\">analyst community</a> is signaling that NVDA will deliver roughly $259.34 billion in revenue which is a 66.41% YoY growth rate. NVDA is now trading at the cheapest levels the market has seen is quite some time as investors are able to pay less than 24 times this year earnings and less than 20 times next years earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After reading through the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874926-nvidia-corporation-nvda-q4-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a> and looking at the data from the hyperscalers, I don’t believe we are anywhere close to the AI buildout being over as each generation of NVDA’s chips provide advancements that they are unable to live without. The market is punishing many companies related to the data center buildout which is creating an opportunity for long-term investors. While the markets can be irrational at times I believe that shares of NVDA will rebound and have a good chance of reaching $250 in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501352518_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1213\" data-height=\"339\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501352518_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NVDA Forward Revenue\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"179\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501352518_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501352518_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501352518_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501352518_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The Q&amp;A starts. And within minutes, someone asks the question that always shows up:</p> <p><em>“Why is it down?”</em></p> <p>Sometimes it’s a stock you own. Sometimes it’s one you’re watching. Sometimes it’s a<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> company that </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content\">shouldn’t</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> be down because, on paper, it looks “fine.” The dividend is still getting paid. The business isn’t bankrupt. Yet, the market has decided to take a chunk out of the price.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here’s the thing: a stock can be down for a dozen reasons - and most investors look in the wrong place first. They hunt for a headline, a tweet, or a hot take. That approach usually creates more stress than clarity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What you want instead is a repeatable process. One you can use every time a stock drops, whether it’s down 5% in a day or 25% over six months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s walk through the exact checklist I use to answer “Why is it down?” - and more importantly, to decide whether it’s a <em>problem</em>... or an <em>opportunity</em>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 1: Let the Numbers Speak First (but don’t stop there)</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before you read opinions, read facts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Start with the basics: <em>revenue, profit, and the dividend</em>. In most cases, one of those three will explain the move (or at least point you in the right direction).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A stock is often down because the latest results show one of these:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue slowed, declined, or missed expectations</li> <li>Earnings dropped (or the market thinks they will)</li> <li>Margins compressed (costs rose faster than sales)</li> <li>Management guided lower for the next quarter or year</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Compare the right periods.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Year-over-year (Q1 vs. Q1 last year) is usually the cleanest comparison, because businesses are seasonal. Ski companies don’t sell skis in July, and hardware stores don’t move snowblowers in May.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sometimes management highlights sequential improvement (Q1 vs. Q4) if last year’s quarter was unusually strong or weak. That can be useful, but your default should be year-over-year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 2: Go Deeper into the Quarterly Earnings Story</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Once you’ve spotted what moved, the next job is to find <em>why</em>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is where most investors stop too early. They read: “EPS down 12%” and assume the company is in trouble. But “EPS down” can mean many different things.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here are common scenarios that push stocks lower:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Revenue is stable, but EPS is falling.</strong>That’s often a margin story. Input costs, wages, shipping, marketing, or discounting ate into profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Revenue is rising, but EPS is shrinking.</strong>This can happen when growth comes with costs: a new product rollout, an expansion, or an acquisition that hasn’t paid off yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>EPS dropped because of “one-time” items.</strong>Impairment charges, restructuring costs, legal settlements, or write-downs can crush reported earnings. They may not be recurring - but they still matter because they signal something changed.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">And one important reminder: EPS isn’t always the best metric.</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For capital-intensive businesses (pipelines, utilities, telecoms) and REITs, earnings can look ugly due to depreciation and other non-cash items. In those cases, metrics like DCF per share, FFO per share, or AFFO per share may tell the real story. If you judge the wrong business with the wrong tool, you’ll draw the wrong conclusion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 3: Use the Dividend Triangle as Your Health Check</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When a stock is down, your brain wants to stare at the price chart. I’d rather you look at the <a href=\"https://thedividendguyblog.com/dividend-triangle/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">Dividend Triangle</a> and ask three questions:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Are revenues growing?</li> <li>Are earnings (or the right cash metric) growing?</li> <li>Is the dividend growing?</li> </ul> <figure class=\"paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_dividend-triangle.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Dividend triangle representation.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_dividend-triangle.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_dividend-triangle.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_dividend-triangle.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Dividend triangle representation.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But here’s the nuance: metrics alone don’t tell the full story. Trends do.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Two companies can have similar revenue growth this year but very different realities:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>One has a steady, repeatable upward slope.</li> <li>The other is bouncing around with more volatility than your teenager’s mood.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That difference matters. A slowing trend in earnings, or in dividend growth losing steam, is often where the early warning signs appear. The Dividend Triangle <em>trendline</em> tells you whether the business is strengthening or weakening.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 4: Zoom Out - This Is Where You Avoid Dumb Decisions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A single bad quarter is not a trend. It’s a data point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s why you look at 3-5 years of quarterly progression. You’re trying to categorize what you’re seeing:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Blip - One ugly quarter in an otherwise stable upward trend</li> <li>Business as usual - The result looks weak, but it’s within the normal pattern</li> <li>Trend change - Multiple quarters moving in the wrong direction</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is the step that turns panic into perspective. If you skip it, you’re basically letting the market’s mood swing control your portfolio.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 5: Identify the Narrative</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stocks don’t move on numbers alone. They move on the story investors tell about those numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The usual narratives look like this:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Demand is weakening</li> <li>Pricing power is fading</li> <li>Costs are rising</li> <li>Debt is becoming a headwind</li> <li>A major shift is underway</li> <li>A disruptive event hit the business</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Your job is to connect the dots between the numbers and the story. Not to find a comforting explanation - just the most accurate one.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 6: Read CEO Comments Like a Human, Not Like a Fan</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management commentary matters because tone changes before numbers do.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Listen for:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Are they confident and specific - or vague and defensive?</li> <li>Are they taking action - or blaming external forces?</li> <li>Are they raising guidance, maintaining it, or quietly walking it back?</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A great CEO doesn’t promise perfection. They explain what they control, what they don’t, and what they’re doing next.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 7: Check the News, but Filter for Relevance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sometimes the stock is down for reasons that have nothing to do with that company:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Rate moves hit utilities and REITs</li> <li>A sector selloff hits everything in the group</li> <li>A macro scare triggers a market-wide risk-off mood</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The question isn’t “What’s the headline?” It’s:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Is this company-specific or environment-driven?</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That distinction changes your decision.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 8: Expectations Can Be Brutal</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sometimes the market is simply too demanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is where investors get confused: the company reports strong results... and the stock still gets punished.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A perfect example was Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>). After earnings, the stock dropped more than 10% even though it delivered revenue growth of 17%, cloud growth of 29%, and an EPS increase of 24%. Apparently, that wasn’t “good enough.” The issue wasn’t the quarter - it was <em>expectations</em>, valuation, and investor nerves around massive AI capex and when the payoff shows up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I explained that whole setup in my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872805-volatility-starting-year-january-2026-dividend-income-report\">January Dividend Income Report</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s the lesson: stocks don’t fall only because results are bad. They fall because results are less impressive than what the market already priced in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When a stock is down, you’re not hunting for a quick explanation. You’re running a process that leads to one of three outcomes:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The business is fine. The price is noisy.</li> <li>The business has a real issue, but it looks fixable.</li> <li>The story is deteriorating and the dividend triangle is cracking.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And here’s the part that brings it all together:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reasons you buy a stock are often the same reasons you eventually sell it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When the core drivers break, the thesis breaks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://thedividendguyblog.com/why-is-it-down-the-investor-question-that-never-goes-away/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

More specifically, my last <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4769029-bhp-group-better-than-vale-if-you-really-want-mining-exposure\">BHP<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> article</span></a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> was published on Mar 20, 2025, and my last </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4778569-rio-tinto-vs-vale-inventory-doesnt-lie\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">RIO article</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> was published on April 27, 2025. Both articles focused on the tariff risks at that point. I gave both stocks a Hold rating due to my outlook for the tariff uncertainties to translate into near-term demand and pricing headwinds for raw materials. Since then, much has changed both in terms of company specifics and macroeconomics. In terms of company specifics, both have released updated earnings reports and new EPS guidance. In terms of macroeconomics, the geopolitical uncertainties and ore prices have also changed considerably.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With these changes, the investment thesis for this follow-up is twofold. First, I will explain why these changes have made both BHP and RIO stocks timely candidates for Ray Dalio’s AWP (All-weather portfolio). Due to their commodity exposure, including these miners in a portfolio can help to hedge against structural shifts in the global economy, particularly inflation. Second, I will argue why between these two mining leaders, BHP emerges as the even better candidate due to its superior operational margins, and also stronger financial strength. These considerations have led me to update my rating on BHP to Buy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">BHP, RIO, and commodity cycles</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Readers following our approach know that our foundational investing strategy is heavily influenced by Ray Dalio’s thinking. In particular, his AWP framework is designed to perform across all four economic regimes during a macroscopic cycle. Commodities specifically target the rising prices regime featuring elevated inflation. Judging by the changes in commodity prices since my last writings, leadings miners such as BHP and RIO appear very timely under the AWP framework. To wit, the chart below displays the price of global price of iron ore, a major product that is substantial profit stream for both BHP and RIO stocks. Before going into any details, let me first point out the notorious volatilities and cyclicality the prices have demonstrated in its latest boom and bust cycle as shown. In the past 10 years, the price has more than quadrupled (from around $40 per metric ton in 2016 to ~$220 in 2021) and then approximately halved since the 2021 peak.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this overall observation, let’s now focus more on the details in the past 1 year or so. As seen, shortly since my last writings, the ore prices have indeed suffered downward pressure and reached a bottom of around $96 per ton in mid-2025. Since then, the prices have recovered by quite a bit to the current level of $107, an increase of more than 11%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242746452308_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1824\" data-height=\"973\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242746452308_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"341\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242746452308_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242746452308_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242746452308_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242746452308_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With these changes, my assessment is that the contracting phase of the commodity cycle (that started between 2021 and 2022) has largely run its course already. As such, I expect the ore prices to remain stable and should start the recovery phase in the near future. As a reflection, the profit margins of both companies have demonstrated improvements since my last articles as shown in the chart below. In particular, BHP’s gross margin has expanded to 83.09% with the updated financials in its latest earnings report, which started to exceed its 5-year average of 82.2%. From this chart, you can also see the first reason that makes BHP a better fit for the AWP. BHP has demonstrated superior profitability over RIO on most metrics ranging from gross margin, net margin, FCF margin, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270404833_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"935\" data-height=\"446\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270404833_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"305\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270404833_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270404833_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270404833_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270404833_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">BHP and RIO: balance sheet in focus</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For businesses with exposure to highly cyclical earnings, I especially prefer those with a more conservative balanced sheet in general. On this front, BHP is certainly the more favorable candidate for me. To start, BHP features a much higher holistic Altman Z score than RIO. For investors unfamiliar with the concept, the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/altman.asp#:~:text=The%20Altman%20Z%2Dscore%20is%20a%20formula%20for%20determining%20whether,%2C%20solvency%2C%20and%20activity%20ratios.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Altman Z-score</a> is a metric that captures the overall financial strength of a business by factoring multiple parameters across all the financial statements. As a rule of thumb, I like to see a score of 3 or above for businesses with cyclical behavior such as BHP and RIO. The Altman Z scores of for BHP are above this threshold (3.03 per its latest financials), while the for RIO fell a bit short (2.46).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270408985_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"968\" data-height=\"250\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270408985_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"165\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270408985_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270408985_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270408985_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270408985_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After seeing the forest, let’s examine a tree more closely. The next chart shows BHP and RIO stock's current and historical interest coverage. As seen, BHP Group has demonstrated far safer coverage than RIO in recent years. To wit, its Times Interest Earned ratio climbed from a mid-2024 low of approximately 16x to the current level of more than 25x. Conversely, Rio Tinto’s coverage has deteriorated significantly over the same period, falling from around 18x in mid-2024 to about 13x presently, only about half of BHP’s coverage ratio. With these contrasts, I see BHP in a much better position to reinvest in growth and weather headwinds (such as interest rate risks and commodity price risks).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242705200164_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1308\" data-height=\"484\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242705200164_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"char\" width=\"640\" height=\"237\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242705200164_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242705200164_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242705200164_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242705200164_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">BHP and RIO: valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of valuation, RIO is certainly the more attractive one on this front. To wit, the data below shows BHP’s valuation premium over RIO on several earnings-based metrics. For example, BHP’s Non-GAAP P/E for the current fiscal year stands at 16.66, which is significantly higher than Rio Tinto’s P/E of 11.91 by about 40%. This trend continues into the future fiscal years too.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, my view is that BHP’s valuation is not as expensive as headline P/E ratios suggest relative to RIO due to the differences in profitability metrics and also balance sheets as analyzed above. Higher profitability margins tend to lead into better earing-cash conversion. As a result, BHP’s Price/Cash Flow ratio is about 10.35 only. It is not only far below its P/E ratio but also not that higher when compared to Rio Tinto’s 9.76. The difference is about 7% only, in contrast to the 40% difference in P/E ratios. Further, due to BHP’s better balance sheet strength, EV-based valuation metrics also show a much tighter spread. For example, BHP’s trailing EV/EBITDA is actually lower at 8.61 compared to Rio Tinto’s 9.32.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242704424622_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"902\" data-height=\"307\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242704424622_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"218\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242704424622_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242704424622_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242704424622_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242704424622_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other risks and final thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before closing, let me articulate that I am NOT trying to argue that RIO is a bad choice. It is a strong candidate in itself (and hence my reiterated Hold rating). Besides its attractive valuation metrics and also leading position, it also offers a few key differentiate catalysts in my view. To start, Rio Tinto has a large exposure (or even dominance in my view) in the aluminum sector. Besides offering a diversified, this exposure could also offer a hedge against energy cost rises as aluminum production is extremely energy-intensive and Rio Tinto has developed substantially integrated power assets. Additionally, Rio Tinto and Amazon AWS have recently <a href=\"https://www.riotinto.com/en/news/releases/2026/rio-tinto-and-amazon-web-services-collaborate-to-bring-low-carbon-nuton-copper-to-u-s--data-centres\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> a collaboration to bring low-carbon Nuton copper to U.S. data centers (see more details quoted below). I see large odds for this collation to expand with AMZN’s aggressive CAPAX plan in the years ahead.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>TUCSON, Ariz. (Jan 15, 2026): Rio Tinto today announces a strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) that will see AWS become Nuton® Technology’s first customer following the breakthrough industrial-scale deployment of the innovative bioleaching technology at the Johnson Camp copper mine in the U.S. last month.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To close, this reexamination of BHP and RIO is motivated by changes both in terms of company specifics and macroeconomics since my last writings about a year ago. Changes in the former bucket include their updated earnings reports, profit metrics, and valuation ratios. Changes in the latter bucket include ore prices and my assessment of the commodity cycle. These changes have made BHP and RIO stocks both interesting candidates for Ray Dalio’s AWP idea.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see BHP as the even better candidate due to its superior margins and stronger balance sheet. Furthermore, its valuation premium relative to RIO is not as large as on the surface. For these considerations, this reexamining concludes with an upgraded rating on BHP to Buy.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The fund does reasonably well in this task, as it boasts an<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> 11.49% yield at the current share price, which is significantly higher than most other assets in the market possess. However, as is the case with all of the closed-end funds currently offered by DoubleLine, DSL achieves its objectives primarily by investing its assets into a portfolio comprised of bonds. Bonds only offer extremely limited upside when compared to common stocks, which is due to the simple fact that bonds are both issued and redeemed at their face values, so they offer no net capital gains when held over their lifetimes. As a result of this, investors in this fund should not expect to earn much beyond the distribution. Indeed, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund has delivered no share price appreciation over the past ten years, and all of the returns that it has provided to its investors have come from the distribution. With that said, though, given the fact that this fund has a substantially higher yield than any of the benchmark bond indices, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund should offer superior total returns to any exchange-traded index fund that tracks a bond index.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund Versus Bond Index Funds</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As mentioned in the introduction, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund primarily invests its assets in bonds and similar fixed-income securities. The fund’s <a href=\"https://doubleline.com/funds/income-solutions-fund/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a> states:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The Fund will seek to achieve its investment objectives by investing in a portfolio of investments selected for their potential to provide high current income, growth of capital, or both. The Fund may invest in debt securities and other income-producing investments anywhere in the world, including emerging markets.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This quote explicitly states that one thing that the fund’s management is looking for is an asset’s ability to provide growth of capital. As was mentioned in the introduction, most bonds are incapable of doing this as they are issued at face value and return the face value to their owners whenever the bond matures. As such, anyone who purchases a bond when it is first issued and holds it until it matures will have absolutely no growth of capital. Furthermore, anyone who purchases a bond at a price that is above its face value is actually guaranteed to have a negative growth of capital. It is not uncommon for bonds to trade at prices above their face values during periods of time in which interest rates are extraordinarily low. In fact, bonds will usually trade above their face values whenever the coupon rate on the bond is higher than what the same bond would have if it were issued today. Over the past fifteen years, market interest rates have typically been lower than they are today. However, prior to the financial crisis of 2008, bond yields were typically higher than during the period that followed it. As such, it has been extremely difficult, if not impossible, to actually achieve growth of capital from most bonds over the past few decades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, there are two types of bonds that can deliver growth of capital over their lifetimes. These two types are:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><span>Convertible bonds, if the bond is converted into common stock prior to its maturity date,</span></li> <li><span>Bonds that have a face value denominated in a currency that is different from the investor’s own home currency.</span></li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>It is arguable whether the second type of bond is truly delivering growth of capital. This is because the bond’s gain comes from the investor’s home currency declining against the currency in which the bond is denominated. The bond itself did not actually deliver any increase in value because it still returns the same amount that was actually lent. All that has changed is that the investor’s home currency is worth less.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund does not have any convertible bonds in its portfolio.

As such, it is not using this particular asset class to generate growth of capital. It is also unlikely that the small allocation to common stocks will deliver any meaningful growth, given the companies that the fund is invested in:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699381001644_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1878\" data-height=\"514\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699381001644_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL Common Stock Holdings Dec. 31 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"175\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699381001644_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699381001644_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699381001644_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699381001644_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DSL Q1 2026 Holdings Report</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Whenever a company goes bankrupt, it will sometimes convert its outstanding debt into common stock and issue this stock to the bondholders. It seems highly likely that DSL obtained its common stock positions via this method, given that several of these firms are not publicly traded and went through bankruptcy proceedings in past years. Thus, these are not so much investments as they are common stocks that the fund simply received along the way and now has no reason to sell (or is unable to sell) for whatever reason.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund does, however, have relatively high exposure to foreign bonds. We can see that, as of December 31, 2025, fully 48.4% of the fund’s assets were invested in either foreign corporate bonds or foreign government bonds. This does not necessarily mean that these bonds are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, however. It is not uncommon for a company or a country to issue bonds denominated in U.S. dollars. In fact, this is very common among those entities that are based in emerging markets due to the simple fact that many international investors do not trust emerging market currencies. As such, the fund’s exposure to non-U.S. dollar-denominated bonds is likely lower than the 48.4% of net assets that the asset allocation chart suggests. The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund, unfortunately, does not explicitly state what its foreign currency exposure actually is. However, given that the fund did have $37,305,132 (2.7% of net assets) invested in the DoubleLine Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DBELX\" title=\"DoubleLine Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond I\">DBELX</a>) as of December 31, 2025, it does have some foreign currency exposure. We just do not know exactly how much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the above chart shows, the portfolio of the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund essentially resembles that of a global bond fund. As such, it would be most appropriate to compare the fund to global bond indices. This chart clearly shows that the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund has a substantially better yield than any of the main American or global bond indices:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Index/ETF</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Current Yield</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AGG\" title=\"iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF\">AGG</a>)</p></td> <td><p>3.85%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Bloomberg High Yield Very Liquid Index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JNK\" title=\"State Street SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF\">JNK</a>)</p></td> <td><p>6.54%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Vanguard Total World Bond ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BNDW\" title=\"Vanguard Total World Bond ETF\">BNDW</a>)</p></td> <td><p>4.08%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BNDX\" title=\"Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund ETF\">BNDX</a>)</p></td> <td><p>4.35%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>J.P.

This particular index tracks the price and yield performance of speculative-grade bonds issued by corporations in the United States. In other words, it tracks the price and yield performance of bonds in which the issuer is considered to have a high risk of defaulting on the bond. <a href=\"https://www.efficientfrontier.com/ef/401/junk.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">According to Moody’s</a>, a BB-rated junk bond has a 1.5% chance of defaulting in any given year, and a B-rated junk bond has a 7% chance of defaulting in any given year. Naturally, whenever a bond issuer defaults, bond investors frequently lose all of the money that they invested in the bond. Despite the relatively high default risk, the American junk bond index only yields 6.54% at the current level. It is arguable whether or not this is actually high enough to compensate investors for the risk of loss here. After all, the yield of the junk bond index is only 2.69% higher than the yield of the investment-grade bond index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AGG\" title=\"iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF\">AGG</a>), which consists of bonds that have a substantially lower risk of default.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As mentioned in the introduction, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund has a yield of 11.49% at the current share price, so it is substantially higher than that of the American junk bond index. It is unclear whether or not the fund invests in riskier assets than those included in the index in order to achieve this outcome. The fund’s website provides the following breakdown of the credit quality of the bonds that comprise its portfolio:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699389006011.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL Holdings by Credit Quality\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"619\" height=\"660\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699389006011.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699389006011.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699389006011.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DoubleLine</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of January 31, 2026, the fund had 74.12% of its total assets invested in speculative-grade bonds.

Thus, any index fund that tracks the Bloomberg High Yield Very Liquid Index will have 100% of its assets invested in junk bonds. That is a much higher allocation than DSL currently has.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the website for the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund does not break its assets down further than shown above. The website does not, for example, specify what proportion of the fund’s holdings consist of CAA1 and CAA2 bonds. It is possible that the junk bonds in the fund’s portfolio consist of the riskiest (and therefore highest-yielding) junk bonds on the market, while the JNK ETF only has a relatively small allocation to those bonds. Thus, unless DoubleLine provides a breakdown of the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund by the specific letter grades of the securities in the portfolio, we cannot be certain whether or not DSL is taking on greater risks than the index funds in order to achieve a higher yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, one thing that we can be sure of is that the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund is using leverage as a method of boosting the effective yield that it earns from its net assets. The way that this works is that the fund borrows money and then uses the money that it borrows to buy bonds and similar debt securities. It then uses the coupons that it receives from these purchased securities to pay the interest on the borrowed money. If the bonds that the fund purchased pay more than is necessary to cover the interest on the fund’s debt, the fund is allowed to keep the surplus money. This ultimately results in the yield that the fund receives as a percentage of its net assets being higher than it would be if the fund did not use leverage. The fund’s most recent holdings report states that the fund’s portfolio consisted of securities that were worth $1,748,727,149 on December 31, 2025. However, the fund also had $388,984,550 in debt that it owed on that date. The net assets were only $1,359,742,599, but it collects coupon payments on the $1.7 billion amount. Thus, the fund’s income should actually be higher than it would be if the only assets that it controlled were the ones that were purchased with its net assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most recent <a href=\"https://pex.broadridge.com/summary.asp?doctype=ann&amp;cid=dbline&amp;fid=258622109\" rel=\"nofollow\">financial statements</a> for the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund reinforce this conclusion. For the twelve-month period that ended on September 30, 2025, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund received an income of $159,818,963 from the assets in its portfolio. This is an 11.28% yield on the fund’s average net assets of $1,416,805,329 over the period. This is clearly higher than any of the bond indices provide, and indeed, it is higher than just about any individual bonds provide. Thus, we can clearly see that the fund’s leverage is providing a boost to the effective yield that it earns from its net assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As was already noted, bonds deliver essentially all of their total returns through direct payments that they make to their investors. As such, for the most part, higher yields translate into higher total returns. This is true for many bond funds as well, not just for individual bonds. As the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund has a higher yield than any of the indices, we would therefore expect it to offer higher total returns than index funds tracking the major American or global bond indices. Indeed, this is what we see, as clearly shown here:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699272076936_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1195\" data-height=\"413\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699272076936_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL vs Indices 10-Yr.

As is clearly shown, the fund managed to outperform all of the indices by a considerable margin. However, please note that the above chart assumes that an investor used the distributions that were paid out by each of these funds to purchase additional shares on the distribution payment date. This may not be a realistic assumption for bond investors, though, as many of those individuals who actually invest in bonds would prefer to take the distributions as cash.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, however, investors who actually take this fund’s distributions as cash end up disappointed. Over the past ten years, the share price of the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund declined by 29.42%. This was a substantially worse performance than any of the bond indices delivered over the same period:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699278576806_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1202\" data-height=\"419\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699278576806_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL vs Indices 10-Yr.

However, the fact that the fund’s share price declined by almost 30% suggests that the fund has not consistently covered the distributions that it pays out. After all, the share price of a closed-end fund typically correlates with its net asset value (although it is not as precise of a correlation as an exchange-traded fund experiences). This statement proves to be correct in this instance, as we can see in this chart:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699284934053_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1214\" data-height=\"439\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699284934053_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL vs NAV 10-Yr.

As we can see, both exhibited a very strong correlation with one another. Furthermore, the net asset value of the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund also declined over the period, as it declined by 33.16% over the ten-year period. The fact that the fund’s net asset value declined over the period means that the fund did not manage to cover its distributions over the period. While this is certainly concerning, it is worth noting that the fund cut its distribution in late 2020 following the losses that it suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, most of the net asset value decline was due to the fund continuing to pay out distributions throughout 2020 despite the massive sell-off of bonds in March, as well as the increase in interest rates during 2022. The bond market stabilized somewhat beginning in 2023, and the fund has done a better job maintaining its distribution since that time:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699291123552_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1190\" data-height=\"418\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699291123552_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL vs NAV 3-Yr.

Indeed, the fund’s net asset value is down over the period. As such, investors may want to use caution when considering purchasing shares of the fund.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund Versus Other Bond CEFs</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As was just discussed, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund is able to employ certain strategies that allow it to earn a higher level of income and boast a higher yield than most bond index funds. This is not the only fund on the market that is able to use similar strategies, however. In fact, many closed-end bond funds are able to do so, and as a result, they are able to be much more competitive in terms of yield. We can see that here:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Fund Name</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Morningstar Classification</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Current Yield</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>11.49%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>BrandywineGLOBAL – Global Income Opportunities Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BWG\" title=\"BrandywineGLOBAL - Global Income Opptys Fd Inc\">BWG</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>11.51%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>MFS Multimarket Income Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MMT\" title=\"MFS Multimarket Income Trust\">MMT</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>8.65%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Nuveen Global High Income Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JGH\" title=\"Nuveen Global High Income Fund\">JGH</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>9.76%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>PIMCO Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PDO\" title=\"PIMCO Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund\">PDO</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>11.00%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Putnam Premier Income Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PPT\" title=\"Putnam Premier Income Trust\">PPT</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>8.60%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Western Asset Global Corporate Defined Opportunity Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GDO\" title=\"Western Asset Global Corporate Opportunity Fd Inc.\">GDO</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>12.86%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>abrdn Global Income Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCO\" title=\"abrdn Global Income Fund Inc\">FCO</a>)</p></td> <td><p>Fixed Income – Taxable-Global Income</p></td> <td><p>26.17%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The median yield of this group of eight closed-end funds is 11.25%, which is slightly below the yield of the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund. Thus, the yield of this fund should seem fairly reasonable to many income investors. We can see, however, that DSL also does not have the highest yield in the peer group. At its current level, its yield is only slightly above that of the median fund in the group. There are a number of funds with higher yields and thus a number of funds that will provide their investors with a higher level of income. Many income-seeking investors might be inclined to seek out other options given this. However, the fact that this fund does not have a particularly outsized yield relative to its peers suggests that the market is not pricing in a distribution cut. If it were, then the fund’s yield would be well above the median, as is the case with the abrdn Global Income Fund. As one of the things that we look for as income investors is a sustainable income, the fact that the market does not seem to expect a distribution cut is an attractive characteristic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The correlation between yield and total return that we saw in the previous section does not necessarily apply when considering closed-end funds. As we can see here, the funds with the highest yields do not have the highest total returns over the trailing ten-year period:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Fund Name</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Trailing Ten-Year Total Return</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund</p></td> <td><p>97.04%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>BrandywineGLOBAL – Global Income Opportunities Fund</p></td> <td><p>85.08%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>MFS Multimarket Income Trust</p></td> <td><p>95.52%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Nuveen Global High Income Fund</p></td> <td><p>142.76%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>PIMCO Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund</p></td> <td><p>n/a</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Putnam Premier Income Trust</p></td> <td><p>66.40%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Western Asset Global Corporate Defined Opportunity Fund</p></td> <td><p>68.53%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>abrdn Global Income Fund</p></td> <td><p>43.40%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The highest-yielding funds in this peer group are GDO and FCO, and we can clearly see that they were not the best funds to own in terms of total return. There is a reason for this, and it comes down to the fact that a closed-end fund can overdistribute. While it is generally not a good idea for a closed-end fund that is intended to last for perpetuity (as most of them are) to pay out more than its investment profits, there are no legal restrictions that forbid them from doing so. Indeed, a closed-end fund can technically pay out as much money as it wants to until its net asset value reaches zero. This seems to be the policy of the abrdn Global Income Fund, as its net asset value has been consistently declining over the past ten years:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699297253358_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1196\" data-height=\"409\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699297253358_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FCO NAV 10-Yr.

As we already saw, this was worse than the net asset value decline suffered by the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund over the same period. Indeed, it is substantially worse. The cause of this is that the fund is distributing significantly more than it earns from its assets and destroying its net asset value in the process. As the fund’s net asset value declines, its share price also declines, and this decline in the share price offsets the high yield. As such, it is usually best to stick with a fund that is at least trying to keep its distributions in line with its investment profits. The DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund does much better here, although it was not the best fund overall over the past ten years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recent Performance Update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We last <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4800500-dsl-this-popular-bond-fund-is-destroying-purchasing-power\">discussed</a> the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund on July 10, 2025. As such, approximately seven-and-a-half months have passed since the last time that we looked at this fund. As we all know, many things can happen over a seven-month period. That was certainly the case with this one, and as such, there are a few things that we should discuss to understand the performance of this fund since that time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the most important things that occurred over the past seven months that had an impact on bonds and bond prices is the resumption of the Federal Reserve’s attempts to ease monetary policy. This came in the form of three 25-basis point cuts to the federal funds target rate, which occurred in September, October, and December:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699303455665_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1654\" data-height=\"608\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699303455665_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EFFR Article-to-Article Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"235\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699303455665_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699303455665_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699303455665_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699303455665_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The effective federal funds rate was 4.33% the last time that we reviewed the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund. Today, it is at 3.64%, or 69 basis points below the July level. This is in line with the 75-basis points of cuts to the federal funds target rate, although the central bank did not manage to force the federal funds rate down by the entire 75 basis points. The current effective federal funds rate is in the target range, however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We should note that the Federal Reserve only directly controls short-term interest rates. Long-term interest rates, such as those paid by most bonds, are not under the direct control of the nation’s central bank. This is why we can sometimes get situations such as what happened at the end of 2024, when the yields on long-term bonds rose despite the Federal Reserve reducing its benchmark federal funds target rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It was a bit of a different story in the current period, however. As was just mentioned, the Federal Reserve reduced its benchmark federal funds target rate by 75 basis points since July. This did not cause the interest rate on long-term bonds to rise as it did back in 2024. Rather, the coupon yields on long-term bonds declined in response to this event, although they did not decline by nearly as much as the federal funds rate did.

As we can see, long-term U.S. Treasury yields have only declined by 19 to 33 basis points, depending on the term. This is far less than the decline in short-term yields that occurred over the period. As such, the yield curve has steepened.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bond funds such as the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund mostly invest in notes and bonds, rather than in ultra-short-term bills. As we can see here, over half of the bonds held in DSL’s portfolio have maturity dates that are between 3 years and 5 years into the future:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699312327642.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL Maturity Date Schedule Across Portfolio\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"593\" height=\"644\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699312327642.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699312327642.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699312327642.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DoubleLine</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the yield curve has steepened, the bonds in the fund’s portfolio may not have seen their yields decline as much as would ordinarily be assumed, given 75 basis points of cuts by the Federal Reserve.

As such, caution may be recommended, as situations such as this could very easily result in a distribution cut if the fund’s management cannot correct this problem.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even if we take the fund’s distributions into account, the DoubleLine Income Solution Fund substantially underperformed the bond indices:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-1772169933350722_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"413\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-1772169933350722_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DSL vs Indices Total Return Article-to-Article Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"220\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-1772169933350722_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-1772169933350722_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-1772169933350722_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-1772169933350722_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fortunately, we do see that the fund managed to deliver a positive total return over the period. The distributions that it paid out over the period were greater than the decline in the share price. However, investors still would have been better off with any of the index funds. The emerging market bond index fund, in particular, did very well, which may have been partly due to the fact that emerging markets in general have <a href=\"https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/insights/emerging-market-debt-outlook-the-return-of-goldilocks\" rel=\"nofollow\">lower debt and less fiscal pressures</a> than developed countries. Emerging market debt (particularly emerging market debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar) did remarkably well in 2025, and we can see that reflected above. While the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund does have some exposure to emerging market debt, it was clearly unable to capitalize on the strength in that sector as illustrated by its performance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Forward Outlook For The Fund</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While perhaps not as common as in 2024, it is still fairly often that I see financial commentators <a href=\"https://global.morningstar.com/en-nd/bonds/why-2026-will-be-turning-point-bonds\" rel=\"nofollow\">suggest</a> that bonds will do fairly well as an asset class in 2026. The reasons for these calls usually revolve around predictions that the Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates this year and that inflation will decline. However, these two drivers might not be as good for bonds as some analysts expect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One common suggestion in favor of bonds is that interest rates should come down as the Federal Reserve reduces interest rates. It is true that the Federal Reserve is expected to continue with its interest rate-cutting program that began back in 2024. Indeed, as of right now, the market believes that there is a 33.0% chance that there will be two 25-basis point cuts to the federal funds target rate by the end of this year:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699339966426_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1287\" data-height=\"690\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699339966426_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FED FUND Predictions YE2026\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"343\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699339966426_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699339966426_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699339966426_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699339966426_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, we can note in the chart above that the market believes that it is more likely that there will be three 25-basis point cuts than that there will be one cut by the end of the year. In fact, the market currently believes that there is a 59.3% chance that the federal funds target range will be cut by either 50 or 75 basis points by the end of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is an inverse correlation between interest rates and bond prices. Whenever interest rates decline, bond prices increase and vice versa. The argument for buying bonds, therefore, becomes that the Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate cuts will reduce interest rates all across the yield curve and thus cause bond prices to rise. There are two problems with this thesis. The first is that interest rates on bonds do not always decline whenever the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. We saw this in the final three months of 2024. In fact, the yield of the ten-year U.S. Treasury note is higher today than it was on September 16, 2024. The reason that I chose that date is that it was the day before the Federal Open Market Committee met and made the decision to cut the federal funds target rate by 50 basis points (the first rate cut of the current cycle). On September 16, 2024, the ten-year U.S. Treasury note closed at 3.63%. Today, the ten-year U.S. Treasury note is at 4.02%, despite the federal funds target rate being 175 basis points lower than it was in early September 2024. Thus, interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve do not always lower the interest rates on bonds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second reason why the thesis about interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve is flawed is that the market is forward-looking. As we have just seen, the market currently expects the central bank to reduce the federal funds rate by 50 to 75 basis points this year. That expectation is already priced into bonds. Thus, if the Federal Reserve simply fulfills the market’s expectations, it is unlikely to move bond prices by very much. Therefore, any bond market profits that are likely to be made by 50 to 75 basis points of cuts have already been made.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other part of the thesis that some analysts are making in favor of bonds is that inflation is coming down and will continue to do so. However, it is unclear whether or not inflation is actually coming down. On February 20, 2026, the Bureau of Economic Analysis <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/news/2026/personal-income-and-outlays-december-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">released</a> its personal consumption expenditures index for the month of December 2025. This report showed that this index increased by 2.9% year-over-year. That is higher than in any of the past four months:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699345924413.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PCE Inflation Rate 4-Mo.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"537\" height=\"182\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699345924413.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699345924413.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699345924413.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bureau of Economic Analysis</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, that is the highest year-over-year increase in any of the past twelve months:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699349129305_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"983\" data-height=\"453\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699349129305_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PCE YoY Rate of Change 1-Yr.

The personal consumption expenditures index is generally considered to be a better indicator of the true rate of inflation than the Consumer Price Index. There are a few reasons for this, including the fact that the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index includes a broader range of goods and services consumed by individuals, and it also takes into account the price of things that are purchased by health insurance and similar products that make purchases on behalf of consumers. The Federal Reserve has historically considered the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index to be a more accurate measure of inflation, and it relies on it to make decisions about monetary policy rather than the Consumer Price Index.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, it is questionable whether or not inflation is actually coming down. The Consumer Price Index shows that it dropped in January, although it is still higher than in April 2025:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699355237284_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"978\" data-height=\"459\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/695520-17721699355237284_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"US CPI YoY Rate of Change 1-Yr.

Unless this trend changes and inflation quickly declines and stays down, then there is not much room for bond yields to decline. After all, investors still want to get a positive real return on their bonds. It is difficult to see any catalyst that could push inflation down and keep it down for an extended period of time, given the borrowing needs of the U.S. government.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, it is difficult to make a bullish case for bonds or bond funds right now. Most of the potential upside from interest rate cuts is already priced in, and bond yields cannot decline very much before they end up delivering negative real yields. As such, DSL seems somewhat unlikely to deliver much upside over the next twelve months.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Distribution Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The website for the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund states that the fund has the primary objective of providing its investors with a high level of current income. This makes a lot of sense for a bond fund. In accordance with this objective, the fund pays a monthly distribution of $0.1100 per share ($1.32 per share annually), which gives it an 11.49% yield at the current share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let us look at the fund’s most recent financial report, which is the annual report for the twelve-month period that ended on September 30, 2025, to see how well it is covering its distribution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the twelve-month period that ended on September 30, 2025, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund reported a net investment income of $118,096,979. That was not sufficient to cover the $149,393,545 that the fund paid out in distributions over the period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, the fund was not able to make up for the difference through capital gains. For the twelve-month period that ended on September 30, 2025, DSL reported net realized losses of $17,784,059, which were partially offset by $8,647,081 of net unrealized gains.

Thus, it did manage to cover its distributions over the past two years. However, we can still see that the fund had to rely on its net unrealized gains to accomplish this. That could be problematic given that bonds always pay their face value at maturity (regardless of what the fund paid to get them) and unrealized gains are not necessarily permanent. As such, investors might still want to keep a watchful eye on the fund’s finances and watch its net asset value closely.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares of the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund are currently trading at a 2.81% discount on net asset value. This is a slightly worse price than the 3.53% discount that the fund’s shares have had on average over the past month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund’s current price is, however, reasonably in line with its long-term average. Over the past five years, shares of DSL have traded at prices ranging from a 14.20% discount to a 3.00% premium on net asset value. The average price over the five-year period was a 2.07% discount on net asset value. That is a slightly worse price than the fund has today.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Fund Name</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Premium/(Discount)</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund</p></td> <td><p>(2.81%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>BrandywineGLOBAL – Global Income Opportunities Fund</p></td> <td><p>(8.57%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>MFS Multimarket Income Trust</p></td> <td><p>(16.07%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Nuveen Global High Income Fund</p></td> <td><p>(7.83%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>PIMCO Dynamic Income Opportunities Fund</p></td> <td><p>5.76%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Putnam Premier Income Trust</p></td> <td><p>(3.97%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Western Asset Global Corporate Defined Opportunity Fund</p></td> <td><p>(5.32%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>abrdn Global Income Fund</p></td> <td><p>12.41%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The median price out of this group of eight funds is a 4.65% discount, so we can see that the current price of DSL is a bit above the peer median level. However, given that this is historically one of the more expensive bond funds around and that it is not particularly expensive compared to its long-term average price, the current price appears reasonable.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expenses</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund’s annual report states that it had an expense ratio of 2.98% for the most recent fiscal year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In conclusion, the DoubleLine Income Solutions Fund is a closed-end bond fund that provides a far superior yield than that of most bond index funds. It is difficult to make a case for buying it though, given that the fund failed to cover its distribution in the most recent year and it has been suffering from falling net asset value. Furthermore, it is difficult to make a case for buying bonds in the current environment, given that interest rate cuts are already priced in, and inflation remains high enough to limit the degree to which interest rates can decline further before real rates become negative. The fund’s price appears to be reasonable compared to its historical range, however.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

Are You Serious?</h2> <p>Wow! Before I begin to discuss the thesis for investors in Block, Inc. (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XYZ\" title=\"Block, Inc.\">XYZ</a></span>), I would like to express my heartfelt sympathies to the Block employees who<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> are affected by this sweeping 40% single-day </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4558343-blocks-jack-dorsey-tells-employees-why-hes-slashing-headcount-and-what-block-is-paying\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">headcount reduction</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> that CEO Jack Dorsey has decided to initiate.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There were already reported rumors of some kind of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4548789-block-may-eliminate-up-to-10-positions\">reorganization back in early February</a>. But that reported figure was supposed to be 10%, not the 40% that we have come to know as of yesterday (February 26). So it must have baffled Block employees and investors, even though the market has reacted with palpable optimism.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm not going to go into whether the market is right or wrong to lift XYZ stock by almost 20% in the pre-market as I pen this update. It is my understanding that markets are amoral and that they react to KPIs (most of the time). And because of the potential of a markedly lower cost base due to the significant reduction in headcount, not only has <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875898-block-inc-xyz-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">guidance for XYZ improved</a> in the near term, but the upgrade is also pretty significant. With that, I think you can make sense of why the market reacted like what we saw after the earnings report and conference. CFO Amrita Ahuja has the insights for us:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>For Q1, we expect year-over-year gross profit growth of 22% to $2.8 billion. In addition to the growth momentum we're seeing, our guidance also reflects a smaller cost structure going forward. We believe the actions we're taking today will enable us to deliver faster product innovation for customers in the future while also enabling us to invest meaningfully in our business. With this change in cost structure, combined with the investments we plan to make, we are increasing our guidance for adjusted operating income in 2026 to $3.2 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 54% and 6 points of margin expansion relative to 2025. We are increasing our expectation for adjusted diluted EPS in 2026 to $3.66, also reflecting year-over-year growth of 54%. For Q1, we expect adjusted operating income of $600 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $0.67, reflecting year-over-year growth of 29% and 20%, respectively. Before wrapping up, a few additional considerations related to our guidance. Our Q1 operating income guidance includes a modest benefit from today's announcement, but we expect the organizational changes we announced today to begin to more meaningfully impact adjusted operating income in the second quarter with the full impact of our new cost structure more meaningfully improving profitability in the second half of the year. Given these timing dynamics and the pacing of investments in both risk loss and sales and marketing, we expect adjusted operating income margins to expand each quarter throughout the year from our Q1 starting point of 21%. We expect these margins to expand at a faster rate in Q3 and Q4 relative to Q2, and we expect to deliver just under 60% of our 2026 adjusted operating income guidance in the second half of the year. - <em>Block Q4 2025 earnings call.</em></p></blockquote> <p data-start=\"1137\" data-end=\"1800\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">There you go. It is not a little bit of an increase, right? We are talking about a 54% growth in adjusted EPS for 2026 and also a 54% growth in adjusted operating income, or AOI, for the same fiscal year. Note that most of the benefits will flow through to the P&amp;L in the second quarter and second half, as year-over-year growth guidance for Q1 is limited to about 20% on adjusted EPS. Hence, the market is reacting just like what we should expect the market to do. It does suggest that Block has finally moved from AI experimentation to productization successfully; otherwise, we wouldn't see it being reflected and emphasized as such by the CFO in the outlook commentary.</p> <p data-start=\"1802\" data-end=\"3330\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">And we wouldn't see that <a href=\"https://s29.q4cdn.com/628966176/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-2025-Shareholder-Letter_Block.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">Block CEO Jack Dorsey is so confident</a> that he has decided to take it upon himself to announce these far-reaching layoffs to his organization. Now you see, Jack Dorsey has always been somewhat of an engineering person, if you are familiar with his background. While he may not necessarily be the <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/newsletters/the-briefing/jack-dorsey-proves-ai-job-cut-fears-true-ellisons-win-warner?rc=3e6wgn\" rel=\"nofollow\">best manager of talent</a>, some could argue he has still been instrumental and influential in shaping narratives involving social media (he’s the co-founder of Twitter), Bitcoin (note that XYZ owns a reporting segment linked to it), and, of course, payments infrastructure.</p> <h2 data-start=\"1802\" data-end=\"3330\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Block's Two-Sided Flywheel Will Be Tested</h2> <p data-start=\"1802\" data-end=\"3330\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the latter, Block has penetrated firmly into the Gen Z consumer segment and also the SMB merchant opportunities. In other words, Block has consolidated a two-sided flywheel encompassing Cash App (consumer) and Square (merchant) in its fledgling ecosystem. Investors who have followed this company long enough before it changed its name to Block and ticker symbol to XYZ should know that back in the pandemic boom years, they also acquired Afterpay. And we all know that back then, tech companies were going after talent like nobody's business, snapping up everyone like \"hotcakes,\" as bosses were concerned whether they could hire enough people due to the implication resulting from the pandemic.</p> <p data-start=\"1802\" data-end=\"3330\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Obviously, those crazy moments are now well behind us. Employment indicators have gone tepid, even though they are not showing any distress signals right now. However, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-24/us-consumer-confidence-rises-on-stronger-views-of-economy-jobs?srnd=homepage-americas\" rel=\"nofollow\">consumer confidence</a> is still at historically low levels, despite having some respite this month based on the latest reports.</p> <p data-start=\"3332\" data-end=\"3782\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, I think there is some justification that Block could have amalgamated a pretty sizeable headcount base that may not truly reflect the current era where AI could fundamentally alter the growth curve of its earnings projections. Let's not forget that the market has not been truly convinced about its investor day goals yet. Because if the market has full confidence in those targets, then why is XYZ still &gt;80% below its pandemic-era highs when calculated from its recent bottom?</p> <p data-start=\"3784\" data-end=\"4265\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course we could point out that this situation is not unique to Block. In the fintech space, we have seen how PayPal (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PYPL\" title=\"PayPal Holdings, Inc.\">PYPL</a>) has also suffered immensely at the hands of the shareholder class. PayPal also owns a two-sided network, but it probably hasn’t executed as well as XYZ in the merchant space. I guess that's why, when it comes to e-commerce, it has not been able to make significant gains and is underperforming the market average, as <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874612-paypal-left-for-dead-but-the-buyout-narrative-changes-everything-upgrade\">I discussed in a recent PYPL update</a>.</p> <p data-start=\"4267\" data-end=\"4603\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Whereas, for Block, the current environment offers them another chance to regain the initiative and help the stock get out of its rut. The market needs more confidence, obviously beyond just headcount cuts. Nevertheless, the upgraded guidance for 2026, for now, shows that the company has a viable pathway to reaching its 2028 commitments.</p> <p data-start=\"4605\" data-end=\"4855\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">In July last year, in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802172-block-rally-not-finished-yet-do-not-bail-now\">my previous update on Block</a>, I thought that the slide in the stock could come to an end. However, this proved to be premature, as the challenges that have affected fintech companies like Block persisted through the rest of 2025.</p> <h2 data-start=\"4605\" data-end=\"4855\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Block: Growth Reacceleration In The Works</h2> <p data-start=\"4605\" data-end=\"4855\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721920203746235.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Block 2025 gross profit\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"Block 2025 gross profit\" data-source=\"Block\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721920203746235.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721920203746235.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721920203746235.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721920203746235.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\">Block 2025 gross profit <span>(Block)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p data-start=\"4605\" data-end=\"4855\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p data-start=\"4857\" data-end=\"5833\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the positive takeaway from the 2025 numbers is that the company is still fundamentally strong. It's already profitable, and it has integrated its diverse segments well, benefiting from the two-sided flywheel that I discussed earlier. This network effect has obviously gained traction even though the growth rates have slowed tremendously.</p> <p data-start=\"4857\" data-end=\"5833\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">As we can see from the above chart, Block is now no longer considered a high-growth play. There are enough profitable companies out there outside the fintech space that are growing their profits above 20%. You can find them easily in the semiconductor space or even among the suppliers to the chip designers, as they supply the picks and shovels and the plumbing to help build out the AI infrastructure. And since we are still in the earlier stages of this multi-trillion-dollar phase, I believe management could also be concerned about when they will get that re-rating opportunity that could see the valuation return to a higher level.</p> <p data-start=\"5835\" data-end=\"6504\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because it's important for us to understand that fintech companies are not your typical value or income stock in the financial sector. Value investors are not going to pay the current premium (17x forward earnings, as compared to financial media of &lt;11x) attached to XYZ even before yesterday's post-earnings spike. These investors should very much prefer more stable big banking earnings predictability, as well as the dividend income that comes with their P&amp;L, that are less susceptible to business cycle risks that could affect XYZ more significantly than the rest. After all, like I mentioned earlier, the company has a bigger exposure to the more vulnerable class in the consumer and merchant business.</p> <p data-start=\"5835\" data-end=\"6504\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-1772192171880085.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Block guidance\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"Block guidance\" data-source=\"Block\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-1772192171880085.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-1772192171880085.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-1772192171880085.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-1772192171880085.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\">Block guidance <span>(Block)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p data-start=\"5835\" data-end=\"6504\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p data-start=\"6506\" data-end=\"7032\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, I believe management must come out with something disruptive on their own to re-energize shareholders and potential growth investors to come back to its bullish narrative. And if you can put up guidance that suggests more than 50% growth in adjusted earnings, now that's something to get people’s attention, right? It certainly also got my attention, because if you look at the 2026 guidance, it suggests that gross profit growth could now be re-accelerating and laying a clearer pathway to reaching the 2028 imperatives.</p> <p data-start=\"7034\" data-end=\"7452\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's important right now is that management has a lower OpEx base to work with, even though this is predicated very much on the success of its AI initiatives. It remains to be seen whether these are indeed transformational for the company, but I guess Block is astutely leveraging the zeitgeist that has made Claude Code the dominant media narrative and headlines in the past month, and particularly so this week.</p> <p data-start=\"7454\" data-end=\"7750\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">For a stock that was valued at just under 17x forward earnings before the run-up, it is very below the S&amp;P 500’s 21.4x forward earnings. In other words, there is much for XYZ to be re-rated if it manages to use the current organizational restructuring to drive constructive earnings growth.</p> <p data-start=\"7752\" data-end=\"8160\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Jack Dorsey was clearly generous with his words, as he wanted to use the opportunity to emphasize how deeply the company has integrated AI into its workflows, suggesting that this project has been an ongoing and multi-year initiative. So the 40% headcount reduction should not be construed as something it came up with at the last minute, given the current flux that we have in fintech on the street right now.</p> <p data-start=\"8162\" data-end=\"9316\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dorsey’s commentary suggests to me that we could see an even tighter integration on its network and peer-to-peer capabilities. Therefore, it is not only going to be just the merchant side, but also the consumer side. This should drive improved operating leverage. As he explained, Block could \"personalize\" the products and services, which has the potential to improve the attach rates on its software integration, which is actually where Block really makes most of its money.</p> <p data-start=\"8162\" data-end=\"9316\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">And so they have this dual-pronged approach in circulating the consumer and merchant flywheel to deliver a higher value proposition through a \"better understanding of Block’s customers.\" I think the traction is really still very much uncertain in the current context. So I expect management to provide us more salient updates on how these AI initiatives could propel it closer to its 2028 goals. While investors have bid up the stock in view of the optimistic outlook, moving forward they will definitely want to see execution and clarity from the AI productization to be convinced that a longer time recovery could be taken as the norm and not the exception.</p> <h2 data-start=\"8162\" data-end=\"9316\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Buy Or Sell XYZ Stock?</h2> <p data-start=\"8162\" data-end=\"9316\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721923701022832.png?io=w640\" alt=\"XYZ price chart (long-term, monthly)\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-caption=\"XYZ price chart (long-term, monthly)\" data-source=\"TradingView\" width=\"640\" height=\"418\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721923701022832.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721923701022832.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721923701022832.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/51630113-17721923701022832.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption data-type=\"regular-img\"><p class=\"item-caption\">XYZ price chart (long-term, monthly) <span>(TradingView)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p data-start=\"8162\" data-end=\"9316\" class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <p data-start=\"9318\" data-end=\"10640\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Okay, I guess you can see that XYZ has been moving in a pretty predictable consolidation zone between the $45 level and the $80 level. With the pre-market prices moving the stock back up to the $65 zone, the situation has arguably stabilized, which should reduce the chances of seeing it fall back toward the February lows.</p> <p data-start=\"9318\" data-end=\"10640\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">And since the $45 level has almost been tested twice, I don't expect the stock to drop below that level. Yet I also don't find enough longer-term catalysts after this current surge as the market attempts to price in the near-term benefits from a lower cost base, attributed to the organizational restructuring.</p> <p data-start=\"9318\" data-end=\"10640\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving from here, investors will likely press management for more answers on how it intends to execute such a massive reduction in its employee count. Without that level of certainty, it's challenging to envisage how Block could attract more buyers back as the valuation normalizes closer to the S&amp;P 500 average.</p> <p data-start=\"9318\" data-end=\"10640\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, the ongoing economic uncertainties and weak consumer confidence levels could continue to weigh on its buying sentiments through the rest of 2026. And with the broad weakness in the financial sector potentially stymying efforts in elevating the bullish proposition, the coast is far from clear. This should require us to consider a larger discount to reflect these headwinds.</p> <p data-start=\"10642\" data-end=\"10669\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rating: Downgrade XYZ to Hold.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

This isn't the case with Iridium Communications (</span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IRDM\" title=\"Iridium Communications Inc.\">IRDM</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">); the firm has solid fundamentals with management that has a propensity to return value to shareholders; however, the stock has been a laggard for multiple years now, which made me label it a \"falling knife\" in my previous </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4824611-iridium-communications-good-fundamentals-but-a-fall-knife-nonetheless\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">article</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">. To give you a perspective of how disappointing the price performance has been, just take a look at the YoY performance chart of IRDM vs. peers and the S&amp;P 500. Iridium lost 22% in value, underperforming the 18% return from SPY, while ViaSat, Globalstar, and EchoStar returned 449.7%, 224.2%, and 277.6%, respectively. </span></p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721253498596656.png?io=w640\" alt=\"YoY Total returns\" width=\"629\" height=\"500\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"629\" data-height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721253498596656.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721253498596656.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721253498596656.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">YoY Total returns <span>(YCharts)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason for this major underperformance has to do with the fact that the company has historically underinvested in growth while its industry was being invaded by multiple competitors like SpaceX and AST SpaceMobile. This made investors question the durability of Iridium's dominance in offering IoT and narrowband services to government and enterprises. Investor behavior was slightly different in the last 10 years compared to the current environment. Companies that were being too conservative with their use of cash were seen as ossified and had a greater chance of being disrupted by companies that were embarking on more ambitious goals. Since 2017, IRDM has reduced its CAPEX by roughly 80%, while competitors were going in the other direction.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336971165698_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336971165698_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IRDM CAPEX vs Peers\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336971165698_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336971165698_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336971165698_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336971165698_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IRDM CAPEX vs Peers <span>(Stock Analysis)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, relative to peers, Iridium has been growing its top line at single digits, which in a way was validating to the market that the firm must have been slowly losing its pricing power in certain segments of its business, especially the broadband segment, which has been declining since 2023 as enterprises switched to using Starlink's constellation to access higher throughput and low-latency Ka and Ku bands and opted for Iridium's broadband services as backup. While growth rates are highly cyclical in this industry, IRDM hasn't been able to achieve YoY rates of more than 20%, while VSAT and GSAT would return more than 50% in a given year. In the last five years, Iridium returned a revenue CAGR of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/comparison/new/MCUyQ2lyZG0lMkNhc3RzJTJDc2F0cyUyQ2dzYXQlMkN2c2F0\">8%</a> vs. its peers ASTS, SATS, GSAT, and VSAT returning 36.39%, 51.56%, 15.58%, and 15.44%, respectively. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336734901357_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336734901357_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IRDM revenue growth vs Peers\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"360\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336734901357_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336734901357_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336734901357_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721336734901357_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IRDM revenue growth vs Peers <span>(Stock Analysis)</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result of the stock continuing to decline, Iridium now trades at an attractive valuation relative to its sector and peers. But when the stock first showed up on my screens, I was wary to hit the bid, as momentum indicators were still in the red. Hence my initial hold rating. The momentum is finally positive, and there are growth drivers like the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4869525-iridium-communications-inc-irdm-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">commercialization</a> of NTN Direct and PNT ASICs in the middle of this year that are expected to boost topline growth by $200 million in 2030. However, the short-term catalyst for significant growth will likely come from third-party enterprises that are looking to utilize Iridium's L-band spectrum asset to offer a D2D network to its end consumers, but this is still in the speculation phase, but the likelihood of such an alliance is pretty high given that management did state in the last earnings call that it will not rule out business alliances that offer incremental value to shareholders. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721264796875544.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q4 Earnings transcripts\" width=\"567\" height=\"263\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"567\" data-height=\"263\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721264796875544.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721264796875544.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721264796875544.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Q4 Earnings transcripts <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my previous article, I said Iridium had solid fundamentals, but it's a falling knife. Due to recent events, this sentiment has shifted. YTD, Iridium stock has outperformed its peers, returning 36%, while GSAT and SATS returned 3% and -1%, respectively. The scatter plot below makes a comparison between 1-year and YTD performance of a subset of stocks within the communication services sector that are close peers to Iridium. Iridium is in the second quadrant with one of the highest YTD performances, showing a mean-reversion behavior. This is also true with GSAT and SATS; they've massively outperformed peers last year, but YTD performance has disappointed. Given the B+ rating for momentum, I expect this positive momentum to continue, driven by Iridium's discounted valuation and the commercialization of NTN and PNT services, making me upgrade my initial rating from a hold to a strong buy. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721258345130308_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1276\" data-height=\"506\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721258345130308_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Momentum\" width=\"640\" height=\"254\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"254\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721258345130308_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721258345130308_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721258345130308_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721258345130308_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Momentum <span>(Analyst Chart, Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial Analysis</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FY 2025 Income Statement</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the full <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/154067302\">fiscal year</a> results, revenue increased 5% to $871.55 million. Looking at segments, the growth was led by engineering and support growing 26% to $156.96 million, followed by commercial IoT increasing 9% to $181.38 million. Growth was offset by subscriber equipment declining 11% to $81.11 million and broadband declining 10% to $50.72 million.

The growth in FCF was offset by capex increasing 43% to $100.28 million. This massive capex growth is in response to the company pausing buybacks to bolster growth through additional services. Management did state that it is not under pressure to invest in upgrading and growing its LEO constellation until 2031, freeing FCF for more dividend payouts and debt reduction. Despite FCF growing 2%, the margin still outpaced the sector median at 28% vs. 10.33%. SBC decreased 19% to $51.58 million, reflecting management's commitment to reducing stock dilution, as it stated that future compensation will be paid fully in cash, reducing stock issuance by 1%. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721267581231148_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6000\" data-height=\"4000\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721267581231148_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FY2025 Cash Flow Statement\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"427\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721267581231148_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721267581231148_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721267581231148_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-17721267581231148_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">FY2025 Cash Flow Statement <span>(Analyst chart, SEC Filling)</span></p></figcaption></figure><h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FY 2025 Balance Sheet</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Iridium's balance sheet displays management's effort to reduce debt and lower interest expenses.

While the balance sheet is still highly leveraged, the firm managed to retire debt that was maturing in the near term; most of the remaining debt matures in 2030, and given that the firm is a cash-generating machine with growth drivers ahead, I'm pretty confident the debt-to-equity ratio will get reduced to 2x as management intends. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126803122895_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"6000\" data-height=\"4000\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126803122895_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FY2025 Balance Sheet\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"427\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126803122895_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126803122895_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126803122895_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126803122895_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">FY2025 Balance Sheet <span>(Analyst chart, SEC Filling)</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Quantitative Analysis</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at the profitability factor of Iridium in relation to its peers, we can see that it has one of the highest EBITDA and FCF margins, warranting it an A- rating by the Seeking Alpha Quant system.

The trend line in the scatter plot illustrates that for a firm that trades at a price-to-cash flow of 6.20x, the fair value for the EBITDA multiple should be around 13x as opposed to the current multiple of 9.36x, implying a 39% stock upside. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126942925048_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1276\" data-height=\"506\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126942925048_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Valuation\" width=\"640\" height=\"254\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"254\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126942925048_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126942925048_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126942925048_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58361526-1772126942925048_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Valuation <span>(Analyst chart, Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, when we look at the median of its historical valuation, it sits at 16.69x.

The reason for this estimation has to do with the surging demand for surveillance services that will enable governments to track position, time, and locations of war assets like UAVs without jamming and spoofing risks, unlike with GPS. As we speak, PNT services are being used in Europe and Asia, and management stated they have realized well over $10 million in revenue and estimate realizing more than $100 million by 2030 during the Q&amp;A of the call. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are multiple execution risks associated with Iridium, the main one being that they are expected to commercialize NTN direct in the middle of this year while also expected to transition the PNT ASIC from the prototype to the commercial phase. Any faults or delays in any of these developments could result in the stock tanking, as this will reduce investors' confidence in topline growth. And also, given the fact that management has paused buyback, the cushion layer for drawdowns has been removed, leaving no protection for the downside risk. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My worries about Iridium have been lowered given the positive momentum that has built up since the start of this year. I have always been impressed by the fundamentals of the firm and management's commitment to return value to shareholders, but seeing that the stock had consistently dropped made me feel wary that we could be catching a falling knife. That is not the case anymore. The firm now has growth drivers that will definitely appeal to investors that over-index for topline growth, adding another class of investors on top of those looking for high profitability and shareholder yield. According to my model, we could see roughly 39% upside if Iridium were to trade in line with its sector on an EBITDA multiple, deserving of a strong buy rating. </p>",

Sticky inflation data and a steady, low jobless rate may complicate that forecast for a near-term cut. Markets will pay close attention to next week’s payrolls report for February, looking for new clues on where monetary policy is headed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another key variable is Kevin Warsh, the incoming Fed chair, who will take over the central bank’s leadership in May. Analysts are debating whether Warsh will tilt dovish to support President Trump’s demands for lower interest rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A complicating factor is the current nowcast for a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4873893-us-growth-slows-q4-early-q1-data-signals-rebound\" rel=\"noopener\">rebound</a> in economic growth for the first quarter. The Atlanta Fed’s <a href=\"https://www.atlantafed.org/research-and-data/data/gdpnow\" rel=\"nofollow\">GDPNow model</a>, for example, is currently estimating that GDP will rise 3.1% in the first three months of this year, up sharply from Q4’s sluggish 1.4% increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The rise of artificial intelligence as an economic input is another variable that’s muddling the outlook. “The question is how is AI going to be inflationary, and maybe the long end of the curve is sniffing all of this out,” <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bond-traders-betting-fed-rate-111333432.html\" rel=\"noopener\">said</a> Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management. “The only inflationary aspect of AI is the building out of data centers and the associated energy needs, and that is known.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If CEOs are right and growth is re-accelerating, the Treasury market is mispriced. If the bond market is right, CEO optimism is a head fake.

This ongoing regulatory uncertainty serves as a systemic drag on the market, outweighing other potential technical or on-chain improvements.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Key Crypto-Specific Catalysts </strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amid this macro turmoil, project-specific events have exacerbated the downdraft:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>Vitalik Buterin did sell 1,869 ETH for about $3.67 million over two days in late February 2026. This formed part of a larger pre-announced plan from late January, when he withdrew and allocated 16,384 ETH to support long-term Ethereum ecosystem initiatives. Although these sales were strategic and transparent, they added short-term market pressure and contributed to roughly a 5% decline in ETH's price during an already fragile period. This shows how extremely sensitive and fearful the current crypto market has become: reactions to the capital flows of key figures or institutions are often excessively amplified, gradually eroding rational market behavior in this environment.</p></li> <li><p>Bitdeer, a leading Bitcoin mining company, fully liquidated its self-mined Bitcoin treasury, selling approximately 1,133 BTC for about $62 million, reducing its holdings to zero. The move aims to generate liquidity for AI cloud services expansion and data center land acquisitions. Similarly, in early Feb 2026, Cango miner sold 4,451 BTC for roughly $305 million to bolster its balance sheet and accelerate its pivot to AI infrastructure. More and more miners are shifting toward AI and data center infrastructure, using Bitcoin sales as a key financing strategy to fuel this pivot.</p></li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Did the 10am Dump Stop Bitcoin from Hitting $150K?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since late 2024, Bitcoin has consistently experienced sharp sell-offs every trading day right around 10 a.m. Eastern Time, a pattern dubbed the “10am dump” by the crypto community.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a viral long-form X post, Justin Bechler argues that this was executed by quantitative trading firm Jane Street. As an Authorized Participant for major Bitcoin spot ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBIT\" title=\"iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF\">IBIT</a>), Jane Street has privileged access to create and redeem ETF shares directly with real Bitcoin. This allows them to arbitrage discrepancies between the ETF’s NAV and the spot market price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The author claims Jane Street leveraged this position by programmatically selling Bitcoin into the open market at 10 a.m., deliberately pushing spot prices lower to accumulate ETF shares at a discount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_202602270322347a4ddd32-6410-42f7-bf74-1728cebf6df9.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1500\" data-height=\"646\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_202602270322347a4ddd32-6410-42f7-bf74-1728cebf6df9.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Whale's Insight: Surface Weakness Masks Whale Accumulation In ETH\" width=\"1280\" height=\"551\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_202602270322347a4ddd32-6410-42f7-bf74-1728cebf6df9.jpg?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_202602270322347a4ddd32-6410-42f7-bf74-1728cebf6df9.jpg?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_202602270322347a4ddd32-6410-42f7-bf74-1728cebf6df9.jpg?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_202602270322347a4ddd32-6410-42f7-bf74-1728cebf6df9.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_202602270322347a4ddd32-6410-42f7-bf74-1728cebf6df9.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_202602270322347a4ddd32-6410-42f7-bf74-1728cebf6df9.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_202602270322347a4ddd32-6410-42f7-bf74-1728cebf6df9.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The post points to Jane Street’s Q4 2025 13F filings showing $790 million in IBIT holdings but suggests these long positions were likely fully hedged or even net short via undisclosed derivatives like put options, short futures, or collar strategies. This masked any true bearish exposure while public disclosures showed bullish holdings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The author estimates that without this daily suppression, Bitcoin’s price would already be at least $150k, far above current levels, highlighting how ETF mechanics may distort the asset’s true scarcity-driven value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notably, following a February 2026 federal lawsuit from Terraform Labs’ bankruptcy administrator accusing Jane Street of insider trading (tied to the 2022 Terra collapse), the 10am dump pattern abruptly ceased. Bitcoin then staged a strong V-shaped rebound, with the community interpreting this as legal and regulatory pressure forcing Jane Street to halt the alleged algorithm.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_20260227032235791c9113-036d-49c7-bd4c-4bd8b99126f0.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1500\" data-height=\"1510\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_20260227032235791c9113-036d-49c7-bd4c-4bd8b99126f0.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Whale's Insight: Surface Weakness Masks Whale Accumulation In ETH\" width=\"1280\" height=\"1289\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_20260227032235791c9113-036d-49c7-bd4c-4bd8b99126f0.jpg?io=w1280 1280w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_20260227032235791c9113-036d-49c7-bd4c-4bd8b99126f0.jpg?io=w1080 1080w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_20260227032235791c9113-036d-49c7-bd4c-4bd8b99126f0.jpg?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_20260227032235791c9113-036d-49c7-bd4c-4bd8b99126f0.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_20260227032235791c9113-036d-49c7-bd4c-4bd8b99126f0.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_20260227032235791c9113-036d-49c7-bd4c-4bd8b99126f0.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_20260227032235791c9113-036d-49c7-bd4c-4bd8b99126f0.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The thread exploded in popularity, sparking heated debates in crypto circles about institutional arbitrage transparency, ETF structural flaws, and Bitcoin’s suppressed price potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While some analysts counter that the pattern wasn’t consistent enough to prove systemic manipulation, and others point out that large market makers such as Jane Street have long possessed the technical ability to influence prices across many assets, though intentional manipulation is clearly illegal and not unique to crypto, the narrative has reignited scrutiny over who truly controls Bitcoin’s price discovery.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Week Ahead </strong></h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p><strong>Mar 1 </strong>Crypto Expo Europe</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mar 3</strong> US ISM Manufacturing PMI Release</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mar 5 </strong>Employment Situation for February</p></li> <li><p><strong>Mar 5 </strong>U.S. Import and Export Price Indexes for January</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next week blends crypto community activity with key US macro data.

I found that despite its recent missteps, the stock was still trading at a discount. The misstep I am referring<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to was the acquisition of Indoff in May 2023, which was dilutive in terms of operating margins and shifted the company's focus away from expanding its lucrative Private Label portfolio.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since then, GIC has continued to grow its topline better than expected, and more significantly, has expanded its gross margins. While the SD&amp;A increase has been a drag, the YOY improvement in operating margins is a pleasant surprise. While the share price has gained 21% since, I still find GIC to be decently undervalued, both on an intrinsic basis and relative to its peers. For the stock to realize its potential, the management needs to continue this momentum on the top line, keep up the expanded gross margin profile, and successfully navigate the ever-changing tariff situation. If it can successfully accomplish this, the stock still has a good runway ahead of it - getting back to, and hopefully surpassing this time, its all-time high of around <strong>$45</strong>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Investment Thesis</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global Industrial has cultivated a broad customer base over its 75-year history, ranging from small and medium-sized businesses to large enterprises like Walmart and Home Depot. Furthermore, the company has expanded its reach into the B2C segment through digital marketing efforts and continues to broaden its product portfolio and target customer segments, with recent inroads into public sector enterprises. Now, with a new CEO in place, it is re-targeting the larger strategic enterprise and governmental accounts—which tend to be more relationship-based, with higher average order size, and result in repeat customer orders. Being able to grow revenues at 4.8% in 2025 despite a 1% shrink in Q1 and in a year plagued with tariff vagaries is quite an achievement. The company seems to have begun a positive momentum streak, with 14% topline QoQ growth in Q4 and a 100 bps gross margin improvement YOY. This has translated into almost a 100 bps improvement in its operating margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the flip side, the Selling, Distribution &amp; Administrative (SD&amp;A) expenses remain elevated, even more than 2 years after the Indoff acquisition. Given the strategic shift towards “high touch” sales, I reckon the SD&amp;A will continue to be elevated, and therefore, operating margins will stabilize around 7.1%. It is important to note that GIC has managed to improve operating margins to 9% by 2022 from 5.8% in 2017.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Against this backdrop, I ran a <strong><em>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation </em></strong>analysis for GIC. I assumed next year’s topline growth will be a tad lower at 3%, given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty, and will gradually improve to the risk-free rate of 4%. Operating margins are assumed to increase over the period from 6.5% to 7.1%, driven by gross margin improvements. Historically, the company has not needed to invest much in Capex besides maintenance capital and additional working capital needs. I reckon this modus operandi will continue. Finally, the WACC for the company is 8.6%, which is lower than what I used previously, primarily driven by the recent drop in the US risk-free rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>Using these inputs, the model yields an equity value of approximately $47/share. </em></strong>This represents a substantial 40% upside from the current share price of approximately $33.5.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>FCFF Valuation Model ($ million)</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58164074-17721487331540394_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"822\" data-height=\"437\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58164074-17721487331540394_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DCF Valuation Model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58164074-17721487331540394_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58164074-17721487331540394_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58164074-17721487331540394_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58164074-17721487331540394_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's analysis</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Simulation Results</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Results from the DCF model are highly dependent on the key assumptions outlined. The key variables under management control that will have a marked impact on valuation are related to the Private label mix, Private label margins, and overall cost control of the Selling, Distribution &amp; Administrative (SD&amp;A) expenses. Monte Carlo simulations were performed on the DCF model with these inputs as variables, with their values being drawn from the distributions shown in the table below.

With GIC currently trading around $33.5, it falls around the 3<sup>rd</sup> percentile of this range, indicating it is significantly underpriced and offers a substantial margin of safety.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Relative Pricing</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To analyze how GIC trades relative to its peers, I selected a group of 23 public companies within the broader industrial distribution space. I regressed commonly used multiples against fundamental value drivers for each multiple. Based on these regression models, I calculated the predicted values of the multiples at which GIC should be trading, given its fundamentals (growth rate, margins, beta, payout ratio, ROC, etc.). I selected multiples where the regression R-squared was relatively high. As shown in the table below, GIC is currently undervalued across all four selected multiples. The valuation range derived from these relative multiples is <strong>$35 - $51</strong>. This confluence of intrinsic and relative valuation provides additional confidence in the thesis that GIC is currently trading at a discount. It should be trading close to its all-time high of around <strong>$45</strong>, which it has hit several times but has failed to break through that ceiling.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p>Multiple</p></td> <td><p>Predicted Value of Multiple</p></td> <td><p>Equity Price/ share</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>EV/Sales NTM</p></td> <td><p>1.4</p></td> <td><p><strong>$43.8</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>EV/Invested capital</p></td> <td><p>4.7</p></td> <td><p><strong>$38.1</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>EV/EBITDA NTM</p></td> <td><p>15.2</p></td> <td><p><strong>$35.1</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>P/BV</p></td> <td><p>6.24</p></td> <td><p><strong>$50.6</strong></p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Several important risk factors warrant consideration:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Continued tariff uncertainties—The tariff</strong> situation continues to evolve on an almost weekly basis. With the recent cancellation of IEEPA tariffs came the imposition of 15% tariffs under section 122. These can technically be applied for only 150 days. Hence, in another few months, we are likely to see the scenario changing again. A more significant impact from tariffs, both monetarily and due to increased uncertainty, could severely affect economic activity in North America. The industrial distribution sector would consequently suffer from reduced demand, higher landed costs of products, and increased inventory carrying costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Stalling of Private Label product proliferation—It</strong> is ironic that, though proliferation of private label portfolios is a major driver of gross margin expansion for the company, the initiative seems to have taken a back seat. The very fact that it’s not being mentioned in the prepared remarks or even in the analyst questions during the last few earnings calls is a concern. This is a unique opportunity for the company, and squandering it is not in the inventors’ best interests.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Continued poor performance of Indoff acquisition—For</strong> two years in a row, the SD&amp;A costs have increased and are now running at 28.5% of sales versus a 5-year average of 26.9% prior to the Indoff acquisition. While this may not seem like much, given the low-margin nature of the business, the impact from these 160 bps of underperformance is about 21% in intrinsic value. Even if the company can recover to the 27.5% level in the next 5 years, it would be an accretive ~$4.8 to its value.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I continue to find GIC to be trading at a substantial discount from both an intrinsic value and a relative pricing perspective. It represents a 40% upside potential from its current price of $33.5. GIC has recently (Q4 2025) repurchased 326,000 shares at an average price of $28.50, further strengthening the undervaluation thesis. It has continued on this path in Q1 2026 as well and has authorization to purchase another 1MM shares. With the current momentum from Q4 continuing, the stock has the potential to hit the $45 level again, a feat it has achieved on several occasions. There could still be further upside if management can address some of the risks outlined here.</p>",
