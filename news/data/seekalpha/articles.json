This will be <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4508501-american-water-works-essential-utilities-to-merge-in-all-stock-deal\">a huge merger</a> within the U.S. water utility space.</p> <p>I've been a long-time Essential Utilities shareholder<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> within my buy-and-hold portfolio. So, I've been taking a fresh look at WTRG stock to decide what to do with that position ahead of the potential merger.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why Some Essential Utilities Shareholders Are Displeased</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I've seen some people that seem frustrated with this deal offer. That's understandable due to the limited premium and the firms' respective dividend policies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">American Water Works is offering a roughly 10% premium to where Essential Utilities had been trading prior to the deal announcement. However, there's a catch there. Specifically, this is an all stock purchase, with American Water Works offering 0.305 shares of AWK stock per share of WTRG stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The issue here is that American Water Works stock has traded down by roughly the same amount as the stated premium, meaning that there's been no net benefit to Essential Utilities shareholders because the value of the acquiring company has decreased. Here's a chart showing this in action:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c296eeeb48ea928c926917d5c468284f.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a 10% deal premium and an 11% drop in AWK stock over the past week, any benefit from the acquisition announcement has been effectively offset.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, WTRG stock is actually trading down about 6% since the deal was announced. That's likely because the deal isn't expected to close until the beginning of 2027, so there is a time value of money component to consider as well as it relates to potential merger arbitrage trades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second factor that has irritated some Essential Utilities investors is that the dividend from AWK stock is significantly lower than the dividend from WTRG stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, American Water Works has had a lower dividend yield than Essential Utilities for virtually all of the past decade, with the gap widening notably more recently:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3412876d3fb22872e6bc9820c3fa21ba.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of this writing, WTRG stock is offering a 3.36% dividend yield compared to AWK stock's 2.45% yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, for investors that let their WTRG stock convert into AWK shares once the deal closes, this amounts to a sort of backdoor dividend cut. To put specific numbers to it, Essential Utilities currently pays out $1.37 per share in annual dividends. At the proposed conversion rate of 0.305 shares of American Water Works per Essential Utilities share, investors would receive $1.01 per share in annual dividends from the 0.305 shares of AWK stock that they will be given as merger consideration. That's a meaningful reduction in dividend income.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why The Deal Makes Sense</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's not all bad news, as far as this merger goes, however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The clear positive is that the combined company will be far and away the largest privately-run water utility in the United States. American Water Works already serves millions of people across 14 states, with that set to jump to 17 states once this deal closes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's notable that there are no other U.S. publicly-traded water utilities with a market cap of more than $3 billion. American Water Works' market cap is around $26 billion with Essential Utilities coming in second at $11 billion. The next biggest is <strong>American States Water</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AWR\" title=\"American States Water Company\">AWR</a>) at $2.8 billion. As such, the combined firm will be far and away the biggest player in this space once the deal closes, with a likely market cap in the $35-$40 billion range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even prior to announcing this deal, American Water Works was already guiding that it would spend roughly $18 billion on CAPEX between 2025 and 2029. That's a large number, all things considered, and now that figure should further increase as the company takes on the maintenance, repairs, and expansion of Essential Utilities' water infrastructure as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe the company's combined size will make it far and away the most well-known and liquid investment vehicle for the U.S. water utility sector. The practical consequence is that the combined firm should have a lower cost of capital than its peers and be able to sell bonds at attractive interest rates thanks to its scale and platform advantage. It will also be a leading bidder when privately held water systems come up for public sale. With its low cost of capital and national-scale footprint, it is a logical acquirer to keep rolling up smaller water systems around the country.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, I would note that American Water Works has grown earnings per share more quickly than Essential Utilities over the past decade. Essential Utilities got a boost from its 2020 acquisition of <strong>Peoples Natural Gas</strong>, but aside from that, American Water Works has generally had a more favorable growth profile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That is to say that while investors are making a sacrifice in terms of the starting dividend yield today in swapping WTRG shares for American Water Works, this could be offset with a higher earnings per share growth rate. And, ultimately, stronger EPS growth should lead to solid annual dividend increases as well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">WTRG Stock Verdict</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I understand why some investors are not pleased with this deal. As a longtime Essential Utilities shareholder myself, I'm not particularly thrilled with the takeover price or premium being offered here. I think WTRG stock should be worth more than $40 per share in a takeover.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, we are getting paid via American Water Works shares, and AWK stock has been basically flat since 2019, which is a major deviation from its usual longer-term trend:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_5c7118e72e86ac70fccb6f1fafb8e416.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, American Water Works revenues and earnings per share have continued to grow at a healthy clip. This continues now, with American Water Works' recent Q3 earnings report showing <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4510758-american-water-works-gaap-eps-of-1_94-beats-by-0_05-revenue-of-1_45b-beats-by-120m\">9.8% year-over-year revenue growth</a> and a healthy EPS beat. The Essential Utilities acquisition should also aid that growth rate going forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this to say that AWK stock is also trading at a fairly low valuation now compared to its past history. The water utility industry as a whole is dealing with depressed valuations. While I was expecting significant upside in WTRG stock going forward, I see substantial room for AWK stock to trade higher as well once sentiment improves.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, as interest rates drop, we may see investors flood back into dividend stocks and defensive risk-off type assets, especially if a recession occurs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Putting these factors together, it's fair to say that I don't love this deal. But I can see the strategic rationale. I certainly get the appeal of having a larger scale business with a lower cost of funding operations, especially as American Water Works is in a significant investment cycle right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At one point, AWK stock had traded up to more than 40x trailing earnings and close to 25x EV/EBITDA. That valuation was hard to justify. But shares have cooled off dramatically since then, and this looks like a reasonably attractive entry point:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_478a79826cafb242005015524bd72eb6.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, I plan to hold my WTRG shares up through the deal and let them convert into shares of American Water Works.

Capstone has recently <a href=\"https://capstonecopper.com/news/capstone-copper-announces-up-to-360-million-investment-from-orion-for-25-interest-in-santo-domingo/\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> the partnership with Orion Resource Partners, which has acquired 25% of that project for up to $360M. While Orion is certainly a competent partner for this project, and Capstone needed a partner here not to overextend its balance sheet, the sales price was on the low side.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">$360M is about 21% of the net present value of Santo Domingo using the latest feasibility study of this project, where conservative metal prices were used. The copper price was $4.10/lb and the gold price was $1,800/oz in that feasibility study. There is a buyback option in this deal following commercial production, which likely explains the lower sales price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have covered Capstone quarterly over the last couple of years, and my prior articles can be found <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/author/bang-for-the-buck/analysis?ticker=CS%3ACA\">here</a>. Today's article will focus on the Q3 2025 result that was released yesterday after the close, and the company also hosted a conference call yesterday, which can be found <a href=\"https://capstonecopper.com/investors/events-and-presentations/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock price performance of Capstone sold off substantially in April of this year, which happened to many copper miners, but the drawdown for Capstone was more pronounced. This caused me to add the stock to my portfolio in the C$6-8 range earlier this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capstone has recovered substantially from the lows and is up 37% in U.S. dollar terms this year. Much of the recovery is likely due to the strong copper price, where the COMEX copper price is back above $5/lb and the LME Copper price is not far behind, just below $5/lb. The <a href=\"https://capstonecopper.com/news/capstone-copper-announces-sanctioning-of-mantoverde-optimized-project/\" rel=\"nofollow\">sanctioning</a> of the Mantoverde Optimized project in August of this year has likely been a tailwind as well.

The production is set to grow both in the near term and longer term, while the operating costs will decrease gradually. That is a very attractive combination, especially in the current environment where copper prices are around $5/lb.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"903\" data-height=\"482\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 7 - Source: Koyfin\" width=\"640\" height=\"342\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/48701869-17619039502413957_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure 7 - Source: Koyfin</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock price performance for Capstone has been strong from the lows earlier this year, and it has been relatively good in 2025 overall. However, with a higher copper price and higher production expected from Mantoverde Optimized in the next couple of years, the valuation does not feel excessive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The EV to 2026 &amp; 2027 EBITDA is around 5-6, and I do think those EBITDA estimates will be somewhat conservative if the current copper price holds going forward. So, while the risk-reward has worsened some following the recent rally, I still rate Capstone Copper as a buy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There aren't that many copper mining companies with good operating histories and jurisdictions trading at this price. Given that Capstone has plenty of reserves and likely further growth potential from the existing assets, there is still a lot to look forward to for Capstone.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Economic weakness or a strong dollar that might impact the copper price are probably the main risks to be aware of, even if the good balance sheet and lower cost operation make Capstone relatively resilient over time. Stable production at the 4 operating mines will be important over the next few years as well, when the company is set to fund the construction of Santo Domingo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1246\" data-height=\"620\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Figure 8 - Source: Capstone Copper Presentation\" width=\"640\" height=\"318\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/48701869-17615841167458174_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure 8 - Source: Capstone Copper Presentation</p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

This is where I end up looking at things much differently, because I read through the entire earnings report and listen to the earnings call before forming an opinion. Shares of META fell as low as $650.25 as the headline news made the financial community question the CapEx spend and make references to the Metaverse. It wasn’t possible for anyone to go through the data while the sell-off was happening considering the conference call hadn’t happened nor is it possible to read a press release and the financial statements in a millisecond. The main point that the algo’s and traders didn’t calculate in their decisions to sell is that the </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285165-meta-reports-third-quarter-2025-results\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285165-meta-reports-third-quarter-2025-results\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">EPS miss</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> was because of a $18.95 billion tax expense which increased more than $16.5 billion QoQ. They also didn’t see that despite increasing the CapEx spend in Q3 by more than $3 billion to $19.85 billion, their cash generated from operations increased by more than $4 billion QoQ to $29.99 billion. I believe that the sell-off is creating an opportunity for long-term investors and while things could be volatile for some time I believe META will be one of the companies leading the market higher in 2026.</span></p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"889\" data-height=\"309\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Meta\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"222\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237142339_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Following up on my previous article about META</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in August I wrote an article about META after they reported Q2 earnings (can be read here). Since then shares of META have declined by -8.65% while the S&amp;P 500 has increased by 7.52%. I had discussed how META delivered a blowout Q2 which was driven by AI-fueled ad growth and unmatched user engagement as they crushed revenue and EPS estimates. I envisioned a long growth runway as Meta continued to leverage AI, wearables, and its massive user base to unlock new revenue streams and profitability. I felt that the market was underestimating Meta’s AI wearables and future earnings potential as I have learned not to discount Mark Zuckerbergs vision. I am following up with a new article to discuss why I think the market is wrong on META and how this will ultimately turn into an opportunity for long-term investors.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"873\" data-height=\"248\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Meta\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"182\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237978618_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>What the investment didn’t have time to see as they were fixated on the large EPS miss</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The whole point of quarterly earnings reports is to inform the market and more importantly the shareholders about the progress that is being made within a company. People trading around headlines without caring about the substance within the earnings report is short term capital and that doesn’t matter to me. On the top-line <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285165-meta-reports-third-quarter-2025-results\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285165-meta-reports-third-quarter-2025-results\" target=\"_blank\">META</a> beat revenue estimates by $1.83 billion as they generated $51.24 billion throughout Q3. The reason why everyone sold the news was because META missed on EPS by -$5.66 and generated $1.05 of EPS. If people actually waited until the earnings call was over they would have learned that EPS was down because of a onetime noncash reduction in deferred tax assets that META no longer anticipates using under the new U.S. tax law. Their tax rate would have been 14% if it wasn’t for this charge, instead it was 87%. This is where the market can become shortsighted and created opportunities for long-term investors. Later in the earnings call Susan Li (META CFO) discussed that the transition to the new U.S. tax law may have resulted in an accounting charge in Q3 but they are expecting to recognize significant cash tax savings for the remainder of 2025 and future years going forward. In my opinion this is a horrible reason to dump META as the short term money is more interested in immediate gratification rather than what will ultimately benefit the company going forward.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1432\" data-height=\"559\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"META Cash from Ops\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"250\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626238689632_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Steven Fiorillo, Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is one of the biggest aspects that was overlooked and why I prefer to look at the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META/cash-flow-statement\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META/cash-flow-statement\" target=\"_blank\">cash flow statement</a> over the income statement in many scenarios. I care more about the cash that META is generating from operations and what they are doing with the cash rather than worrying about a one-time tax charge. The reality is that META has continued to increase their CapEx, but their cash from operations continues to expand. META has generated $107.57 billion in cash from operations in the TTM which is an increase of 17.79% YoY ($16.25 billion). The bottom line is that in order for META to increase their revenue they need to reinvest in their buisness. Despite CapEx increasing by 65.15% YoY to $61.53 billion META is still generating $44.23 billion in free cash flow (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCF\" title=\"First Commonwealth Financial Corporation\">FCF</a>). The other aspect that I believe was overlooked was the actual metrics from Q3. META’s cash from operations increased by $4.44 billion (17.36%) QoQ while their CapEx increase by $3.31 billion (20.03%). META allocated 20.03% more toward CapEx but their quarterly FCF actually increased to $10.15 billion (12.47%) QoQ. So what are people really mad at? I believe that people are getting frantic that the days of spending frivolously on the Metaverse are back but I have a news flash for those investors. This time it’s the entire segment of big tech and not just META. This is the way of the future and to get there these companies need to make massive investments and they are funding it through profitability.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1386\" data-height=\"608\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q3 Deck\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"281\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237929764_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>META</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside of the crazy interpretation of why META actually missed, I felt this was another strong quarter. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285165-meta-reports-third-quarter-2025-results\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285165-meta-reports-third-quarter-2025-results\" target=\"_blank\">META</a> grew their revenue 26% YoY to $51.24 billion while increasing their gross profit by 26.66% ($8.82 billion) to $42.04 billion. META’s income from operations increased 18% YoY to $20.54 billion. It’s crazy that people wanted to sell off a company that has a 82.03% gross profit margin and is operating at a 40.01% margin. The buisness is humming as the family of apps revenue generated $50.77 billion while Reality Labs revenue increased 74% YoY to $470 million. META was in a position to repurchase $3.16 billion of Calls A shares while paying out $1.33 billion in dividends during Q3. I think a big factor to keep in mind is that their net income would have increased by $15.93 billion to $18.64 billion, compared to the reported net income of $2.71 billion. I think everyone should keep in mind that there were 3.54 billion family daily active people using their products which was an increase of 8% YoY while the ad impressions delivered across their family of apps increased by 14%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>There is a lot to be excited about as META continues to position themselves for the future</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">META continues to position itself for the future by aggressively investing in A.I. which could end up ushering in a new windfall of revenue. Meta is focused on establishing itself as the leading frontier A.I. lab and building personal superintelligence that everyone can utilize. Through META’s superintelligence offerings they are focused on delivering A.I. experiences and computing devices that impact the users that utilize their products. META also continues to lead the marketplace with A.I. glasses as they continue to develop next generation of models and products. META recently announced their 2025 line of Meta Ray-Ban display glasses at Connect which feature a high-resolution display and new AI capabilities. META believes that these endeavors with the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta products will become very profitable products that will be accretive to the bottom line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">META is in a position to leverage it’s A.I. capabilities to enhance its highly profitable family of apps segment to unlock new revenue streams. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835033-meta-platforms-inc-meta-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835033-meta-platforms-inc-meta-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">META</a> is expecting to advance its recommendation systems across several avenues through 2026. This would include surface content that caters to diverse user interests on Instagram while progressing on longer-term ranking innovations in 2026 as they create foundational ranking models and developing new model innovations to produce more relevant recommendations. Reels has grown into an annual run-rate business that exceeds $50 billion as the overall time spent on Facebook and Instagram grew double digits year-over-year in Q3 which was driven by video. The advertising revenue from advertisers using end-to-end automated solutions such as Advantage+ lead campaigns has reached $60 billion. META continues to refine ad supply across its to deliver better and more relevant ads. META continues to see a lot of growth in business messaging which grew 60% YoY and they are opening business AIs to businesses across messaging platforms to help scale conversations and improve sales.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"999\" data-height=\"214\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"META EPS\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"137\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237782843_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Steven Fiorillo, Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The haircut that META took has made it the cheapest stock in big-tech on a forward earnings basis. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META/earnings/estimates\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META/earnings/estimates\" target=\"_blank\">META</a> is now expected to generate $27.05 in EPS during 2025 and $33.62 in 2027 which is an increase of $6.56 or 24.25% over the next 2-years. META is now the only company in the Magnificent Seven which is trading under 20 times 2027 earnings. The one-time tax expense that META just incurred is nothing more than a one-time expense and this isn’t changing the forward EPS outlook in the analyst projections. This makes me bullish on the long-term potential from the current valuation META is getting and I think this will be looked at as a buying opportunity a year from now.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks to investing in META</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I am bullish on META after the sell-off there are several risk factors to consider. Everyone should do their own due diligence as my speculations could be incorrect. Over the past 2-years META has generated $197.33 billion in income operating income from it’s family of apps and generated -$39.29 billion in operating income from Reality Labs. When these are netted out META has still generated $158.04 billion in income from operations over the past 2-years. Part of the reason why META was selling off is because a segment of the investing community is worried that META is gong to continue to increase their spend on CapEX and A.I. won’t be there profit center that META envisions it will and it will look much more like Reality Labs. The A.I. landscape could also take much longer for META to monetize compared to the amount of capital their allocating toward it and this could negatively impact earnings. There is a lot for investors to consider so please do your due diligence before starting a position in META.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1283\" data-height=\"194\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Q3 Deck\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"97\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/12629971-17618626237688522_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Meta Platforms</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that the sell-off was unwarranted and that META got caught in the cross-fire between stop-losses and algos trading. The reality is that META had a one-time $18.95 billion tax expense that caused them to produce a major miss on EPS. META got caught in a downtrend immediately without anyone getting a chance to read through earnings or listen to the call. META’s cash generated from operations increased by more than $4 billion QoQ to $29.99 billion which outpaced the $3 billion that CapEx increased by. META is expecting that they will generate between $56-59 billion of revenue in Q4 and I am expecting that their EPS will be back to normal as their CFO said that the new tax law would create a tailwind for earnings going forward. I believe that META is trading at a strong valuation at less than 20 times 2027 earnings and that we will look back on this period as a buying opportunity rather than the current picture that is being painted of the sky is falling.</p>",

But the nowcast suggests that there was a fair amount of growth momentum in the previous quarter to keep recession risk low.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The partially updated <a href=\"https://www.dallasfed.org/research/wei\" rel=\"noopener\">Weekly Economic Index</a> (WEI), published by the Dallas Fed, suggests as much. WEI edged down to a 2.0% pace for the week through Oct. 25, an estimate that equates with a four-quarter GDP growth that’s slightly below the 2.1% pace reported for Q2. The report suggests that the economic trend is holding steady. But since some of WEI inputs – weekly jobless claims, for instance – aren’t updating, the latest estimate may be misleading.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Optimists can also point to the Atlanta Fed’s <a href=\"https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow\" rel=\"noopener\">GDPNow model</a>, which is currently estimating a strong 3.9% for Q3 economic activity (as of Oct. 27) – well above the median estimate in the chart above and slightly faster than the Q2 advance. But here, too, the updates should be viewed with a non-trivial degree of skepticism due to the missing data for some of the model’s inputs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The government shutdown is costing the economy about $7 billion per month, according to a <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-10/61823-Shutdown.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">new report</a> by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). That’s a rounding error for a $30 trillion economy, but it’s still another headwind at a time when signs of a labor market downshift have been persuading the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This much is clear: the longer the shutdown lasts, the stronger the headwind. Meantime, it’s still reasonable to guesstimate that economic activity grew at a moderate pace in Q3. The outlook for Q4, by contrast, is far more uncertain from the perspective of developing a reasonably accurate nowcast. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.capitalspectator.com/us-economy-probably-grew-at-solid-pace-in-q3/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

This is likely due to a combination of low growth rates (typical of a large company) and what is likely an average valuation for the industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But the price-earnings ratio shown above is well below the average for the market. That would imply that even if the valuation is average as the quant system shows, there could be more stock price progress made as long as the turnaround continues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now with that quant system rating, this may not be the most favorable time for stock price appreciation. After all, the market is looking towards a recession with the implication of weak commodity prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But that is just the time to consider an integrated major. This is the type of company that will lead any industry recovery. Because of the quant system rating, the stock price (in the judgement of the quant system) has a fair chance of going down before it goes up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But given the low visibility of the industry and commodity prices in general, it may be wise to consider dollar cost averaging rather than going \"all-in\" at once.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability, which happens to be my favorite, is rated excellent. Revisions and Momentum are likely keeping the stock price from following much of the industry. Management announced some more portfolio moves to adjust profitability. Each move itself may not be all that material to the latest results. But if management keeps \"tweaking\" the portfolio correctly, then over time a lot of losers will be gone before they can hurt results.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Major Project Pipeline</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like most majors, this company has a long list of upcoming major projects that will likely replace some things that were sold or shut down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2173\" data-height=\"1205\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shell Corporation List Of Material Projects Coming Online In The Near Future\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1102834-17618797901097786_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shell Corporation List Of Material Projects Coming Online In The Near Future <span>(Shell Corporate Presentation Third Quarter 2025)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.shell.com/investors/results-and-reporting/quarterly-results/_jcr_content/root/main/section/simple_copy/promo_1962010312_cop/links/item3.stream/1761789807852/d5fdd917d2b521125c2a10067399225077314fb2/q3-2025-slides.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Since Shell has moved</a> to England (as the last article noted), the company has been justifying that move by refocusing the business on its main oil and gas roots.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the company does venture into \"green\" projects, then those projects have to meet the same profit criteria as the main line of business.

Earnings are still lower this fiscal year than last year. But Mr. Market is always concerned with what is being done recently. A strong quarter can often overcome the reality of the fiscal year results.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Debt Issue</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a side issue the net debt figure also declined in the latest quarterly report. The debt is still above the previous fiscal year. But that decline may well relieve some investors who were worried about climbing debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Understand that the debt was well within \"safe\" territory. The company could likely afford more debt and still be investment grade. However, for those of us who remember back in the late 1970s and early 1980s about Exxon Mobil Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>) having a debt issue that went from next to nothing to a whole $4 billion, there will always be those investors that worry about rising debt, no matter how safe the debt level is. There are enough of them to significantly affect market valuations of at least some stocks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What any investor needs to understand is that there is a world of difference between rising investment-grade debt levels and non-investment-grade debt that sends the debt ratio \"off the charts\". The reason is that part of the evaluation that leads to an investment-grade rating is that the management will deal with debt issues on a prompt basis (compared to companies with below-investment-grade ratings). This is a general rule and not company-specific. But it does mean that rising investment-grade debt levels are usually not a factor to worry about.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As the website noted, Shell<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511031-shell-misses-top-line-and-bottom-line-estimates-initiates-q4-outlook\"> beat the consensus</a>. Some of that beat was likely due to the idea of Shell in the past rather than the progress being made by the refocusing effort. Many times, the consensus is based on the history of the company. But this company is demonstrating that it does not intend to follow that history. Instead, it intends to improve upon that history.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That makes this idea a strong buy for buy-and-hold investors. This is a growth and income story that has an additional boost from the ongoing turnaround effort. A diversified company like this with a relatively high debt rating is considered below average risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But despite the stock price appreciation, the price-earnings ratio is still low during a period of weak commodity prices. To me, this is nothing close to a cyclical top. Instead, weak commodity prices imply a bottom at some point in the future. Generally, cyclical stocks look very expensive at cyclical bottoms due to a lack of earnings. That could mean there is far more long-term upside potential than the market gives this stock credit for.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current bargaining that is resulting in threats of trade wars and tariffs needs to be replaced with something constructive and permanent. If the political uncertainty caused by this bargaining continues, then the much-feared recession can well become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Business tends to \"hunker down\" and pull back during times of uncertainty. The latest <a href=\"https://www.dallasfed.org/research/surveys/des/2025/2503\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dallas Fed Report</a> confirms that trend with a worse 2026 on the way.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The uncertainty could make for lower-than-expected commodity prices that are sustained for longer than expected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, a diversified company like this one will come through such a period in better shape than many in the industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk is whether or not the stock simplification and the accompanying move to England will pay off in the long run. There are clearly some short-term benefits from the move. But the situation can change to make the move unexpectedly unfavorable or at least not worth the effort.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Taking a step back and evaluating the overall market: the Pandemic inflation surge has passed, enabling the Fed to cut interest rates further this year – which is historically a positive for equity markets; earnings have proven to be resilient and continue to broaden out beyond the Magnificent 7; and secular forces, such as productivity gains from generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI), continue to provide markets an additional tailwind.</li> <li>As we look ahead, innovation is flourishing in many areas of the US economy, and we are continuing to find quality companies across the market cap spectrum in these favored areas. These areas include, but are not limited to, pioneering Gen AI companies in semiconductors and software, as well as industrial companies enabling datacenter expansion and power infrastructure to support it. We are excited about AI’s role in the emerging defense and space technology sector, as a historically low growth area sees an inflection in autonomous software and hardware systems. This positive inflection is also benefiting areas such as cloud, e-commerce, mobility, search, and social networks, as well as non-technology sectors such as Communication Services, Consumer, and Health Care.</li> <li>That said, there are several countervailing factors still in play, such as policy uncertainty. Therefore, we believe security selection is more important than ever as high-quality businesses with strong business models and exceptional management teams should be better equipped to pass through tariffs, adjust supply chains, and find productivity gains from Gen AI tools.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>TOP 10 ACTIVE OVERWEIGHT POSITIONS</strong></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Company</strong></p></td> <td> <p><strong>Fund Weight</strong></p> <p><strong>(%)</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Index Weight</strong></p> <p><strong>(%)</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Active Weight</strong></p> <p><strong>(%)</strong></p> </td> <td> <p><strong>Market Cap</strong></p> <p><strong>($B)</strong></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>AppLovin Corp.</p></td> <td><p>3.4</p></td> <td><p>0.5</p></td> <td><p>+2.9</p></td> <td><p>219.1</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Arista Networks, Inc.

I had a HOLD rating on the name.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the article was published, the stock hit my then price target of $542 before tumbling, registering an overall decline of 1.30%, compared with a gain of 8.21% for the S&amp;P 500 during the same period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MSFT announced its Q1 results yesterday and despite a strong quarter, the stock still slipped. In this article, I analyse the Q1 numbers and the overall report in detail to identify what factors could have led to the post-earnings selloff. Moreover, MSFT went into the earnings release with the stock near all-time highs. Therefore, I also analyse the company’s valuation using a quantitative model to see if it was a factor behind the selloff.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>A Snapshot of Q1 Earnings Report </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MSFT started the new fiscal year strongly, comfortably beating both the top- and bottom-line estimates. More specifically, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285087-microsoft-cloud-and-ai-strength-drives-first-quarter-results\">Q1 revenues came in at $77.67 billion</a>, up 17% y/y on a constant currency basis and beating analyst estimates by $2.28 billion. Diluted EPS came in at $4.13, up 21% y/y on a constant currency basis, and comfortably beating analyst estimates by $0.47. Operating margins were strong, coming in at 49%, which translates to an expansion of 200 bps (or 2%) y/y and an expansion of 410 bps (or 4.1%) sequentially.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The guidance from the company was also strong, with Q2 revenues expected to be in the range between $79.5 billion and $80.6 billion and operating margins expected to be flat on a y/y basis and down sequentially, <em>“<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835092-microsoft-corporation-msft-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">aligned with historic seasonality</a>.” </em>Capital expenditures, a metric that investors keenly watch out for, when it comes to companies such as MSFT, are now projected to not only grow sequentially but also are expected to have a higher growth rate in FY26 relative to FY25.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Azure’s Strength &amp; Massive Bookings Jump Justifies Further Capex Spend</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MSFT’s stock, at the time of writing, is down 2.2%, and it is hard for me to identify the precise catalyst behind the sell-off. It could be that the stock was at an all-time high going into the earnings, or it could be because of the increasing capex spending that the company announced at the time of reporting Q2 results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If it’s the latter that’s driving the sell-off, then the reaction, in my view, is certainly overdone. This is because if one looks at the overall performance of the company as well as the underlying demand that continues to outpace supply, then I don’t see any option in front of the company other than to spend more.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Take Azure, for instance. The segment came into the quarter with a lot of momentum and has exited the quarter with even more momentum, as it delivered a 40% y/y growth. And while on a sequential basis, the growth has only marginally ticked up from 39%, this time last year, Azure’s revenue growth stood at 33%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, the demand for Azure continues to remain strong, as evidenced by a massive jump in the commercial bookings, which increased 111% in constant currency in Q1. The growth does not account for the additional $250 billion Azure commitments from OpenAI that was announced as part of the ChatGPT-parent’s restructuring plans, which suggests that the growth is likely to continue. Furthermore, as further evidence of how substantial the demand for Azure is, MSFT announced that its commercial remaining performance obligations reached $392 billion, which translates to a growth of 51% y/y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1447\" data-height=\"736\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A chart showing the y/y revenue growth of MSFT's Commercial RPOs\" width=\"640\" height=\"326\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-17618490127514436_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>MSFT Press Releases</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As evidenced by the above chart, this is the highest RPO growth in the last five quarters and given that the growth stood at 21% this time last year, it reflects the significant contribution that AI has played both with respect to Azure and with respect to Microsoft 365. What is even more impressive, to me, is that the weighted average duration has remained stable, despite the huge growth, at 2 years. It was also notable that management, during the earnings call, mentioned that there was sufficient breadth in the demand (numerous products, customers of all sizes) since this mitigates some of the concentration risk that the company has, with OpenAI as one of its largest customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the rapid growth seen in bookings and given that the company is generating a substantial ROI on its capex, I don’t see any reason for the company to not spend more on capital expenditures and mitigate the capacity constraints. The company has been spending while maintaining strong margins and strong growth, and with such high demand, I don’t think this time’s going to be any different. This is primarily why I believe that the negative stock reaction, post earnings release, is overdone if capex spend is the catalyst.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is not to say that it was a perfect quarter from MSFT. For instance, MSFT reported a $3.1 billion loss this quarter compared to a $523 million loss during the same period last year. This is a substantial amount, and when asked about it during the earnings call, CFO Amy Hood confirmed that it was indeed the case, which is a substantial figure in my opinion. Ms. Hood also highlighted in her prepared remarks that going forward, outlook for other income and expense will exclude “<em>any impact from our investments in OpenAI,”</em> due to the “<em>ongoing nature of our partnership resulting in increased volatility.”</em> This is not exactly reassuring to investors, at least in near-to-medium term, especially with MSFT boosting their capex spending. This could be one of the reasons why the stock is down post-earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, Azure’s growth in Q2 is projected to slide down to 37% due to capacity constraints, which could have also triggered a knee-jerk reaction. Finally, while the company’s search business has shown accelerated growth in recent quarters, the growth rate may be stalling, or even declining, as shown below. While search is a small part of the company’s business, MSFT’s AI moves were expected to keep the segment’s growth momentum going.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1026\" data-height=\"460\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A chart showing the y/y growth in MSFT's Search &amp; News Business\" width=\"640\" height=\"287\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48460862-1761849012622366_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>MSFT Q1FY26 Earnings Call Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, it was a strong quarter from MSFT. The announcement of an increase in capex spending in FY26 seems to have not gone down well with the market. However, given that the company’s core segments that rely on these investments are generating substantial growth, and with demand continuing to outpace supply, I don’t see a reason why the company should slow down its spending. Moreover, it has the cash to spend as well as return excess capital to shareholders, so I don’t see a problem in this move by MSFT.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Valuation</strong></h2> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <td><p>Forward P/E Multiple Approach</p></td> <td> </td> </tr></thead> <tr class=\"bg-y\"> <td><p>Price Target</p></td> <td><p>$558.00</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Projected Forward P/E Multiple</p></td> <td><p>34.85x</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Projected EPS in the next twelve months</p></td> <td><p>$16.01</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sources: <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT/valuation/metrics\">Seeking Alpha</a> and Author’s Chosen Model (MS-ARIMA)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I deployed a Markov-Switching Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (MS-ARIMA) model to forecast MSFT’s EPS for the rest of FY26. MS-ARIMA is a regime-switching time-series model that addresses structural breaks, unlike traditional ARIMA models. MSFT is a company that has regularly gone through regime changes, with the AI revolution being the latest switch and therefore, MS-ARIMA is an appropriate model to predict MSFT’s future EPS. More information on the model can be found <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1912559\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Data on MSFT’s EPS was obtained from <a href=\"https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Financial Modelling Prep</a>. EPS for the last twelve quarters were selected to ensure that there was a fine balance between recency and stability. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions were then deployed on the 12-quarter window. The model was validated through out-of-sample testing on the last three quarters. The out-of-sample testing resulted in the following model metrics:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <td><p>Metric</p></td> <td><p>MS-ARIMA</p></td> <td><p>Notes</p></td> </tr></thead> <tr> <td><p>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</p></td> <td><p>0.252</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)</p></td> <td><p>0.286</p></td> <td><p>Values close to MAE suggest that there are no extreme outliers in both models.</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)</p></td> <td><p>6.68%</p></td> <td><p>MAPE values under 10% shows that the model is very good for forecasting. The directional accuracy of the model is 100%, which supports the model accuracy.</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other forecasting models such as Prophet and Random Forests were also deployed, but the MS-ARIMA had the lowest errors compared to these models, which further validated its selection.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The MS-ARIMA model was then used to forecast the EPS of the next three quarters of FY26, and the results are shown below:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <td><p>Quarter-End</p></td> <td><p>Projected EPS</p></td> </tr></thead> <tr> <td><p>Q2 FY26</p></td> <td><p>$3.84</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q3 FY26</p></td> <td><p>$3.96</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q4 FY26</p></td> <td><p>$4.08</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The total EPS for FY26 would be $16.01. According to Seeking Alpha, MSFT currently trades at a forward P/E 34.85x. At this multiple and with a projected FY26 of $16.01, my price target for MSFT is $558, which represents about 6% upside from current levels. The limited upside is unsurprising, given that the stock was trading at all-time highs prior to earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a momentum perspective, MSFT’s momentum has weakened in the last three months, as evidenced by the C+ grade on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT/momentum/performance\">Seeking Alpha’s momentum scale</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taking these together, the current levels are not attractive to initiate a position based on my analysis. As such, I am maintaining my HOLD rating. Having said that, any major pullback in the name warrants a buying opportunity in my view. Finally, I don’t see any reason for existing investors to exit their positions at current levels given the strong tailwinds that the company has.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MSFT had a strong start to the year, with a beat on both the top- and bottom-lines. The company further justified its massive capex spending, as evidenced by the strong growth seen in Azure as well as the exponential growth seen in its commercial bookings. Operating margins were also very strong.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Post the earnings release, despite delivering a strong quarter, the stock fell, which I believe could be either due to the significant jump in OpenAI-related losses, or the projected deceleration in Azure in Q2 due to capacity constraints. An alternative to these two causes would be valuation, which my analysis suggests is the case. MSFT went into the earnings near all-time highs, so any negative news was bound to get punished. While my rating on the stock is HOLD, it’s on a pure valuation basis and not due to the fundamentals of the business. Any major pullback would be a buying opportunity in my view. Given the negative sentiment I am currently seeing in the market because of the irrational fear for capex spending, I believe such opportunities should be around the corner.</p>",

The European Central Bank calls this ‘the good<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> place’ that it's currently in, illustrating that boring times are the best times for central bankers. It made yesterday’s decision to hold rates quite straightforward, and today’s numbers emphasise that this was probably the right call. Eurozone inflation has moved within 0.2ppt of the 2% target since March, and we don’t expect it to deviate much for the foreseeable future.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, at the ECB press conference yesterday, President Christine Lagarde emphasised the concern around services inflation being persistently too high to balance out downside risks to inflation. Today’s data actually showed a further acceleration in services inflation, from 3.2 to 3.4%. The focus has been a bit more on downside risks to the inflation outlook in recent weeks, which could well push the inflation outlook lower. Today’s data stresses that the risks to the outlook do remain quite balanced, though, and resulted in a still-elevated core inflation rate at 2.4%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Inflation is measured on a year-on-year basis, but the shorter-term developments do show a slight pickup of momentum in core inflation on the back of services prices. The three-month rate of core inflation is currently increasing to an annualised 2.7% rate. Then again, selling price expectations for services have eased further, which is a decent predictor of future price developments. For the months ahead, we do expect a further easing of the inflation rate, but not much below the 2% mark. The 'good place' seems to be with us for some time to come.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Content Disclaimer</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This publication has been prepared by ING solely for information purposes irrespective of a particular user's means, financial situation or investment objectives.

Steel has always been the centre of gravity for vanadium. But for the first time, that balance is beginning to shift...As long-duration battery technology gains ground, vanadium is increasingly being pulled into the energy transition, particularly through vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs), which use the metal as their key electrolyte. VRFBs are not new, but they are now entering a more serious growth phase. <strong>Installed capacity is expected to rise ten-fold by 2030, moving from 4 GWh today to around 40 GWh, with potential annual deployments of up to 50 GWh.</strong> As this happens, the amount of vanadium directed to battery storage could climb from around 5% of total supply to nearly 27% over the next five years. </p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Note: Bold emphasis by the author.</em></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vanadium miner news</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>Vanadium producers</em></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>G</strong><strong>lencore [LSX:GLEN] [HK:805] (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLCNF\">OTCPK:GLCNF</a>)</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Glencore is a large vanadium producer, but vanadium production represents only a small portion of their revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On October 17 Mining Weekly <a href=\"https://www.miningweekly.com/article/community-unrest-erupts-at-glencores-rhovan-mine-after-expiry-of-solar-project-contracts-2025-10-17\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a>: </p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Community unrest erupts at Glencore’s Rhovan mine after expiry of solar project contracts...Rhovan, a vanadium mining and processing facility managed by Glencore Ferroalloys, began construction of the solar plant in 2024 as part of its efforts to support sustainable energy use...Now, after being notified that their contracts will not be renewed, the affected employees have expressed dissatisfaction and initiated a labour dispute, demanding continued employment.
