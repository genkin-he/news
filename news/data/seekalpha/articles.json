Full-year results are due on 5 March.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I last covered the name in my March 2021 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4412456-aviva-stock-focus-benefiting-capital-structure-not-earnings-yet\">“buy” note,</a> <em>Aviva: More Focus Is Benefiting Capital Structure, But Not Earnings Yet</em>, since when the share price has gone up 26% according to SA data (although Google Finance shows a 72% increase during that period in the sterling-denominated London-listed shares, probably reflecting a 2022 share consolidation). At that point, I saw value in the company’s swiftly executed strategic plans to focus on its core U.K. business and significantly reduce its footprint outside the British Isles, though it has hung onto its Canadian business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the past few months, Aviva has hit its highest share price since 2008. I still like the business but am now moving to a “hold” rating on valuation grounds. The streamlined, U.K.-centred strategy has continued to guide the company since I last wrote on it and, I think, is delivering positive financial results. However, I think that is reflected in the share price growth since I last wrote.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aviva’s Been Getting the Basics Right</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am not a fan of pinning success stories in large firms on a leader (though a single bad leader can easily damage a business), but current management under chief executive Amanda Blanc deserves credit for having led a successful increase in the firm’s fortunes (and indeed she got that in the form of a damehood, though predictably that was not merely for her business performance but for services to “business, gender equality, and net-zero”).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The playbook here has been simple but no less powerful for it. Aviva’s home market of the U.K. is its largest, and Aviva also has a commanding position in it, as the country’s largest general insurer by far. By getting rid of many overseas distractions that lacked scale and focusing on entrenching its position in the U.K. even more, it has built a bigger moat. Those overseas sales also helped improve the balance sheet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most notable move over the past few years to grow the U.K. business’s scale even more was the <a href=\"https://www.aviva.com/investors/acquisition-of-direct-line-insurance-group-plc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">acquisition</a> of local rival Direct Line (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIISF\" title=\"Direct Line Insurance Group plc\">DIISF</a>), which was <a href=\"https://www.aviva.com/newsroom/news-releases/2025/07/aviva-completes-acquisition-of-direct-line/\" rel=\"nofollow\">completed</a> last July. That was no surprise: Direct Line had seen a number of ex-Aviva employees appointed to senior management, and it was struggling as a standalone entity after profit warnings. So far it seems that Aviva has been able to integrate it fine, although I think it will be another couple of years before we can draw a definitive conclusion on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4794506-selling-direct-line-after-bumpy-3-year-investment\">whether Direct Line had just been poorly run in the years before its takeover or whether underlying problems like the quality of its underwriting were to blame</a> and have persisted. My bet is on the former, but I think a longer timeframe is needed for full judgement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has 25.2 million customers, including over 21 million in the U.K. That equates to 4 in 10 adults: a very impressive number.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The economies of scale here stem not only from having lots of customers but also from being able to cross-sell to them. At the interim results stage last year, the company noted that a record 5.5m customers have two or more policies with it. The Direct Line acquisition ought to have further helped this push for scale, alongside organic growth. Aviva estimates it will add £225m of run-rate savings in 2028 and deliver capital synergies of over half a billion pounds by the end of this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This all shows through in the company’s key performance metrics, which have been coming in well. As a snapshot, here are the headlines from the company’s interim results in August.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720743680096421_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"956\" data-height=\"223\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720743680096421_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Aviva interim results financial toplines\" width=\"640\" height=\"149\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720743680096421_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720743680096421_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720743680096421_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720743680096421_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Company interim results statement</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not only are those strong year-on-year numbers for operating profit and Solvency II operating own funds generation, but they are also markedly stronger than a few years beforehand.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Indeed, Aviva’s performance has been strong enough for it to raise its medium-term targets in a Q3 trading statement last November.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720744042017586_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"660\" data-height=\"275\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720744042017586_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Aviva new targets\" width=\"640\" height=\"267\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720744042017586_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720744042017586_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720744042017586_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720744042017586_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Company Q3 trading statement</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividend is Growing at an Attractive Pace, Though That is Set to Slow Next Year</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Having cut its dividend per share in 2013, the company did the same in 2020, by a painful 30%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since then, though, the dividend growth has been solid. In the chart below, I omit some messily timed 2020 payments to make it easier to compare recent dividends with those before the 2020 cut. The chart does not satisfactorily reflect the impact of a 2022 share consolidation, but the overall point is that the dividend per share has been growing and is now greater than it was before the cut six years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720742752591286_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"977\" data-height=\"639\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720742752591286_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Aviva dividend history\" width=\"640\" height=\"419\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720742752591286_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720742752591286_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720742752591286_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/51578875-17720742752591286_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>compiled by author using data from company website</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The current financial year saw the interim dividend raised by 10%, which reflected “our usual mid-single digit dividend increase as well as a further mid-single digit uplift following the completion of the Direct Line transaction,” and the company set the expectation of the full-year dividend following this approach.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further out, the expectation is for mid-single-digit growth in the cash cost of the dividend. That is not the same as mid-single-digit growth in dividend per share, and if the share base expands, the per-share dividend growth will be lower. That is not unlikely over time. The Direct Line acquisition alone led to a 14% higher share count.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, I expect the company to keep growing its dividend per share at the low to mid-single-digit level each year from next year onwards.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently the yield is 5.6%, which compares very favourably to the current FTSE 100 yield of 3.1%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Full-Year Results Are Due in the Coming Week</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aviva is set to publish its full-year results on Thursday, 5 March.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current management has had a tendency to surprise only on the upside, and I expect that to continue, so I am not anticipating any nasty surprises, though of course it's always a risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It will be interesting to get further detail on how the Direct Line integration has bedded down, though to date the company has already been positive on that front.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond that, I will be looking to see whether Aviva has maintained its strong performance from the interim point discussed above.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m Moving to a “Hold” on Valuation Grounds</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But while I like the business and see ongoing potential for its performance, I think the rising share price of recent years has built that in, and accordingly, I move to a “hold” rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The share price is 30 times earnings, which I see as expensive. Insurance earnings tend to move around a lot, making that metric of limited use sometimes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management's guided 11% CAGR for operating EPS over the next three years could see operating EPS increase strongly if delivered successfully. Operating EPS will not necessarily translate to EPS. But even allowing for it to, that would still put the medium-term prospective P/E in the low 20s, which I still do not think offers attractive value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aviva’s price-to-book ratio currently sits at around 2.2, which I do not see as cheap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the company is well run, I see risks associated with its size, as, for example, presuming a standard per-customer cost impact, the scale of its customer base makes it costlier to respond to smaller rivals seeking to build market share through lower pricing than if it had fewer customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the complaints I heard anecdotally from Direct Line customers in the couple of years prior to the takeover was that premiums had gone up substantially without any real justification in terms of claims costs, etc. The company at the time presented a different perspective, but rising policy costs seemed to hurt demand for Direct Line’s insurance products, and this remains a price-sensitive market.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Earlier this year, the US removed President Nicolas Maduro from Venezuela, which is a positive for the refining sector. Venezuela produces the cheaper, heavy crude that our refineries specialize in processing. Incremental flows from this country can provide a cheap fuel that will widen margins. Indeed, PSX is <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553585-phillips-66-citgo-seek-to-buy-crude-directly-from-venezuela-reuters\">working</a> to source crude directly from Venezuela to enhance margins. I view this geopolitical development as a modest positive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, this weekend the US and Israel launched a coordinated military strike on Iran. This operation is still developing, and the final outcome is unknown. Given years of sanctions, the US &amp; Iran have essentially no economic linkage, and Iran’s crude oil exports have been pressured. However, if this conflict spills out more broadly, it could disrupt wider Middle East supplies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If such spillover occurs, this conflict risks disrupting oil supplies more than refined products, which could pressure margins. Offsetting this, the Administration could make releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to keep markets adequately supplied, especially as it likely will want to limit any inflationary impacts. Heightened geopolitical risk premiums may also widen crack spreads. All else equal, I expect a near-term pop in crack spreads, but I view the longer-term impacts as less clear.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As geopolitical tensions have ramped up, we have seen crack spreads widen, passing $30 (as a reminder, this measures how much refiners make turning oil into refined products like gasoline and diesel). In late 2024, cracks dropped into the mid-teens, which created a difficult operating environment for the sector given strong throughput. Then, over 2025, we saw crack spreads steadily improve until a weakening late in the year. They have come surging back and are now over $30. As a reminder, I view ~$25 as the long-term norm, so we are in a clearly favorable environment for the sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-17722972599484978.png?io=w640\" alt=\"line chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"487\" height=\"184\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-17722972599484978.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-17722972599484978.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-17722972599484978.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Energy Stock Channel</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The initial crunch lower in spreads in November/December came as physical fundamentals weakened. As you can see below, gasoline inventories rose more than even the seasonal norm, going from unusually low to unusually high. In general, higher inventories should mean weaker pricing power and lower spreads. Importantly, inventories have stabilized as we approach the seasonal drawdown.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-17722972599271884.png?io=w640\" alt=\"line chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"495\" height=\"349\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-17722972599271884.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-17722972599271884.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-17722972599271884.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>EIA </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, it is notable how much crack spreads have outperformed in recent weeks, largely decoupling from the physical market. This speaks to how much geopolitical risk premium has been added. With potential outages in the Middle East, markets are essentially encouraging US refiners to increase throughput. This creates a very favorable near-term dynamic for PSX and peers. That said, if geopolitical risk fades, I would expect crack spreads to narrow again into the $20-25 area.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating Performance Has Improved</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, turning to recent financial results, in the company’s <a href=\"https://investor.phillips66.com/financial-information/news-releases/news-release-details/2026/Phillips-66-Delivers-Strong-4Q-Operating-Results-While-Enhancing-Portfolio/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">fourth quarter</a>, Phillips 66 earned $2.47, which beat <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4546938-phillips-66-non-gaap-eps-of-2_47-beats-by-0_32\">estimates</a> by $0.32. In its refining business, profits rose by ~25% sequentially to $542 million, thanks to a widening in margins to ~$12.50. This represented a solid 98% capture of market levels. It operated at 99% utilization in Q4. I expect utilization to tick down in Q1 into the lower 90% area as the company does seasonal maintenance activity, which temporarily reduces capacity. As you can see below, it has steadily improved utilization after investing in modernizing its facilities. While doing this, PSX has also reduced operating costs by about 15% to $6/barrel. These self-improvement efforts should structurally enhance margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-1772297259948577.png?io=w640\" alt=\"line chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"504\" height=\"245\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-1772297259948577.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-1772297259948577.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-1772297259948577.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Phillips 66</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aside from its refining assets, PSX has developed an integrated set of midstream assets, providing takeaway capacity from major basins all the way to export markets. These cash flows are less cyclical and more fee-like in nature. They provide enough cash flow to fully cover their dividend and maintenance, with cash flow from other businesses supporting buybacks or M&amp;A. NGL transportation and fractionation volumes each hit records, passing 1mbd, and management reiterates its goal of reaching $4.5 billion in run-rate midstream EBITDA by the end of 2027. Midstream EBITDA was a solid $952 million in Q4, or $3.8 billion annualized. Given ongoing growth projects, I view its 2027 target as very attainable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-1772297259993479.png?io=w640\" alt=\"map\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"422\" height=\"519\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-1772297259993479.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-1772297259993479.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Phillips 66</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">PSX also has a chemicals unit that is a joint venture with Chevron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX\" title=\"Chevron Corporation\">CVX</a>). While PSX has premiere, low-cost assets in the US and Middle East, the sector has faced significant challenges from structural oversupply given weak industrial demand and increased Chinese capacity. I expect challenging conditions to persist, and we need to see more supply cuts, especially from high-cost operators in Europe. The unit made just $19 million in Q4, down from $72 million last year. For the full year, profits fell by $500 million to $329 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I expect the chemicals environment to be equally bad in 2026, though if housing activity improves by late in the year, that can provide a floor. Ongoing supply cuts should eventually restore pricing power, but this is a very drawn-out process. In the longer term, I believe PSX should consider divesting the unit, as I see little operational synergies, especially with the midstream business growing and providing more diversification to cash flow. That said, I do not view such an action as imminent. Given the significant macro pressures, valuation in the chemical sector is depressed, and PSX would be best to wait for a cyclical turn before considering strategic alternatives.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares Remain Attractive</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the fourth quarter, PSX generated $2.8 billion of operating cash flow, aided by working capital improvements. This enabled the company to reduce debt by $2 billion, ending the year at $19.7 billion. PSX is carrying 38% net debt to capital, which is a bit more than I like to see. The company aims to get net debt down by about $3 billion over the next two years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-1772297260090353_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"680\" data-height=\"567\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-1772297260090353_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"534\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-1772297260090353_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-1772297260090353_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-1772297260090353_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/13071522-1772297260090353_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Phillips 66</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I view this as attainable so long as crack spreads average over $23, though it will limit buybacks in the near term. During Q4, it repurchased $274 million of stock. Thanks to buybacks, its share count is down about 1.7% from last year; I expect slightly more buybacks this year. In <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4550618-phillips-66-raises-quarterly-dividend-by-58-to-127share\">February</a>, Phillips 66 increased its dividend by 6%, and shares now offer a 3.3% dividend yield. I view its dividend as secure</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, PSX is performing well. Its investments in refining modernization are paying off, and midstream continues to grow. Beyond this, the heightened geopolitical tensions are likely to be positive for refiners and PSX given its US-centric asset base. Back in December, I was targeting $12 of 2026 EPS and $16+ in 2027. I still view this as the central case, especially with crack spreads widening in the near term. At ~9.5x 2027 earnings, I view PSX as attractive still, though there is less upside than a few months ago. I expect shares to push to the $165-$170 area, and PSX also can help provide diversity in portfolios amid geopolitical tensions. With 8-10% upside plus a secure dividend, I remain a buy on Phillips 66.</p>",

While the fund has still<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> seen higher volatility than peers, its sector mix shifts since </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4725386-avlv-low-valuations-risk-reward-not-as-attractive-due-to-sector-exposure\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">my last review</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> in late 2024 have reduced cyclical exposure, while a heavier stance in technology is consistent with its quality, given above-average profitability in the sector. In my view, this makes AVLV better positioned going forward, as the fund is likely to continue to outperform more conservative value ETFs in a risk-on environment, given its balanced sector mix, while its disciplined valuation is expected to limit downside risk somewhat, despite relatively high historical drawdowns. The next sections will detail the fund’s holdings and compare valuation, performance, and volatility with value peers and the broader equity market.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">ETF Description &amp; Highlights</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV is an actively managed ETF that seeks exposure to companies that exhibit above-average profitability and value characteristics, without tracking any specific index.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock selection process relies on portfolio managers’ research to identify companies that meet the fund’s strategy, primarily among the 1000 largest U.S. companies. To achieve this, portfolio managers take into consideration value indicators, especially book-to-price ratios, while profitability is measured through adjusted cash from operations to book, among other metrics. Once a company is selected for inclusion in the fund, it is weighted according to its market capitalization, plus a factor relative to its value and profitability metrics, so that constituents that offer more compelling metrics are overweight in the portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of February 21, AVLV had nearly $10.6 billion under management, invested in 261 stocks, with an average market capitalization of $111.8 billion. Although the fund has a primary focus on larger companies, the reality is that large and mega caps make up only 32.6% and 18.9% of the portfolio, while mid caps account for 35.2% and small caps 13.2%. This reflects a well-balanced market cap distribution when compared to the Russell 1000, a mid and large cap benchmark, where large and mega caps represent over 70% of the index, versus nearly AVLV’s nearly 51%. It is also worth noting that the fund had a more pronounced mid-cap bias in October 2024, as the representation of this category was 40.5% at that time compared to 35.2% now. This gap is not large, to be sure, but it suggests a shift toward large caps, where valuations are admittedly above the broader market but profitability is generally higher than in smaller companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV’s top ten holdings are Micron (3.26%), Exxon Mobil (3.20%), Meta (2.91%), Apple (2.78%), Caterpillar (2.68%), Amazon (2.51%), Lam Research (2.49%), Merck (2.31%), JPMorgan Chase (2.13%), and Costco (2.07%). Together, these positions account for roughly 26% of total assets, highlighting a less concentrated profile compared to the Russell 1000’s 34%, and a relatively diversified sector mix, spanning tech-driven segments, energy, industrials, healthcare, and financial services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108406238074.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"621\" height=\"416\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108406238074.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108406238074.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108406238074.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The table below shows a list of six value-oriented ETFs that will be referred to as the peer group for AVLV in this analysis. The first and the largest fund is the Vanguard Value Index Fund ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTV\" title=\"Vanguard Value Index Fund ETF\">VTV</a>), with roughly $150 billion in assets. VTV tracks the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index using a market-cap weighting approach. Next is the iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IWD\" title=\"iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF\">IWD</a>), which follows an index that is the value version of the Russell 1000, and also applies a market-cap-weighted design. The SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 Value ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPYV\" title=\"State Street SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 Value ETF\">SPYV</a>) selects stocks from the S&amp;P 500 with attractive valuations and weights them by float-adjusted market cap. The Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Value ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHV\" title=\"Schwab US Large-Cap Value ETF\">SCHV</a>) tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Value Total Stock Market Index, also following a capitalization-weighted structure. Meanwhile, the Vanguard Mega Cap Value ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MGV\" title=\"Vanguard Mega Cap Value Index Fund ETF\">MGV</a>) focuses on the U.S. larger companies, with a heavy concentration in large (74%) and mega caps (18%). Finally, the Invesco S&amp;P 500® Pure Value ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RPV\" title=\"Invesco S&amp;P 500 Pure Value ETF\">RPV</a>) favors stocks with strong value characteristics and applies a weighting methodology that reflects this stricter investment strategy, giving more weight to companies offering more compelling value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-1772310841469536_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1208\" data-height=\"417\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-1772310841469536_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"221\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-1772310841469536_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-1772310841469536_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-1772310841469536_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-1772310841469536_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a sector allocation perspective, <a href=\"https://www.avantisinvestors.com/avantis-investments/avantis-us-large-cap-value-etf/#overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">AVLV</a>’s largest exposures are to industrials (16.4%) and consumer discretionary (16.2%), two areas that are not typically the most value-oriented. A second tier includes financial services (15.0%), technology (14.2%), and energy (12.9%). Further down, communication services (9.1%), consumer staples (7.9%), and healthcare (6.2%) are still relevant sectors, while the fund holds marginal positions in basic materials (1.8%), utilities (0.3%), and real estate (0.1%). Although there have been only relatively small changes in the fund’s exposure to the largest sectors compared to late 2024, holdings in technology and healthcare have increased somewhat, while the allocation to financial services, basic materials, and energy has decreased by the 1.5% to 3.0%. This suggests a slight rotation away from interest rate and commodity prices sensitive areas, while the increased weight in technology points to a more balanced value-growth profile, as this sector is typically a high-growth segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Relative to the Russell 1000, though, AVLV remains most overweight in energy (+9.5%), followed by industrials (+6.8%) and consumer discretionary (+5.9%), while it is underweight in technology (-17.8%) and healthcare (-3.5%), despite the increased allocation to these sectors now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Breaking down AVLV’s holdings across its largest sectors, we see that in industrials, the fund owns over 40 stocks, led by railroads, through Union Pacific and CSX, while it is also overweight in logistics with positions in FedEx, UPS, and Expeditors. The fund also holds heavy equipment makers Caterpillar and Deere, along with positions in airline operators like Delta and United Airlines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In consumer discretionary, the fund is again broadly diversified, holding more than 40 companies. The largest position by far is Amazon, while the fund also leans into the travel and leisure segment via cruise operators Royal Caribbean and Carnival, as well as holdings in the casino and resort industry through Las Vegas Sands. The fund also owns off-price retailers TJX and Burlington, and automakers General Motors and Ford, while small positions in specialty retailers Ulta Beauty, Best Buy, and Dick’s Sporting Goods round out the fund’s exposure to the sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond these top three sectors, where the allocation is fairly diversified, AVLV still holds relevant positions in other sectors, mostly with a much more concentrated exposure. These include technology, where the fund’s holdings are Apple, Micron, Lam Research, Applied Materials, and NVIDIA, along with key names in energy (Exxon and ConocoPhillips), communications services (Meta, Alphabet, Verizon, and AT&amp;T) (1.50%), healthcare (Merck and Gilead), and staples (Costco).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given AVLV’s strategy centered on value and profitability, the portfolio has suffered only modest rotation since late 2024, despite a few changes since then, such as increased allocation to companies like Alphabet, Amazon, Micron, Merck, and American Express, offset by divestiture from Chevron, Walmart, Qualcomm, and Wells Fargo. Still, such rotations are pretty much in line with an actively managed philosophy. That said, I believe that the high profitability usually seen in big tech names is expected to serve as an anchor to keep those names in the portfolio for the foreseeable future. On the other hand, margin pressures in more cyclical segments like energy, or even rate-sensitive areas like financial services, may drive potential changes from here, which would be in line with what we have already seen over the past year or so.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-1772310841762908_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"941\" data-height=\"542\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-1772310841762908_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"369\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-1772310841762908_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-1772310841762908_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-1772310841762908_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-1772310841762908_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV is overweight in consumer discretionary (+8.4%), communication services (+4.4%), and technology (+2.3%) relative to the peer group of value ETFs. Much of that is a byproduct of the fund's large allocation to a few big tech names, such as Meta, Apple, and Amazon. The fund also overweights industrials and energy, which gives it a more cyclical exposure. On the other hand, AVLV is underweight in typical value sectors, such as healthcare (-8.3%), financial services (-5.2%), utilities (-3.9%), and consumer staples (-2.7%), as peers favor these sectors, aiming to drive their average valuation lower than the broader market. As a result, AVLV has only a moderate sector correlation in the 0.50-0.70 range with most peers. At the same time, AVLV’s sector correlation with RPV (0.29) is arguably low, driven by RPV’s stronger value screens, leading to limited exposure to technology (2.2%), along with heavier exposure to healthcare (17.0%) and consumer staples (15.3%), amplifying AVLV’s modest stance in these two areas. From here, given the low stock rotation across these funds, as we will see later, I do not see a drastic change in this picture over the coming quarters, unless there is a sharp reset in the overall market valuation, which would create new opportunistic allocations for funds seeking to maximize value in their portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108419019203_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1138\" data-height=\"512\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108419019203_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"288\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108419019203_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108419019203_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108419019203_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108419019203_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Attractive Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV’s 16.6x P/E represents roughly a 24% discount to the Russell 1000’s 22.0x. The gap is in large part driven by a sector mix that underweights a high-multiple sector like technology and has overweight positions in value areas, such as energy and consumer staples. Another core driver stems from lower valuation multiples in virtually all sectors, with discounts of over 30% in consumer discretionary, healthcare, and financial services. At the individual stock level, core contributions include Verizon (8.6x P/E), General Motors (7.9x), Merck (11.9x), and Allstate (7.0x), all trading well below the broader market average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund trails in growth. Its historical earnings growth of 4.1% falls short of the Russell 1000’s 7.9%, and its sales growth of 5.9% is also below the benchmark’s 6.9%. This softer growth profile is largely tied to sector positioning, which, much like in the valuation analysis, underweights a high-growth area like technology. In addition, positions in consumer discretionary and industrials are also a drag, due to a much lower growth profile than in the Russell 1000. Overweight positions in companies in these sectors, including UPS and Las Vegas Sands, which have seen slow-to-negative growth, help explain the fund’s softer growth profile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV shows relatively strong profitability; However, it is not as high as the Russell 1000. Its EBITDA margin (28.3%) is about 2.3 percentage points lower than the index’s 30.6%, and the fund’s ROE (34.5%) also lags the benchmark’s 48.2% by roughly 13.7 points. AVLV’s underweight exposure to the high margins usually seen in technology does not help, of course. In addition, there is a negative contribution from lower margins in consumer staples and financial services relative to the Russell 1000. Shares of Costco (EBITDA margin 4.7% and ROE 30.3%) and Progressive (EBITDA margin 16.5% and ROE 34.2%) are good examples of a few individual holdings that contribute to lower margins compared to elevated metrics seen in the Russell 1000, thanks to the index’s heavy weights in high-margin big tech companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108416081693.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar and ETFs’ websites, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"566\" height=\"462\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108416081693.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108416081693.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108416081693.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar and ETFs’ websites, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although AVLV does not exhibit a pronounced tilt toward sectors like financial services and consumer staples, its P/E remains just below most peers. This is at least in part explained by overweight exposure to energy, another typical value sector, along with stock picking across most sectors with a low P/E profile, as highlighted in the previous sections. Meanwhile, the only fund trading at a deep discount to AVLV is RPV (11.2x P/E), driven by a very limited position in technology and a heavy exposure to small and mid caps, two categories that usually trade at a discount to large and mega caps, which together account for over 85% of the fund.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With all peers trading at a large discount to the broader market, it is fair to say that AVLV and the peer group continue to show more reasonable valuations in a market that has seen P/Es ratios above the historical average. That said, given AVLV’s modest turnover, I see the fund continuing to trade at a reasonable level and at a significant discount to the benchmark, unless a shift in sentiment leads to multiple compression in sectors like technology and consumer discretionary. If that were to happen, though, I would not be surprised to see AVLV increasing exposure to big tech names, as lower valuation multiples and consistent above-average profitability would make these companies more appealing to the fund.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108416207333_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1061\" data-height=\"291\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108416207333_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"176\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108416207333_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108416207333_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108416207333_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108416207333_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outperforming Peers</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With its inception in September 2021, AVLV is still a relatively new fund. However, it has already gone through different market environments, ranging from a steep selloff in 2022, due to rising interest rates, to a strong bull market in the following years, fueled by AI prospects. Overall, as expected for a value-oriented fund, it held up much better than the Russell 1000 in 2022, but it lagged in the bullish years of 2024 and 2025, due to its more conservative exposure. It is also worth noting that it is doing very well year to date, with double-digit returns, while the Russell 1000 gained only 1.3%. Still, AVLV’s 3-year total returns of 19.3% have not kept pace with the benchmark’s 21.5%, as the overall market has been predominantly in a bullish mode during this period. AVLV has outperformed its peers, though, thanks to stronger gains in 2023, 2024, and 2025, when it has been the top performer so far.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During this time, AVLV’s volatility has been in line with the Russell 1000, with a 3-year beta of 1.00. Meanwhile, all peers have betas below 1.00, with funds like VTV and MGV exhibiting betas at 0.77 and 0.80, respectively, as peers in general have had a much more defensive sector mix, with heavier allocations to healthcare, consumer staples, and utilities. A point of concern is AVLV’s 3-year downside capture ratio of 128, which is much higher than the Russell 1000 (105) and also most peers, which have been in the 102-121 range. As we can see, MGV’s downside capture of 102 indicates that mega caps have seen more moderate declines during selloffs. On the other hand, other funds, especially RPV, have seen higher readings driven by their heavier exposure to mid and small caps, which are typically more vulnerable to declines during adverse market conditions like 2022.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108421205754_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1107\" data-height=\"583\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108421205754_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"337\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108421205754_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108421205754_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108421205754_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-17723108421205754_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With an average daily trading value of about $37.0 million, AVLV is a liquid fund, though it is still a long way from heavy-volume peers VTV and IWD, both north of $800 million a day. That helps explain AVLV’s 0.07% bid-ask spread, which can not be compared with most funds, all in the 0.01%-0.03% range. The fund’s 5% turnover is the lowest in the group, highlighting its longer-term investment horizon, though peers like VTV, SCHV, and MGV have shown turnover below 10%. Its expense rate of 0.15% is just above the peer group’s average, reflecting relatively low costs in the whole value ETF space. The fund offers a 1.25% dividend yield, which is below the peer group’s 1.93%, driven by its lighter allocation to above-average-yielding sectors, like healthcare, financial services, and utilities. AVLV’s tracking error of above 1.10% highlights its active management profile, while most peers track benchmark indexes. Finally, the fund’s 3-year Sharpe ratio of 0.83 is well above most peers, only below MGV (0.87), thanks to its outperformance, which more compensates for its higher volatility from a risk-adjusted return perspective.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-1772310842097097_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"996\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-1772310842097097_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Morningstar and Seeking Alpha, consolidated by the author\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"289\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-1772310842097097_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-1772310842097097_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-1772310842097097_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49456258-1772310842097097_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Morningstar and Seeking Alpha, consolidated by the author</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AVLV’s core characteristic is its attempt to offer value to investors without compromising business quality. This strategy helps explain most of the fund’s profile. It holds names like Meta, Apple, and Amazon and remains reasonably diversified, blending value sectors with material allocations to industrials and technology. In the current backdrop, with mixed inflation readings, uncertainties about the impact of AI on companies across the equity market, and elevated expectations for companies’ financial results and guidance, investors appear more cautious during an earnings season that has been marked by volatile performance, especially for mega-cap stocks.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That setup creates a balanced setup for AVLV. If the market becomes more risk-averse and P/E multiples compress, the fund’s discount can help cushion the downside, though not as much as more defensive ETFs in the peer group. On the other hand, the fund’s more balanced sector mix should support performance relative to other value funds if sentiment improves from here. That said, it is reasonable to expect the fund to achieve returns in the range of high-single digit to low-double digit over the next twelve months, assuming S&amp;P 500 earnings growth remains in the mid-teens, as forecast at the beginning of the year by the financial market. If that happens, it would be a strong opportunity for AVLV, as it would build on the strong results already recorded year to date. In conclusion, my take is that AVLV remains a good option for investors seeking balanced value exposure, without falling into deep defensive territory.</p>",

I like the concept, yet I am not impressed by the annualized and risk-adjusted returns TACK has delivered since inception in 2022 (that is, they were meaningfully lower than those of IVV).</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TACK Strategy And Portfolio</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As described on its <a href=\"https://www.fairleadfunds.com/tack\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a>, TACK is an actively managed ETF that \"seeks capital appreciation with limited drawdowns.\" As per the summary prospectus, Katie Stockton, CMT, is the portfolio manager.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is explained that</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>TACK is a model-driven exchange-traded fund aligned with Fairlead Strategies disciplined technical methodology with a discretionary overlay reserved for market anomalies. The primary goal of the model is to leverage sector leadership, while navigating equity market downdrafts through asset allocation.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The core of the process is technical analysis:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The basis of TACK’s model is technical analysis, with an emphasis on indicators designed to identify long-term trends and major trend reversals. Opportunities are identified using signals from a combination of technical indicators designed to identify price trends, after which a quantitative momentum overlay is applied to finalize the portfolio.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, what I see here is a strategy designed to rotate between certain ETFs (sector ETFs as well as gold and Treasury ETFs enumerated on page 2 of the summary prospectus) and position for risk-on and risk-off scenarios. As to the portfolio composition:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The Fund anticipates holding between 5 and 8 ETF positions, distributed between “risk-on” sector ETF positions of approximately equal sizes and occasional “risk-off” ETF positions of varying sizes based on the results of our technical analysis filters.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The following definitions are given for \"risk-on\" and \"risk-off\":</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>A market where stocks are outperforming bonds is said to be a “risk-on” environment. When stocks are selling off and investors are favoring bonds or gold, the environment is said to be “risk-off.”</p></blockquote> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Are TACK's Current Style Factor Exposures?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is an interesting question, and to answer it, we need to look not at just the portfolio composition but at the aggregate underlying holdings (that is, amalgamate all the equities which are present in the ETFs that TACK is currently long).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So as of February 26, we see eight sector ETFs in the TACK portfolio (so, it is quite obviously in risk-on mode now), with the State Street Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLE\" title=\"State Street Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF\">XLE</a>) being the top one. In the portfolio, there are also the BBH SWEEP Vehicle and Receivables/Payables (a 0.4% combined net weight).</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td>ETF</td> <td>Ticker</td> <td>Weight in TACK, as of February 26</td> </tr> <tr> <td>State Street Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF</td> <td>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLE\" title=\"State Street Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF\">XLE</a>)</td> <td>13.41%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>State Street Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF</td> <td>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLU\" title=\"State Street Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF\">XLU</a>)</td> <td>13.39%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>State Street Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF</td> <td>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLI\" title=\"State Street Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF\">XLI</a>)</td> <td>12.87%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>State Street Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF</td> <td>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLB\" title=\"State Street Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF\">XLB</a>)</td> <td>12.35%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>State Street Communication Services Select Sector SPDR ETF</td> <td>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLC\" title=\"State Street Com Svc Sel Sec SPDR ETF\">XLC</a>)</td> <td>12.15%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>State Street Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF</td> <td>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLV\" title=\"State Street Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF\">XLV</a>)</td> <td>11.99%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF</td> <td>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLK\" title=\"State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF\">XLK</a>)</td> <td>11.86%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>State Street Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF</td> <td>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLY\" title=\"State Street Cons Disc Sel Sect SPDR Income ETF\">XLY</a>)</td> <td>11.57%</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Data from TACK</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sectors TACK ignores are financials, consumer staples, and real estate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next, below are the top five stocks TACK has exposure to via the ETFs:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col span=\"2\"> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td>Company</td> <td>Ticker</td> <td><strong>Weight in TACK, as of February 26 (approximate)</strong></td> <td>Weight in IVV, as of February 26</td> <td>Sector</td> <td>Market Cap, $ Billion</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Exxon Mobil Corporation</td> <td>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>)</td> <td><strong>3.19%</strong></td> <td>1.06%</td> <td>Energy</td> <td>618.93</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Amazon.com, Inc.</td> <td>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>)</td> <td><strong>2.44%</strong></td> <td>3.42%</td> <td>Consumer Discretionary</td> <td>2,232.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Meta Platforms, Inc.</td> <td>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>)</td> <td><strong>2.42%</strong></td> <td>2.42%</td> <td>Communication</td> <td>1,661.94</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Chevron Corporation</td> <td>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX\" title=\"Chevron Corporation\">CVX</a>)</td> <td><strong>2.32%</strong></td> <td>0.59%</td> <td>Energy</td> <td>367.47</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tesla, Inc.</td> <td>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA\" title=\"Tesla, Inc.\">TSLA</a>)</td> <td><strong>2.22%</strong></td> <td>1.94%</td> <td>Consumer Discretionary</td> <td>1,533.17</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Created by the author using data from the ETFs and Seeking Alpha.

I would like to provide the following table that encapsulates the essentials.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49647006-17722474638092208.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TACK and IVV comparison\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"601\" height=\"536\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49647006-17722474638092208.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49647006-17722474638092208.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49647006-17722474638092208.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Financial data as of February 27 <span>(Calculated by the author using data from Seeking Alpha and the ETFs)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>TACK's aggregate underlying holdings have around 79.9% weight in IVV, as per my calculations. However, this is just the top of the iceberg as weights of individual stocks are different considerably. For example, the trillion-dollar league has just 14.6% weight in TACK but 36.8% in IVV, in part because the Fairlead ETF currently ignores the financial sector, hence, it has no exposure to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.B</a>). So, its 2.4x lower weighted average market cap is the direct consequence of that.</li> <li>Next, I see a considerable value tilt, which is assisted by softer growth characteristics, and slightly weaker quality (not critically, of course, as its allocation to stocks with a B- Quant Profitability grade or higher is only 2.5% weaker than IVV's).</li> <li>Ultimately, TACK has notably larger exposure to low-beta stocks (the weighted average 24-month beta is just 0.86), thanks to its considerable allocation to XLU (while utilities account for only about 2.4% of the IVV portfolio).</li> </ul> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">TACK Performance</h3> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Advantages</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First and foremost, TACK has significantly outperformed the iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF since the beginning of 2026, which is an achievement worth appreciating given the challenging environment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_7b846c00a6357a09bc10f389f61ef9ad.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_7b846c00a6357a09bc10f389f61ef9ad.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_7b846c00a6357a09bc10f389f61ef9ad.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_7b846c00a6357a09bc10f389f61ef9ad.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another advantage of TACK is that it does deliver downside protection, though not a perfect one. More specifically, in the fact sheet (as of December 31, 2025), TACK compares its returns to those of the Russell 1000 Equal Weight Index. This index is tracked by the Invesco Russell 1000 Equal Weight ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EQAL\" title=\"Invesco Russell 1000 Equal Weight ETF\">EQAL</a>), which I have <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874232-eqal-long-term-issues-outweigh-recent-outperformance\">covered</a> recently, with a Hold rating assigned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now let us look at the data for the April 2022–January 2026 period. In the first case, EQAL is selected as a benchmark.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col span=\"2\"> </colgroup> <tr> <td>Metric</td> <td><strong>TACK</strong></td> <td>EQAL</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Upside Capture Ratio (%)</td> <td><strong>55.85</strong></td> <td>100</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Downside Capture Ratio (%)</td> <td><strong>49.48</strong></td> <td>100</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Maximum Drawdown (%)</td> <td><strong>-11.30</strong></td> <td>-19.70</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Created by the author using data from Portfolio Visualizer</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the second case, I used IVV as a benchmark. And here, TACK's result looks decent again. As we can see, it captured just 61.8% of IVV's downside. I should also add that its maximum drawdown over the period was -11.30%, which looks much more comfortable than IVV's -20.28%.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td>Metric</td> <td><strong>TACK</strong></td> <td>IVV</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Upside Capture Ratio (%)</td> <td><strong>55.71</strong></td> <td>100</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Downside Capture Ratio (%)</td> <td><strong>61.8</strong></td> <td>100</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Created by the author using data from Portfolio Visualizer</em></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vulnerabilities</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The principal vulnerability which I believe TACK has is that it cannot capture a sufficient share of the market's upside (which I usually proxy with an S&amp;P 500 ETF), which, in turn, translates not only into rather soft annualized return but also into unimpressive risk-adjusted returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More specifically, since its inception in March 2022, TACK has significantly underperformed IVV. It has also trailed EQAL, though, in fairness, it should be noted that EQAL has raced ahead of it just recently.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_9185aad98797ed8045fbf8e02d5bb79f.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_9185aad98797ed8045fbf8e02d5bb79f.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_9185aad98797ed8045fbf8e02d5bb79f.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_9185aad98797ed8045fbf8e02d5bb79f.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next, over the April 2022–January 2026, TACK delivered risk-adjusted returns (i.e., the Sharpe and Sortino ratios) that were also not particularly impressive compared to those of IVV, although they were stronger than EQAL's.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49647006-17723124812553165.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TACK, EQAL, and IVV comparison\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"493\" height=\"342\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49647006-17723124812553165.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49647006-17723124812553165.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/49647006-17723124812553165.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IVV was selected as a benchmark by the author <span>(Created by the author using data from Portfolio Visualizer)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In sum, TACK delivers precisely what is promised: \"capital appreciation with limited drawdowns.\" I find the strategy perfectly sensible, and I mostly like how the fund is currently positioned (that is, I would not construct an argument against it).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, to me, upside capture is critical, and TACK does not deliver on that front. So, investors who are focused on minimizing drawdowns and are content with the upside capture ratio in the 50s, should shortlist the fund as a possible satellite holding. They should keep in mind that it comes with a rather high <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TACK/expenses\">expense ratio of 70 bps</a>, which is a significant detractor from total returns. Besides, the median bid/ask spread of 0.1279% (as of February 27) is rather wide. Also, while AUM is considerable at $278.9 million, it is not particularly large, even though the fund has almost four years in the books. All in all, my rating on TACK is Hold.</p>",

The Fund tacked on a </span><strong class=\"paywall-full-content\">3.39%</strong><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> return in February that pushes it to an </span><strong class=\"paywall-full-content\">8.03%</strong><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> gain on the year. My watchlist, however, in between, managed a modest gain of </span><strong class=\"paywall-full-content\">0.21%</strong><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> in February and is up only </span><strong class=\"paywall-full-content\">1.33%</strong><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> on the year.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My main objective from this stock screening process is to have it present me with potentially opportune investment ideas to consider for further review. I also want those ideas to offer a reasonable starting dividend yield and have the potential to deliver a double-digit total return in the next 3 to 5 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tracking monthly performance is a bit meaningless since these ideas are meant to be held for the long term. But it is still useful to compare the performance of the watchlist to VYM and SPY just to get a baseline idea of its merit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Inception-to-date, my Top 10 list has a CAGR of <strong>14.43<em>%,</em></strong> while VYM's CAGR is <strong>16.58<em>%</em></strong> and SPY's CAGR is <strong>16.46<em>%.</em></strong> And while my list is trailing both benchmarks in total return, it does offer twice the starting yield of VYM and more than 3 times the yield of SPY. And measured by my own benchmark with a 12% target, it has performed adequately.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As stated earlier, the primary purpose of this watchlist is to generate investment ideas for further review. My selection process focuses on identifying potentially high-quality companies trading for attractive prices, with an emphasis on a respectable starting dividend yield and a focus on future return potential. I track the list's overall performance to measure the effectiveness of this stock screening process. Performance is measured against SPY and VYM as benchmarks for alternative investment options. The goal is for the watchlist to achieve a long-term CAGR of 12% while offering dividend investment ideas with a track record of dividend growth and a reasonable starting dividend yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you'd like to know more about the methodology and selection criteria for this watchlist, you can read the first article in the series <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4393411-high-dividend-yield-stock-watchlist-for-december-2020\">here</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">March 2026 Watchlist</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here are the stocks chosen by my methodology.

For 4 months now I've been testing 2 alternate variations to identify the top 10 stocks each month. The original process blends quality and value, while the alternate variants are a pure quality or value focus. The chosen stocks are identified in the final 3 columns of the table.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>O - Original process.</li> <li>Q - Quality focus.</li> <li>V - Value focus.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a good amount of overlap between the three variants, but the pure Quality and Value focus does offer some unique selections.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the bottom of the table you'll find the average metrics for each portfolio and the full dataset. In total, 58 unique companies were analyzed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On average, the 10 selected stocks for each portfolio have the following characteristics:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Forward Dividend Yield</strong>:<ul> <li>Original - 3.30%</li> <li>Quality - 3.27%</li> <li>Value - <strong>3.80%</strong> </li> <li>All 58 - 3.44%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Potential Undervaluation</strong>:<ul> <li>Original - 30%</li> <li>Quality - 21%</li> <li>Value - <strong>42%</strong> </li> <li>All 58 - 6%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>5-Year Dividend Growth Rate</strong>:<ul> <li>Original - <strong>13.5%</strong> </li> <li>Quality - 13.1%</li> <li>Value - 9.6%</li> <li>All 58 - 8.3%</li> </ul> </li> <li> <strong>Expected Rate of Return</strong>:<ul> <li>Original - 20.9%</li> <li>Quality - 19.2%</li> <li>Value - <strong>21.6%</strong> </li> <li>All 71 - 12.5%</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Quality variant disregards valuation and focuses purely on historical fundamental growth. The Value variant disregards fundamentals and focuses entirely on valuation. The original strategy combines both, blending fundamentals and valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's worth noting that the initial screening process that was used to generate the shortlist of 58 stocks for review already applies quality and dividend filters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The expected rate of return \"Ex. Ret.\" is calculated by summing the current dividend yield, the potential return to fair value over the next 5 years, and a long-term earnings growth forecast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Please note that my return forecasts are based on assumptions and should be interpreted as rough estimates. However, I do believe these companies have the potential to generate better returns over the next five years compared to the other high-yield stocks that passed the initial screening process but ranked lower in quality and valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 5-year historical dividend yield shown in the image above came directly from Charles Schwab. At the end of the article, I share my own Dividend Yield Theory valuation model that may present different historical dividend yields and future return potential.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Past Performance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The watchlist performed poorly in February with a modest gain of 0.21%; it did manage to outperform SPY but trailed VYM significantly. While performance last year and thus far this year was below par, the long-term CAGR remains comfortably above my desired 12%. The screening process has identified many stocks that are seeing strong negative sentiment. This doesn't bode well for short-term returns, but these are exactly the ideas this process should be surfacing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here's a short- and long-term performance breakdown.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p><strong>Date</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>Top 10 List</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>ALL</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>VYM</strong></p></td> <td><p><strong>SPY</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>1 month</strong></p></td> <td><p>0.21%</p></td> <td><p>4.49%</p></td> <td><p>3.39%</p></td> <td><p>-0.86%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>3 month</strong></p></td> <td><p>1.36%</p></td> <td><p>8.68%</p></td> <td><p>7.31%</p></td> <td><p>0.68%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>6 month</strong></p></td> <td><p>1.79%</p></td> <td><p>11.04%</p></td> <td><p>12.14%</p></td> <td><p>6.95%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>2020</strong></p></td> <td><p>16.44%</p></td> <td><p>16.44%</p></td> <td><p>16.09%</p></td> <td><p>14.99%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>2021</strong></p></td> <td><p>26.31%</p></td> <td><p>27.91%</p></td> <td><p>26.21%</p></td> <td><p>28.76%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>2022</strong></p></td> <td><p>-11.95%</p></td> <td><p>-4.25%</p></td> <td><p>-0.45%</p></td> <td><p>-18.16%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>2023</strong></p></td> <td><p>22.07%</p></td> <td><p>9.56%</p></td> <td><p>6.58%</p></td> <td><p>26.18%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>2024</strong></p></td> <td><p>18.83%</p></td> <td><p>15.77%</p></td> <td><p>17.59%</p></td> <td><p>24.89%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>2025</strong></p></td> <td><p>7.84%</p></td> <td><p>14.00%</p></td> <td><p>14.75%</p></td> <td><p>17.32%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>2026</strong></p></td> <td><p>1.33%</p></td> <td><p>9.53%</p></td> <td><p>8.03%</p></td> <td><p>0.60%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Since Inception</strong></p></td> <td><p>105.25%</p></td> <td><p>125.86%</p></td> <td><p>126.60%</p></td> <td><p>125.36%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><strong>Annualized</strong></p></td> <td><p>14.43%</p></td> <td><p>16.50%</p></td> <td><p>16.58%</p></td> <td><p>16.46%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is worth noting that all of the past and present stocks that appeared on this watchlist, whose cumulative return is shown in the \"ALL\" column above, are performing in line with VYM and SPY. We can deduce from this that the presented ideas each month drive better long-term returns beyond the initial month they are tracked, depicted in the \"Top 10 List\" performance data.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Individual watchlist returns for February 2026 were:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Automatic Data Processing (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ADP\" title=\"Automatic Data Processing, Inc.\">ADP</a>) -13.15%</li> <li>American States Water (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AWR\" title=\"American States Water Company\">AWR</a>) <strong>+6.04%</strong> </li> <li>Blackstone (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BX\" title=\"Blackstone Inc.\">BX</a>) -19.49%</li> <li>Canadian National Railway (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CNI\" title=\"Canadian National Railway Company\">CNI</a>) <strong>+16.60%</strong> </li> <li>NIKE (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NKE\" title=\"NIKE, Inc.\">NKE</a>) <strong>+0.60%</strong> </li> <li>Penske Automotive Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PAG\" title=\"Penske Automotive Group, Inc.\">PAG</a>) <strong>+1.35%</strong> </li> <li>Paychex (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PAYX\" title=\"Paychex, Inc.\">PAYX</a>) -9.19%</li> <li>Sonic Automotive (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SAH\" title=\"Sonic Automotive, Inc.\">SAH</a>) <strong>+4.60%</strong> </li> <li>United Parcel Service (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UPS\" title=\"United Parcel Service, Inc.\">UPS</a>) <strong>+10.72%</strong> </li> <li>Essential Utilities (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WTRG\" title=\"Essential Utilities, Inc.\">WTRG</a>) <strong>+4.00%</strong> </li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see, 7 out of the 10 chosen stocks delivered positive returns. But the 3 negative returns were quite significant, dragging the overall cumulative gain down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is how the Original, Quality, and Value selections performed in February:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Original: <strong>+0.21%</strong> </li> <li>Quality: <strong>-2.79%</strong> </li> <li>Value: <strong>+4.49%</strong> </li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And here is how each variant has been performing since November 2025:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Original: <strong>+4.34%</strong> </li> <li>Quality: <strong>+4.35%</strong> </li> <li>Value: <strong>+8.69%</strong> </li> <li>VYM: <strong>+11.02%</strong> </li> <li>SPY: <strong>+0.87%</strong> </li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Value variant is now performing the best yet still trailing VYM. This isn't surprising with the growth-to-value rotation we have seen this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top 5 performing past and present watchlist stocks in February 2026:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Corning (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GLW\" title=\"Corning Incorporated\">GLW</a>) <strong>+45.92%</strong> </li> <li>Hershey (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSY\" title=\"The Hershey Company\">HSY</a>) <strong>+22.13%</strong> </li> <li>Coca-Cola Europacific (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CCEP\" title=\"Coca-Cola Europacific Partners PLC\">CCEP</a>) <strong>+20.43%</strong> </li> <li>FedEx (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FDX\" title=\"FedEx Corporation\">FDX</a>) <strong>+20.09%</strong> </li> <li>Canadian National Railway <strong>+16.60%</strong> </li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top 5 Stocks by Total Return Since Joining the watchlist:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Broadcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>) <strong>+670.13%</strong> (58 months).</li> <li>Corning <strong>+375.57%</strong> (36 months).</li> <li>Bank of New York Mellon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BK\" title=\"The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\">BK</a>) <strong>+296.93%</strong> (64 months).</li> <li>JPMorgan (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPM\" title=\"JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.\">JPM</a>) <strong>+248.91%</strong> (64 months).</li> <li>Canadian Imperial Bank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CM\" title=\"Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce\">CM</a>) <strong>+236.80%</strong> (64 months).</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top 5 Stocks by Average Monthly Return Since Joining the watchlist:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Canadian National Railway <strong>+16.60% </strong>(1 month).</li> <li>Sonic Automotive <strong>+4.60% </strong>(1 month).</li> <li>Corning <strong>+4.43%</strong> (36 months).</li> <li>Valero Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VLO\" title=\"Valero Energy Corporation\">VLO</a>) <strong>+4.20%</strong> (11 months).</li> <li>Broadcom <strong>+3.58</strong><strong>%</strong> (58 months).</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In total, there have been 108 unique high-yield dividend stocks that have appeared in the top 10 list during the past 64 months. This includes the expanded coverage of stocks chosen for the pure quality or value variants and stocks that are no longer actively trading.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positive Return:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>87 stocks</li> <li>91.04% gain on average</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Negative Return:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>21 stocks</li> <li>-18.22% loss on average</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A second method to measure the merit of this strategy is to run a buy-and-hold test on all the chosen stocks. To run this test, I calculate the investment return of dollar cost averaging into the 10 chosen stocks each month. If a stock reappears on the top 10 list in a subsequent month, another equal sum of money is invested in that position. The positions are held indefinitely, and the objective is to see how many of the ideas presented by this screening process have yielded positive total returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I broke this test into 2 formats; the first tests all the stocks, while the second focuses solely on stocks that have appeared in the top 10 list at least ten times.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here are the findings:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All stocks.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Total tested: 108</li> <li>Positive total return: 87</li> <li>Success Rate: <strong>80.56%</strong> </li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stocks presented on the list at least 10 times.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Total tested: 33</li> <li>Positive total return: 27</li> <li>Success Rate: <strong>81.82%</strong> </li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This test, much like the performance summary covered earlier, is purely focused on measuring the merit of the screening process. Investing in all the presented stocks each month would not be a practical long-term strategy to adopt. This list should be used as a starting point for ideas and further research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here are all 108 stocks, their total return since inception, and the number of months

A plethora of high-quality enterprise software businesses are now suddenly<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> trading at fire-sale prices, reacting sharply to fears about AI’s competitive threats.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, in a few months we may look back on this period in the stock market as a short-lived crash similar to the early fallout from President Trump’s reciprocal tariffs in April 2025. In the meantime, investors should position our portfolios with careful stock-picking in mind, as many high-quality value plays are deeply oversold and overdue a rebound.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Warby Parker (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WRBY\" title=\"Warby Parker Inc.\">WRBY</a></span>), in particular, is a stock that I find to be losing a lot of appeal. The eyeglasses maker, which made waves for its DTC business model and low-cost frames, is up ~15% since the start of January as the market looks forward to the company’s coming AI glasses with Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>).

Even though the stock is down ~10% since then, I’m not convinced enough that there’s a compelling enough growth story here to justify a market-topping adjusted EBITDA multiple, especially when gross margins are sliding downward. Amid the emergence of many better small- and mid-cap value plays in the tech sector, Warby Parker’s luster is vastly diminished, and I’m dropping my rating on the stock to <strong>sell.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Don’t get me wrong: I don’t necessarily think Warby Parker is a bad business, but I do think it’s mispriced in today’s market. Since valuation is my primary gripe against this stock, let’s open the discussion with a look at the company’s latest guidance and how current valuation multiples stack up against it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At current share prices near $25, Warby Parker trades at a market cap of $3.06 billion. Netting off the $286.4 million of cash (against zero debt) on the company’s latest balance sheet gives us an enterprise value of $2.77 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-17722679459374993_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2400\" data-height=\"1314\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-17722679459374993_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Warby Parker outlook\" width=\"640\" height=\"350\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-17722679459374993_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-17722679459374993_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-17722679459374993_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-17722679459374993_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Warby Parker outlook <span>(Warby Parker Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown in the chart above, for FY26 the company is guiding to 10-12% y/y revenue growth and $117-$119 million in adjusted EBITDA (+23% y/y) that reflects a 12.2% midpoint margin, up slightly from 10.9% in FY25.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This positions Warby Parker's valuation at a sharp 23.5x EV/FY26 multiple. I don't see the appeal in paying a market-topping EBITDA multiple when top line growth is slowing to the low double digits, with customer growth slowing to the single digits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We note there is \"upside risk\" from two factors: success in AI glasses and a potential removal of tariffs, which is a major wild card still up in the air. We should remind ourselves, however, that Warby Parker's tech partner here is Google, which <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/052115/how-why-google-glass-failed.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">failed to get Google Glass</a> off the ground in 2013.

Revenue growth decelerated two points versus 15% y/y growth in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This has made us worried about some of the recent customer trends that the company is experiencing. As shown below, Warby Parker’s count of active customers (defined as those who have made a purchase within the last twelve months) grew by only 30k in Q4, with y/y growth slowing to 7% (from 9.3% in Q3). We note as well that this is atypical seasonality for Warby Parker and for most DTC brands, as Q4 contains the core holiday period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268059855135_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2346\" data-height=\"1272\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268059855135_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Warby Parker Q4 key trended metrics\" width=\"640\" height=\"347\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"347\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268059855135_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268059855135_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268059855135_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268059855135_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Warby Parker Q4 key trended metrics <span>(Warby Parker Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management attributed a portion of the slowdown to macro factors and noted that prescription glasses units sold declined -6% y/y.

We believe this performance reflects continued market share gains. We drove healthy unit volumes, average selling price and customer growth, while prescription glasses units declined 6% industry-wide according to the Vision Council.</p> <p>And while much of the category relied on significant price increases, we mitigated the impact of tariffs while preserving our unmatched value proposition and maintaining prices on the vast majority of our offerings, including our $95 prescription glasses.”</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, we do note to Warby Parker’s credit that it is attempting to appeal to higher-value customers who are more likely to purchase more holistic vision care from the company - encompassing eye exams and contact lenses on top of eyeglasses. The rising mix of these customers has driven the company’s average revenue per customer 5.7% y/y higher to $324. The company also plans to try to work deals with insurance carriers to broaden insurance eligibility, which may help to pull in more customers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another major growth priority for 2026 is expansion of the company’s retail store network, which is the principal lever for Warby Parker to improve consumer brand recognition. The company ended FY25 with 323 retail stores, opening 47 new stores within the year. It plans to step up new store openings to 50 in FY26, marking 15% net location expansion for next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268115620897_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2360\" data-height=\"1284\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268115620897_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Warby Parker retail expansion\" width=\"640\" height=\"348\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"348\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268115620897_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268115620897_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268115620897_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/33427965-1772268115620897_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Warby Parker retail expansion <span>(Warby Parker Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the profitability front, Warby Parker’s gross margins declined -170bps y/y to 52.4%, owing to tariffs. That said, the company did manage to offset this headwind with a 340bps reduction in selling, general, and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue.

Don’t count on AI smart glasses to provide a huge burst in revenue, either, as this is still an unproven concept at this stage that hasn’t gained broad consumer acceptance. Take advantage of the post-earnings upside to sell.</p>",

The gains come<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> as NECB has made some progress on attracting new deposits in H2 2025, although more work remains on this front.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Fed rate cuts and deposit pressure have resulted in a small contraction in NECB's net interest margin, I believe the shares offer further upside for the remainder of 2026, confirming my previous Buy rating on the company. My positive outlook is underpinned by:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>A very undemanding 7.45x trailing P/E multiple representing a circa 40% discount to regional bank peers.</li> <li>Solid capital position and a valuation below book value, making incremental share repurchases highly accretive.</li> <li>Supreme credit quality, notwithstanding risks from a deteriorating macroeconomic backdrop, particularly in New York.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Readers not familiar with NECB may find the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829420-northeast-community-bancorp-low-earnings-multiple-makes-up-for-deposit-pressures\"><em>Company Overview</em> section in my previous article</a> insightful. The only change I would highlight is that following H2 2025 deposit inflows, the loan-to-deposit ratio has shrunk to 1.15x, still elevated relative to peers.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q4 2025 Results Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NECB <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20379931-northeast-community-bancorp-inc-reports-results-for-the-quarter-and-year-ended-december-31#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">reported</a> EPS of $0.79/share, a 5.3% Y/Y jump relative to the prior year quarter. The increase was principally driven by loan growth at 2.6% Y/Y, while credit quality remained supreme (0% nonperforming loans).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company made notable progress on attracting new deposits, which were up 9.3% relative to H1 2025. Still, compared to the end of 2024, total deposits were still down by about 3.2%. Against the backdrop of a growing loan portfolio, NECB clearly needs to continue to put an emphasis on deposit inflows during 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NECB navigated recent Fed rate cuts quite well, with the net interest margin standing at 5.18%, only 0.11% below the 5.29% achieved in Q4 2024. I would expect some incremental decline in net interest margins in 2026 as the Fed continues with Fed rate cuts, while NECB strives to further reduce its loan-to-deposit ratio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Book value stood at $25.67/share at the end of 2025, a circa 10% Y/Y increase, which is quite impressive when you consider that NECB also paid a total of $0.80/share in four quarterly dividend payments. The bank<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20332376-northeast-community-bancorp-inc-announces-third-stock-repurchase-program#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\"> recently authorized a third buyback program</a>, although the start has apparently been quite slow, with shares outstanding up 1.1% Y/Y in Q4 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To conclude, I believe NECB reported a solid set of financial results, notwithstanding the need to make further progress on deposit outflows.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Macro Backdrop</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NECB operates exclusively in New York and Massachusetts. As such, any potential deterioration in credit quality may be precipitated by a worsening macroeconomic environment in these two states.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">New York has seen a notable <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.ny.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">increase in the unemployment rate to 4.6% at the end of 2025</a>, some 0.6% higher compared with July 2025. As such, I believe provisioning could pick up in 2026 should current trends persist.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As far as Massachusetts is concerned, the macroeconomic picture there is somewhat more stable, with <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.ma.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.8% in recent months</a>. Even so, both states exhibit an unemployment rate above the national average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To sum up, with the caveat that unemployment data may improve alongside an expected pickup in U.S. economic growth in 2026, current macro indicators suggest some deterioration in credit quality for NECB this year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation and Rating</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even after the strong start to 2026, NECB shares still trade at a circa 6% book value discount, indicating persistent investor worries about H1 2025 deposit outflows. For comparison, regional bank peers held in the iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IAT\" title=\"iShares US Regional Banks ETF\">IAT</a>) at <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239521/ishares-us-regional-banks-etf\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">roughly 1.27x their book value</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The good news is that with NECB's robust CET1 capital ratio of 15.36%, the company can take advantage of the persistent book value discount via share repurchases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Turning to profitability, NECB also scores well compared to regional bank peers. The bank generated $3.25/share in 2025 earnings, indicating a trailing P/E of 7.45x. Regional bank peers held in IAT trade at a much higher valuation of roughly 12.32x their trailing earnings. In essence, on a trailing P/E basis, NECB offers a discount of around 40% relative to its direct peers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NECB only has one analyst estimate for 2026-2027 earnings, with <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NECB/earnings\">2026 EPS seen at $3.39/share</a>, representing a growth rate of only 4.3% relative to 2025. I would view this estimate as conservative in light of NECB's low dividend payout ratio of only 0.25x, indicating that many of the above-mentioned headwinds stemming from deposit pressures and a deteriorating macro environment are likely priced in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To conclude, notwithstanding risks that I will discuss in the next section, I anticipate NECB to continue to outperform regional bank peers, confirming my previous Buy rating on the shares.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As things stand, NECB boasts supreme credit quality and a healthy CET1 capital ratio. As such, risks in the immediate term look quite benign. That said, a potential further deterioration in New York/Massachusetts macroeconomic conditions may ultimately result in a rise in loan delinquencies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">72% of NECB's loan portfolio is concentrated in construction loans, with a further 18% allocation to residential real estate financing. While incremental Fed rate cuts create a favorable backdrop for the real estate sector in general, NECB's loan concentration will likely result in highly cyclical earnings, as opposed to regional bank peers, which typically exhibit greater diversification (although I should note that outsized real estate exposure is not that uncommon among the sector).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last but not least, while NECB has made progress on attracting deposits in H2 2025, the company's wide discount relative to regional bank peers shows persistent worries about NECB's competitive position in the deposit market. In essence, failure to attract deposits at attractive terms may result in a further decline in NECB's net interest margin.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The broader U.S. financials sector has struggled to post gains so far in 2026, impacted by a decline in long-term risk-free interest rates, which will likely put pressure on net interest income. Jitters around private credit markets have also likely weighed on returns.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Against this backdrop, NECB shares have posted modest gains, with the bank reporting overall solid Q4 2025 results and making progress on attracting new deposits, although more work remains to be done on this front in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NECB stock trades at a wide discount to regional bank peers, indicating that risks related to a potential rise in non-performing loans and/or a further contraction in the net interest margin are already priced into the shares. As such, I see room for further NECB outperformance relative to U.S. financial peers, confirming my previous Buy rating on the shares.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thank you for reading.</p>",

The credit quality is primarily BB and below, but there is a small slice of investment-grade exposure here as well. Given some relatively longer average life of the underlying portfolio and the small slice of investment-grade exposure, that does make the fund's effective duration a bit higher relative to its high-yield-focused peers.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund has seen its discount widen since our prior update, which makes it a bit more attractive to consider today. However, it is still trading near its longer-term average. In fact, there was a period of time when a double-digit discount wasn't all that uncommon, though that was a handful of years ago. The fund, maintaining its monthly distribution that is working out to over 13%, is likely keeping investors interested. While coverage of the distribution leads to sustainability questions, I suspect they won't be too quick to cut this payout to investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that, I believe that EHI remains a hold today based on wanting to see a deeper discount level before considering it appealing enough to jump in. If that came with the impact of an overall market downturn, that would help to make it that much more interesting as well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">EHI Basics</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>1-Year Z-score: -0.27</li> <li>Discount/Premium: -4.63%</li> <li>Distribution Yield: 13.15%</li> <li>Expense Ratio: 1.49%</li> <li>Leverage: 29.24%</li> <li>Managed Assets: $288.57 million</li> <li>Structure: Perpetual</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EHI's<a href=\"https://www.franklintempleton.com/investments/options/closed-end-funds/products/90293/SINGLCLASS/western-asset-global-high-income-fund-inc/EHI#geographic-breakdown\" rel=\"nofollow\"> investment objective</a> is to seek \"high current income, with a secondary objective of total return.\" To achieve that, the fund will \"provide a global, leveraged portfolio of investment grade, below investment grade, and emerging market fixed-income securities.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that the fund is leveraged, that increases volatility and risk for investing in the fund. The other side of this is that it can also help to drive performance higher when things are going well. However, it also comes with a cost. When including those interest expenses, the fund's total expense ratio comes in at 4.14%</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance - Distribution Likely Drives Increased Interest</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4814592-ehi-discount-remains-narrow-as-fund-shifts-toward-lower-quality-holdings\">our last update</a>, the fund has provided positive total returns, though its price has declined somewhat since then.

Over the last five years, the fund's average discount has come in around 4.5%—about right where we are now.

Since then, EHI has maintained its distribution for quite a number of years now, and the last move was to even increase it in early 2024. That tends to attract income-focused investors—particularly, those that also find higher yields enticing because the current distribution works out to 13.15%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721982443716316_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EHI Distribution History\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"278\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721982443716316_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721982443716316_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721982443716316_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721982443716316_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EHI Distribution History <span>(CEFConnect)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on the NAV rate, that works out to a hefty 12.54%. That's quite an elevated level and would call into question some sustainability issues over the longer term. Remember, a CEF can essentially pay whatever it would like as long as the NAV remains above $0.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With EHI, they were able to <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241009829828/en/Western-Asset-Global-High-Income-Fund-Inc.-Announces-Preliminary-Results-of-Transferable-Rights-Offering\" rel=\"nofollow\">conduct a rights offering</a> in 2024. It was dilutive to the NAV, as most ROs are, as they are done at a discount to the NAV per share at the time. Still, one of the reasons they were able to pull off an RO is because the fund was flirting around a premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">They likely understand that any distribution cut would send the discount widening out quite materially. Therefore, despite the elevated level, I suspect they are quite content with keeping the payout right where it is in the hopes of eventually being able to pull the RO trigger once again. While it hits the NAV per share due to the dilution, the overall assets being managed increase nonetheless.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last <a href=\"https://www.franklintempleton.com/tools-and-resources/lit-preview/90293/SINGLCLASS/western-asset-global-high-income-fund-inc#semiannual-report\" rel=\"nofollow\">semi-annual report</a> for the period ended November 30, 2025, showed that net investment income coverage came in at around 64%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721987659343102_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EHI Financial Highlights\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"465\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721987659343102_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721987659343102_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721987659343102_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17721987659343102_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EHI Financial Highlights <span>(Western Asset)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For most fixed-income CEFs, we'd ideally like to see this over 100%. However, this isn't all that common anymore these days as CEFs attempt to keep discounts narrow by paying out relatively higher distributions. That said, the current distribution coverage from EHI is quite low, even relative to some of its high-yield peers. Of course, this is what we would expect when we see a distribution rate that is pushing over 12% on a NAV basis.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">EHI's Portfolio</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of peers, over the longer term, the fund has underperformed most of its peers listed on CEFData.

When comparing that to EMB, the effective duration comes in at 6.82 years, and HYG shows its portfolio with an effective duration of 2.75 years. Thus, we can presume that some of the longer duration is coming in from the emerging market government debt that EHI carries, making it relatively more interest rate sensitive with its longer maturity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a fund that leans heavily into below-investment-grade credit, they do have the common key feature to fight back against the risks that can pose—which is a significant number of holdings at 404 for the fund. This is then carried out through no individual position carrying too much of an overweight allocation. After the first handful of names, the allocations don't even reach 1% of the fund's weighting anymore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/1058901-1772301387925381_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1030\" data-height=\"490\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/1058901-1772301387925381_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EHI Top Ten Holdings\" width=\"640\" height=\"304\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"304\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/1058901-1772301387925381_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/1058901-1772301387925381_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/1058901-1772301387925381_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/1058901-1772301387925381_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">EHI Top Ten Holdings <span>(Western Asset)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to investing in EHI, the discount isn't quite there yet, even as it has widened a touch since our prior update. I'd personally feel more comfortable investing at an 8%+ discount level, and if that occurs during increased market volatility when high-yield spreads widen, that would be even more ideal. One of the key features of EHI is that it pays a relatively higher distribution rate while also providing a bit of exposure to emerging market debt. Unfortunately, that distribution coverage is rather weak, but I also don't suspect they have intentions of cutting it anytime soon. I think the main goal would be to get the fund to trade closer to a premium once again and then possibly initiate another rights offering.</p>",

Ship tracking sites are showing oil tankers making U-turns to avoid the strait. It is unclear if this ship, and others like it that are making similar maneuvers, are leaving due to the strait's closure or for their safety to avoid crossfire during a conflict. Many tankers may have insurance carriers that demanded they avoid the strait as news of strikes broke out, and so they turned around even if the Iranian authorities didn't cause it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For now, this is still in the fog of war information-wise, and so it's unclear how much further oil could go. It will depend on the depth of escalation moving forward and what is really going on with passage through the strait.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59331233-17723083347120278.png?io=w640\" alt=\"oil tanker avoids strait of hormuz\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"548\" height=\"416\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59331233-17723083347120278.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59331233-17723083347120278.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59331233-17723083347120278.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The worse this conflict gets, the higher oil is likely to go, and I expect that to hold true until there is some resolution about the strait. That doesn't mean that there has to be resolution about Iran or their government. The U.S. breaking their control of the strait and allowing transit could cause oil to come back down quickly.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">OPEC+ Still Has A Say</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a point to note here that the price of oil was beaten down all last year, and so even though it has jumped on this recent speculation, its absolute levels are still fairly low to recent history.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_e955269ccb8fbe4a8a65fcb66572f2f3.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_e955269ccb8fbe4a8a65fcb66572f2f3.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_e955269ccb8fbe4a8a65fcb66572f2f3.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_e955269ccb8fbe4a8a65fcb66572f2f3.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the levers of the oil market is OPEC+, which Iran is part of but whose controlling members Iran just shot missiles at. Sure, the targets were American bases, but I cannot imagine that there is a single Gulf monarchy that is happy with Iran right now.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next meeting is March 1st, and I imagine that they will work on making sure that OPEC+ oil is allowed through the strait. Whether that is achievable or not is unclear, so for now, all we can do is speculate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps a solution is reached where Iran allows partial passage for OPEC+ tankers, but not for U.S. or EU-flagged vessels. Again, speculation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another thing that they will decide is their target output levels. They could hike production again to use volume to offset the price hikes. OPEC+ has been working on creating an oil glut over the last year, and while they slowed production recently, it is common for them to change direction quickly in response to events like these. This is especially poignant for the Gulf monarchies because they are responding to what is happening on their doorstep this time around, unlike with Venezuela.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_b43da37598c6b15d4c3d4b2efe109dfd.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_b43da37598c6b15d4c3d4b2efe109dfd.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_b43da37598c6b15d4c3d4b2efe109dfd.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/saupload_b43da37598c6b15d4c3d4b2efe109dfd.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stocks Will Shake It Off</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We don't buy any oil from Iran, and the U.S. doesn't import much from the affected countries.

Stocks may sell off as fear sets in for traders and speculators. For the record, I do not believe we will go to war with Iran, but I do not control what narratives the market puts weight in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It behooves us to remember that markets are forward-looking. They react to today's news, but it becomes priced in quickly, and tomorrow's news quickly takes over.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A friend said it best to me when we were discussing the potential of the U.S. attacking Iran again earlier this week:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>They always do it on a Friday. That way, the markets can fall over the weekend. By Monday's open, there's been two news cycles. That's a lot of time for other stories to take over.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And history shows us the truth in this. Past wars have not been long-term negative catalysts for markets. They don't always even cause sell-offs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59331233-1772309814792282.png?io=w640\" alt=\"the market after wars\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"627\" height=\"1536\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59331233-1772309814792282.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59331233-1772309814792282.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/59331233-1772309814792282.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Annotations by Sofien Kaabar, CFA <span>(Bloomberg)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold Wins the Day, Of Course</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It was no surprise to see gold hit &gt;$5,400 after the news dropped of escalation between the U.S. and Iran. Gold has been particularly responsive to geopolitical tensions since 2022, replacing the role of the U.S. dollar as the ultimate safe haven from chaos.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Imagine telling an investor in the 00s that traders would run to treasury duration to avoid geopolitical risk. <em>They worry about what sovereigns are doing, so they buy sovereign debt? </em>Mind-blowing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not the part about gold, though—that checks out for most people. Geopolitical risk invites investors to load up on an asset that sovereigns don't outright control.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683394035092561_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"gold response to geopolitical events\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"994\" height=\"481\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683394035092561_origin.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683394035092561_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683394035092561_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683394035092561_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683394035092561_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>World Gold Council</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Through last year, geopolitical risk was a strong driver for gold's returns. This is similar to oil, and so similar risks should be considered—a conclusion of the tensions could mean a sell-off is in store. Gold in particular is in a much more precarious position than oil since its producers are not putting it in a glut.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can see just how much of a drag momentum has been, and I expect it to continue to be, as long-term holders realize their gains after the best year for gold in decades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683384206242476_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"drivers of gold returns\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"987\" height=\"470\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683384206242476_origin.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683384206242476_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683384206242476_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683384206242476_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/1/13/59331233-17683384206242476_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>World Gold Council</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If you want to know more about my gold convictions, take a look at my most recent gold-focused article, “<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4859734-gold-isnt-near-a-peak\">Gold Isn't Near a Peak.</a>” It's crazy to think that the article was written just a month ago, and gold is up ~15% since.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Ultimately, the jury is still out on how things will unfold in Iran. The U.S. has not given any signals if more attacks are imminent, and it's unclear if or for how long Iran intends to try to close the Strait of Hormuz. That will be a determining factor for how markets react.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Oil is bid up on speculation, and a full closure, which would likely include direct U.S. intervention in the area, could cause oil to spike. Beware if you are trading oil or oil-related ETFs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I don't expect too much pain to bleed over into the U.S. economy even if oil is stopped, as we do not import much from the Persian Gulf. The stock market may react negatively at first, but time will heal things, as other news cycles will begin to factor in. This conflict does not stop the next earnings call from happening, and so, for now, I am not worried about much movement in indexes, although individual firms with exposure to the conflict area are another story.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gold is the key winner of rising geopolitical tensions in our current market, and I expect precious metals across the board to benefit regardless of the outcome in Iran.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Crises and conflicts like this are a good reminder that position sizing is more important than security selection. It is very difficult to time these events and to trade them, so ensuring that your risk exposure is appropriate is critical for your portfolio when bombs start flying—and they <em>are </em>flying.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I hope for peace.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thanks for reading.</p>",
