As discussed in my prior coverage of DB, appropriately titled \"<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4819812-deutsche-bank-attractively-valued-ahead-of-the-investor-deep-dive\">Deutsche Bank: Attractively Valued Ahead of The Investor Deep Dive</a>\", DB's current market value gives it little credit for anticipated increases in earnings per share in 2026-2028.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bank's Q3 2025 results confirm the positive outlook, with a much-needed surge in Private Bank profitability hopefully the start of incremental profitability improvements in the bank's lowest efficiency segment. As such, I maintain my Buy rating on DB, driven by:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Robust capital position, allowing for additional share repurchases in 2026.</li> <li>An attractive valuation relative to the broad European financials sector, as well as direct European banking competitors.</li> <li>The potential for above-average EPS growth over the medium term, with upside to my €4.00/share EPS target for 2028 should equity markets stay at current levels.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this article, I will expand on these points and discuss risks related to the investment case.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Company Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">You can access all DB results on its website <a href=\"https://investor-relations.db.com/reports-and-events/quarterly-results\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.

Instead, the bank is more dependent on capital markets activity which drives Investment Bank/Asset Management performance. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 2025 Result Highlights</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With markets at all-time highs it is little surprise that Deutsche Bank is doing quite well. The bank reported EPS of €0.89/share in Q3 2025, up 9.9% Y/Y. Diluted shares outstanding were only down 1.3% Y/Y, hence the bulk of the improved performance was driven by better underlying profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The return on tangible equity [ROTE] stood at 10.7%, up 0.5%. This was achieved partially thanks to lower credit costs of 0.35%, down 0.06% Y/Y. Provisions releases in the Corporate Bank and model updates in the Private Bank were positive contributors, only partially offset by higher provisions in the Investment Bank (due to commercial real estate exposure as discussed on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834572-deutsche-bank-aktiengesellschaft-db-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">conference call</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a segment perspective, ROTE marked the highest improvement in Asset Management (+9.2% to 28.1%) and Private Bank (+7.4% to 12.6%), with more moderate improvements in Corporate Bank (+2.9% to 16.2%) and Investment Bank (+1.7% to 10.7%) segments:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/44733396-17619772963380432.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financial results overview\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"387\" height=\"461\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/44733396-17619772963380432.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/44733396-17619772963380432.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/44733396-17619772963380432.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/44733396-17619772963380432.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/44733396-17619772963380432.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/44733396-17619772963380432.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/44733396-17619772963380432.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/44733396-17619772963380432.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Financial results overview <span>(Deutsche Bank Q3 2025 Results Presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Loans were flat Q/Q, while deposits increased 2%. I think this is a positive development as it allows DB to be more aggressive on deposit pricing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Private Bank and Asset Management net flows remained positive, with Asset Management assets under management reaching €1.05 trillion. The tangible book value stood at €30.17/share, up 2% Q/Q.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Segment Discussion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For me the strong performance in the Investment Bank and Asset Management segments was largely expected given the results coming out of U.S. peers in recent weeks (of course there is always the chance of one bank underperforming peers in a given quarter but this was clearly not the case with DB). As such, I believe the standout performance was the Private Bank which has been DB's lowest return segment for some time. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We observe that the Private Bank segment delivered 4% higher revenues and 9% lower expenses, benefiting from higher net interest income (net interest margin improved by 0.3% to 2.5%), as well as progress on workforce optimization with DB continuing to close physical offices.

The current CET1 ratio already includes a €2.4 billion provision for 2026 distributions, of which €1.9 billion will likely go towards a dividend of €1.00/share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://investor-relations.db.com/share/analysts-and-consensus-report\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">Analyst consensus</a> points to €6.5 billion in net income in 2025, or roughly €1.1 billion in Q4 2025 alone. Assuming a payout ratio of 50% and the €0.5 billion earmarked for share buybacks from 9M 2025 earnings, we observe that 2026 share buybacks are likely to be somewhat above €1 billion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I calculate DB should end 2025 with an EPS marginally ahead of the €2.91/share analyst consensus, with 2026 and 2027 estimates standing at €3.26/share and €3.71/share respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If current equity market levels hold firm without a correction (which is far from certain given the prevailing bullish sentiment), I see upside potential to my previous €4.00/share 2028 EPS target, largely driven by higher fees in the Asset Management segment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even if we conservatively keep 2028 estimates unchanged, we observe that DB's P/E multiple of 10.6x 2025 earnings shrinks to 9.5x in 2026, 8.3x in 2027, and 7.7x in 2028.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For reference, European financials heald in the broad EUFN trade at roughly <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239645/ishares-msci-europe-financials-etf\" rel=\"noopener\">12.4x their trailing earnings</a>, while more niche ETFs such as the iShares Stoxx Europe 600 Banks (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJXSF\" title=\"iShares Stoxx Europe 600 Banks DE\">OTC:DJXSF</a>) trade at roughly <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/uk/individual/en/products/251934/ishares-stoxx-europe-600-banks-ucits-etf-de-fund\" rel=\"noopener\">10.8x their trailing earnings</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence we observe that DB is attractively priced both relative to the broad European financials sector, as well as its direct European bank peer group. Furthermore, I believe that while all companies are naturally trying to improve returns in the future, DB's low starting base, with a ROTE target of &gt;10% in 2025, provides outsized room for profitability improvement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, I continue to belive that the opportunities outweigh the risks with DB, confirming my previous Buy rating on the shares.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As with any bank, the key risk in the investment case is a deep recession, which will weigh on credit quality and dampen business activity. With German fiscal stimulus expected to start in 2026, I see immediate recession risks as below average. Still, it is good to see DB entering 2026 with a forecast CET1 ratio of 14%, providing a cushion against unexpected losses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would add that DB's performance also remains dependent on strong capital markets activity, with the Investment Bank and Asset Management together accounting for roughly 46% of company revenues. I do expect returns to moderate substantially in 2026, although stubbornly high long-term interest rates should keep fixed income investments attractive, boosting the bank's key fixed income and currencies trading business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bank may also disappoint markets with a low profitability target, for instance targeting a ROTE of only 11% in 2028. Alternatively, an even higher ROTE target of 13% may be perceived quite positively. Taking into account profitability targets of peers, I reckon that a 13% target is somewhat more likely than a 11% ROTE target. I should caution that the higher the profitability target, the more likely it is to entail restructuring expenses, potentially pressuring earnings in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The ECB may still resort to incremental rate cuts, especially if its new staff economic projections, due to be released on<a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/calendars/mgcgc/html/index.en.html\" rel=\"noopener\"> December 18, 2025</a>, shows the Central bank undershootnig its inflation target in 2026-2028. Discussions around phasing-in carbon trading schemes, which would have boosted 2027 inflation by around 0.3%, could tip the balance towards a rate cut. M3 Money supply growth remains very weak, at only <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/stats/md/html/ecb.md2509~11beef91c7.en.html\" rel=\"noopener\">2.8% Y/Y in September 2025</a>, pointing to a benign future inflation outlook.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Deutsche Bank's Investor <a href=\"https://investor-relations.db.com/files/documents/other-presentations-and-events/2025/Investor-Deep-Dive-2025-Save-The-Date-17-November-2025.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">Deep Dive on November 17, 2025</a> will hopefully mark a continuation of the strong progress achieved by the German lender over the past few years, admitedly from a very low starting point. Deutsche Bank's solid performance was driven by internal factors such as a focused management team, but also the fastest ECB rate hiking cycle in the history of the Euro, wild market swings and elevated volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The next few years will likely bring challenges, with earnings in some years potentially falling well below rosy analyst projections. Still, my estimates show that a 12% 2028 ROTE remain attainable, with the opportunity of a 13% target arguably higher than a lackluster 11% ROTE aspiration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DB remains attractively valued relative to the broad European financials sector, as well as its immediate European bank peer group. As such, I confirm my previous Buy rating on the shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key risks in the investment case include a deep recession, weak capital markets activity, and the potential for incremental ECB rate cuts.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thank you for reading.</p>",

Over the last 12-18 months, hash rate growth has decelerated, and the Bitcoin price has hit a ceiling, but power/hardware costs have risen, making mining economics questionable.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But miners like Cipher Mining (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CIFR\" title=\"Cipher Mining Inc.\">CIFR</a></span>) have realized the overflowing demand for AI HPC workloads offers a way for them to monetize their DC (data center) infrastructure assets and expand the growth trajectories beyond the hardening economics of crypto mining.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Cipher Mining has going for itself is the intertwined relationships with itself and Alphabet that not only promise 2x revenue growth rates but also allow for secure pathways to fund its growth ramps towards those 2x growth rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We’ll get to hear from Cipher’s management this week with the Q3 ER coming up, and I suspect good things on the horizon.

Analysts are expecting Cipher Mining to report 4x and 2x growth in Q3 and Q4 of this year, implying full-year CY25 revenue growth of ~72% to revenues of $261M this year. If that happens, Cipher would deliver its first strong revenue growth since hitting a ceiling in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, with crypto mining rewards getting halved and Bitcoin prices staying stubbornly rangebound, Cipher’s management has looked towards higher asset utilization of its mining infrastructure by targeting tech companies facing capacity constraints in processing AI workloads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s where Cipher’s intertwined deal with Alphabet’s Google Cloud and Fluidstack comes in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why Google Premium Will Drive Up Revenue Growth and Shares</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In an announcement just over a month ago, Cipher Mining said that it signed a three-way partnership with Fluidstack and Alphabet’s Google.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Per the partnership, Cipher is expected to provide Fluidstack and Google 168 MW worth of DC resources via a 10-year deal that has the potential to deliver $3B in future revenues over the entirety of the contract. Google also retains two clauses to extend the contract by five years each per clause, which will add another $4B in future revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As shown below, Cipher Mining has ~477 MW of energized/operational power capacity. 207 MW is operational at Odessa, TX, and 150 MW at Wink, TX, while the company also counts its JV investments at three 40 MW crypto mining centers under its operational capacity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-17619961694245663_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2826\" data-height=\"1580\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-17619961694245663_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Exhibit B: Cipher Mining’s portfolio of operational, future and contracted DC capacity.\" width=\"640\" height=\"358\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"358\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-17619961694245663_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-17619961694245663_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-17619961694245663_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-17619961694245663_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-17619961694245663_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-17619961694245663_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-17619961694245663_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-17619961694245663_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Exhibit B: Cipher Mining’s portfolio of operational, future and contracted DC capacity. <span>(Company presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, all of Cipher’s 477 MW of operational power capacity that is already online is being distributed towards mining workloads. Based on the agreement with Google/Fluidstack, Cipher intends to offer 168 MW of the 300 MW worth of capacity from its Barber Lake, TX, location to Google and is contracted to deliver this by October of next year. This delivery is a commitment set in stone, and Cipher, under no circumstances, cannot default on this commitment. In fact, Google has even taken a 5.4% stake in Cipher Mining as part of the deal. Further, Google has also agreed to backstop $1.4B in Fluidstack’s obligations to Cipher Mining as part of the deal, giving the crypto miner strong leverage to secure financing and fast track the development of the 168 MW data center that it has to deliver to Google/Fluidstack by next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This deal is very similar to the Google/Fluidstack deal with TeraWulf (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WULF\" title=\"TeraWulf Inc.\">WULF</a>),<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829566-terawulf-google-put-groundbreaking\"> as I explained last month</a>. According to the deal’s economics, Cipher stands to benefit from $300M a year worth of revenues if one spreads out the $3B value of the deal over 10 years. (Note $3B is the minimum contract value as shown below).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59828287-17620050492479439_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1363\" data-height=\"757\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59828287-17620050492479439_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Exhibit C: How Cipher's management broke down the Google/Fluidstack deal specifics\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" contenteditable=\"true\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"355\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59828287-17620050492479439_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59828287-17620050492479439_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59828287-17620050492479439_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59828287-17620050492479439_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59828287-17620050492479439_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59828287-17620050492479439_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59828287-17620050492479439_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59828287-17620050492479439_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Exhibit C: How Cipher's management broke down the Google/Fluidstack deal specifics <span>(Company presentation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even if investors want to ignore the 10-year long-term revenue-generating horizon for Cipher, they can still see how Cipher stands to benefit from this deal over the next twelve months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Granted that Cipher won't make bank yet on the deal until the 168 MW of DC resources is delivered. But Google is already committing ~$1.4B, half of the $3B, in future revenues if Cipher can deliver the 168 MW of resources. That does represent ~$140M in annual revenues and already gives Cipher a path of at least double the revenue growth rate, incrementally, after excluding the potential revenue growth from Cipher’s mining business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a risk that Cipher defaults on the deal that I discuss below, but the risk/reward is hugely beneficial to the investor who gets to participate in Cipher’s revenue growth ahead.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Premiums Support Cipher’s AI Expansion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As stated earlier, consensus estimates peg Cipher to grow revenues by ~72% to revenues of $261M this year. Cipher currently trades at a market cap of $7.3B and records a cash position of $62.7M versus total debt &amp; obligations worth $189.3M. Therefore, on an EV/forward sales basis, Cipher appears to be trading at ~28.2x CY25 revenues, growing 72%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Markets are also projecting a similar growth rate next year of 68-70% growth. A majority of this growth is expected to continue to come from Bitcoin mining, but revenues from HPC workloads will start to trickle in by Q4 next year once Cipher delivers the 168 MW of DC resources to Google/Fluidstack, and I suspect CY26 revenue estimates will get revised higher to include some of the rent from the Google/Fluidstack partnership as we get more details over the next 12 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the moment, we can assume that Cipher is expected to grow revenues by 68-70% next year, which actually implies a forward revenue multiple of ~24-25x CY26 revenues. Even if investors want to be conservative with the CY26 revenue multiple, they can assume a forward-looking revenue multiple of ~21-22x CY26 revenues. That’s approximately the same forward multiple. Cipher’s shares briefly topped out in September after the Google/Fluidstack partnership with Cipher was announced, as shown below.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-176199611438584_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1988\" data-height=\"1310\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-176199611438584_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Exhibit C: Cipher Mining’s forward revenue multiples.\" width=\"640\" height=\"422\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"422\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-176199611438584_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-176199611438584_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-176199611438584_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-176199611438584_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-176199611438584_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-176199611438584_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-176199611438584_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/11/1/59636229-176199611438584_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span></span>Exhibit D: Cipher Mining’s forward revenue multiples. (YCharts)</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Comparing the warranted revenue multiple of 21-22x CY26 revenues vs. the current CY26 revenue multiple of 16.5x implies an upside of 29% or a PT of $21.2 per share.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks &amp; What To Look For In Next Week’s Q3 ER</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cipher could default on delivering the 168 MW of DC resources by October, and if it does so, Google &amp; Fluidstack have the option of pulling out of the deal. This is not likely to happen in my opinion because when Cipher acquired the Barber Lake site in September last year, <a href=\"https://investors.ciphermining.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cipher-mining-announces-closing-its-acquisition-barber-lake-300\" rel=\"nofollow\">it was described as a site that features</a> “front-of-the-meter capacity, a newly constructed, fully energized, high-to-mid voltage substation, and all necessary regulatory approvals.” In the same announcement, Cipher termed the site as “extremely rare” to find most of the resources and regulatory approvals in place that put management in pole position to deliver this site to Google/Fluidstack.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cipher’s capital structure might be of concern to some investors since it has $62.7M in cash versus $189.3M in total debt &amp; obligations. However, with ~$42.3M in EBITDA, the estimated gross leverage for Cipher turns out to be ~4.5x per my calculation. That is marginally elevated but still a lot more attractive than the 6.7x leverage that <a href=\"https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-rates-coreweave-proposed-new-notes-bb-rr4-21-07-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fitch estimates for CoreWeave</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With earnings expected to be announced on Monday, November 3rd, here’s what investors can expect next week:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Q3 Expectations: 11 cents per share on revenues worth $76.52M, growing 217.5% y/y</li> <li>Q4 and full-year CY25 expectations: 15 cents per share on revenues worth $94.5M, growing 124% y/y. For the full year, analysts expect 36 cents per share on revenues worth $261M, growing 72%.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cipher Mining shares look interesting as it prepares to pivot towards AI HPC workloads, just like some of Cipher’s crypto mining peers. Google’s stake and interest in Cipher Mining’s pivot strengthen the transformation into a DC player for Cipher and firm up the latter’s position as it prepares to announce Q3 earnings next week.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I initiated my buy rating on Cipher.</p>",

Also, the market<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> fervor has also helped it score remarkable gains recently over Meta Platforms (</span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">META</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">) stock, as investors in the Mark Zuckerberg-led company probed whether the company's AI CapEx spend (toward AI superintelligence?) is still justified, given the lack of near-term monetization as compared with burgeoning growth and monetization engines such as the cloud computing business of Google.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, the stunning reversal has likely caught more cautious Google investors off guard, especially those that quizzed about whether the search ads leader could struggle to compete against the onslaught linked to the AI first leaders like OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>). Yet, Google has proven that AI has always been part of its DNA, since the release of the seminal <a href=\"https://research.google/blog/transformer-a-novel-neural-network-architecture-for-language-understanding/\" rel=\"nofollow\">2017 Transformer paper</a>, that arguably laid the foundations of this AI revolution.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, it makes little sense to think that Alphabet, under the capable leadership of CEO Sundar Pichai, hasn't mounted a full stack strategic framework to help it not only to survive fears of being disrupted, but also thrive against its archrivals. These growing capabilities arise from its holistic AI pillars, consisting of hardware, chips, to AI infrastructure, and a fast growing, multi-layered cloud computing business. As a result, I believe Google has clearly allayed the market's fears, while also propping up its capabilities to assert its dominance and influence among the other top contenders for the crown in the race to determine the AI race.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Back in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4818865-alphabet-you-could-be-very-late-to-the-party-downgrade\">my last GOOGL update,</a> I expounded on my thesis about why I believe Google's antitrust case has definitively paved the way for a significant valuation re-rating, as Chrome was, after all, a critical underpinning of Google's strategy to diffuse its AI offerings. Yet, I didn't quite anticipate that the buyers have inverted extreme pessimism into the current optimism, as the volte-face has likely astounded even the most fervent of GOOGL bulls.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, it has become evident that not being compelled to divest Chrome from its properties has substantially strengthened Google's resolve to accelerate Gemini adoption across its ecosystem quickly. Note that the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835072-alphabet-inc-googl-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Gemini app now boasts an MAU</a> of 650M, scaling quickly, and catching up with OpenAI's lead that Sam Altman and his team have painstakingly built since ChatGPT was launched publicly in late 2022. And, if we believe agentic AI commerce is going to be the next pivotal game changer for e-commerce, Google's stranglehold on AI browsers is expected to be decisive. And if we consider how quickly Google has caught up with the rest of its AI peers, I don't think there's an inch of doubt that Google could close in on OpenAI's dominance, as it's not just a search advertising company.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Google Cloud's Growth Momentum Has Strengthened</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Google Cloud's renaissance, under the remarkable leadership of CEO Thomas Kurian, has also been nothing short of breathtaking, to say the least. That isn't to say that its cloud computing unit could supplant the top two hyperscalers right now; in Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) Web Services and Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) Azure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AMZN's ability to stay in front of the nascent race is aptly undergirded by its ability to monetize these capacity additions quickly, while also expected to build significant AI clusters that could run fully on its own custom chips. However, hasn't that been Google's strategy for some time already, when it comes to owning its own chip stack?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recall that <a href=\"https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ceo-scrambled-to-rescue-a-stalled-deal-from-collapse-with-openai/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenAI was reportedly closing in</a> on an arrangement with Google on their TPUs before Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) mustered a timely intervention that culminated in the announcement to invest $100B in OpenAI, as part of its multi-year build cadence. I believe Huang reckoned that keeping OpenAI well within Nvidia's orbit isn't merely strategic, but also fundamental to Nvidia's success.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hence, it's going to be a very exciting battle royale for investors of AMZN and GOOGL, as both hyperscalers slog it out to supply Anthropic with much needed capacity. The argument in favor of Google likely corresponds to its well-established prowess in its tech stack, but the company still doesn't quite possess a similar scale when compared to AWS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While AWS already boasts an operating margin of &gt;35% over the past 12 months, Google Cloud's operating margin has just crossed the 20% level in the same period.

Nonetheless, with GOOGL stock already being lifted to new highs, I think it's clear that the market has sized up its growing clout and prowess in AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The thesis of near term monetization in search has already been boosted, while the incredible growth profile for its cloud business is also undisputed, given the &gt;30% growth in the past 12 months. While the market's confidence isn't a source of contention right now, we must also be circumspect when assessing GOOGL's thesis currently, as the stock is also no longer that cheap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Note that while Cloud's contribution to Google's total operating profit has increased markedly, it still accounts for less than 10% of what the company generated from Google Services.

We can also glean the sharp valuation re-rating on the stock from the above chart over the past six months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I think that the stock's advance might not be impeded in the near term, investors who missed adding when it was still reasonably valued might want to hold back from allocating more right now. Such a dramatic rise has coincided with a substantive surge in its valuation, which I think may have been too fast and too furious. Waiting for the next pullback should help to digest some of the optimism and allow for a less risky accumulation opportunity.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rating: Maintain Hold.</p>",

This is true for almost every<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> consumer product out there.

When a quality income-producing security experiences a sell-off, we buy the dip to augment our income stream at cheaper prices. Let us now discuss two picks that have experienced a ~15% drop this year, amidst fears of lower energy prices and dropping interest rates.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pick #1: ET – Yield 7.9%</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With energy prices plunging, the midstream sector is being thrown out with the bathwater, even though this sector largely enjoys fee-based revenues, insulating them from commodity price swings. This makes quality midstream companies defensive investments in a sell-off, for investors focused on steady distributions backed by predictable cash flows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The EIA (Energy Information Administration) <a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/crude.php\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/crude.php\" target=\"_blank\">report</a> from Oct. 24 continues to show rising weekly U.S. crude oil production to 13.635 million barrels per day. The average weekly oil production in the U.S. is at all-time high levels. Produced energy commodities need to be processed, stored, and transported to refineries and end export terminals. Midstream companies operate the infrastructure for storage, processing, and other functions, including the vital arteries for secure and cost-effective distribution, while earning fees under take-or-pay or minimum-volume commitments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Energy Transfer LP (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ET\" title=\"Energy Transfer LP Common Units\">ET</a>) is one of the largest midstream companies in North America, operating more than 140,000 miles of pipeline. The company’s <a href=\"https://www.energytransfer.com/operations/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://www.energytransfer.com/operations/\" target=\"_blank\">operations</a> also include transportation, terminalling services, storage, fractionation services, and LNG regasification. In addition, ET also maintains 100% ownership in Lake Charles LNG, Sunoco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SUN\" title=\"Sunoco LP Common Units\">SUN</a>), and 39.4% ownership in USA Compression Partners (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USAC\" title=\"USA Compression Partners, LP Common Units\">USAC</a>).

Notably, 86% of the growth capital's spend ($5 billion projected for 2025) is going to be in midstream operations, NGL and refined products, and interstate natural gas transportation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With a vast geographic footprint and connections to more than 185 natural-gas-powered plants, ET is in a unique position to work at scale with companies seeking reliable energy for data center projects. The company has reported requests to connect more than 200 data centers and more than 60 power plants in its operating region, making it a beneficiary of the AI boom with long-term fee-based contracts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In July, ET made a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4471839-energy-transfer-ticks-dividend-higher-by-08-to-033\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4471839-energy-transfer-ticks-dividend-higher-by-08-to-033\" target=\"_blank\">modest raise</a> to its quarterly distribution to $0.33, which calculates to a 7.9% yield. During Q2, the partnership reported $3.89 billion in adjusted EBITDA, and $1.96 billion in distributable cash flow, out of which they distributed ~$1.5 billion to shareholders. Management expects to maintain a 3-5% annual distribution growth rate, and with significant insider ownership of ~10%, the interests of the management team align closely with those of its shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to the balance sheet, ET lags behind industry leaders due to its higher 4-4.5x leverage forecast for 2026. Nevertheless, the company’s ~8% yield backed by recurring fee-based earnings makes it more tempting amid the midstream selloff.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pick #2: SLRC – Yield 10.8%</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Every few weeks, we hear commitments and announcements from leading global corporations to invest billions in the U.S. to build manufacturing and research facilities. Expansion of such facilities requires partnerships with thousands of local suppliers and partners, which often tend to be small or mid-sized companies. Ramping up operations to bid for contracts or expand scale requires a large amount of capital.

Equipment financing is a $1.3 trillion industry and is set to grow as the U.S. continues to prioritize domestic industrial and manufacturing activity. Similarly, the <a href=\"https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/asset-based-lending-market#:~:text=The%20asset-based%20lending%20market,segment%20with%20a%2055.8%25%20share.\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/asset-based-lending-market#:~:text=The%20asset-based%20lending%20market,segment%20with%20a%2055.8%25%20share.\" target=\"_blank\">Asset-Based Lending market</a>, valued at more than $800 billion, is also set to see growth as companies seek flexible financing, backed by accounts receivable and other assets such as patents and intellectual property.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SLR Capital Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SLRC\" title=\"SLR Investment Corp.\">SLRC</a>) is a unique business development company that maintains a highly diversified portfolio of senior secured loans, largely tied to ABL and Equipment Financing. Combined, these specialty financing categories represent ~75% of the BDC’s investment mix.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on the company's <a href=\"https://slrinvestmentcorp.com/Investors/News-Releases\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://slrinvestmentcorp.com/Investors/News-Releases\" target=\"_blank\">Q2 report</a>, first-lien senior secured loans represent ~96% of the BDC’s portfolio, placing the company at the highest priority in the repayment hierarchy, enhancing the likelihood of a full recovery of principal lent. Amidst tariff and inflationary pressures, mission-critical assets, especially equipment, tend to retain their value, making them excellent collateral to underwrite against.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the <a href=\"https://slrinvestmentcorp.com/Investors/News-Releases\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener noopener\" title=\"https://slrinvestmentcorp.com/Investors/News-Releases\" target=\"_blank\">end of Q2</a>, SLRC’s portfolio comprised loans made to 940 unique issuers across 110 industries, with its average exposure at just $3.5 million (0.1%) per issuer. The <a href=\"https://slrinvestmentcorp.com/Investors/News-Releases\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"https://slrinvestmentcorp.com/Investors/News-Releases\" target=\"_blank\">BDC reported</a> record ABL originations during the second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue in the Q3 performance. Net portfolio activity (originations minus repayments) in the ABL segment was $225.6 million, followed by Life Science Financing at $27.8 million. Equipment financing and Sponsor financing saw greater repayments than originations, but the former had $141.2 million in originations, the majority associated with leases tied to investment-grade corporate borrowers. SLRC ended Q2 with just one investment in non-accrual status, representing 0.3% of the BDC’s portfolio at fair value, immunizing the company's financials from the broader fears of credit deterioration.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SLRC began Q2 with its leverage at 1.04x, while ending the quarter at 1.17x. This boosted leverage was instrumental in supporting the record originations ($567 million of new investments), which management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4809550-slr-investment-corp-slrc-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4809550-slr-investment-corp-slrc-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">noted</a> as largely closed towards the end of the second quarter. With $387 million in repayments, SLRC reported net portfolio growth of $180 million during the quarter, and many new loans that hadn’t begun making payments yet. As such, the BDC’s NII came in at $0.40/share for Q2, shy of its $0.41/share dividend, but the outlook is strong for stable dividend coverage. SLRC maintains more than $600 million in liquidity available for deployment, and is well positioned to participate in the upcoming surge in domestic projects as interest rates continue to drop.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Markets are going to move up and down. That is inherently how financial institutions are designed to operate. There are buyers and sellers, and negative news often triggers the seller in most of us more than the buyer.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At High Dividend Opportunities, we specialize in turning market fear into opportunities for passive income. When on sale, we buy fundamentally sound companies with recurring cash flows. ET and SLRC are just two examples of investments that are paying us handsomely to stay patient while others react emotionally. We don’t trade in fear; we collect income through it and reinvest to buy more. Turning volatility into opportunity – this is the beauty of our Income Method!</p>",

Smith (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AOS\" title=\"A. O. Smith Corporation\">AOS</a>) increased its dividend rate from $0.34 to $0.36, a 5.88% increase. The new rate takes effect in Q4 and translates to 6.15% dividend growth for the stock in calendar year 2025. For context, in 2024, AOS increased its dividend at a rate of 6.56%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Brown &amp; Brown (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRO\" title=\"Brown &amp; Brown, Inc.\">BRO</a>) increased its dividend rate from $0.15 to $0.165, a 10% increase. The new rate takes effect in Q4 and translates to 13.89% dividend growth for the stock in calendar year 2025. For context, in 2024 BRO increased its dividend at a rate of 13.68%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">McDonalds (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD\" title=\"McDonald's Corporation\">MCD</a>) increased its dividend rate from $1.77 to $1.86, a 5.08% increase. The new rate takes effect in Q4 and translates to 5.75% dividend growth for the stock in calendar year 2025. For context, in 2024, MCD increased its dividend at a rate of 8.83%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, the average dividend growth rate for the Aristocrats in 2025 stands at 5.27%. With 12 more dividend increases expected this year, and likely even more since Realty Income (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/O\" title=\"Realty Income Corporation\">O</a>) has historically raised its dividend rate each quarter, the Aristocrats are very close to delivering higher dividend growth in 2025 compared to 2024, when the growth rate was 5.78%. It will come down to the wire but my guess would is that dividend growth in 2025 will not exceed the prior year.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span

not all of them are equally attractive investment opportunities at the moment. To identify the most promising Aristocrats, I focus on two key metrics: potential undervaluation and projected long-term total return.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation is assessed using dividend yield theory, which compares the current dividend yield to the 5-year rolling average. Potential long-term return is calculated as the sum of expected future earnings growth, the forward dividend yield, and a potential boost from mean reversion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of October 29th, 30 Dividend Aristocrats appear to be both potentially undervalued and have a long-term annualized expected rate of return of at least 10%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These Aristocrats were identified with a long-term focus, based on current valuation and estimated future growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here they are:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive

After all, or so I thought, would there be that big of a difference between the two? Well, the big difference between the two has come in the form of the sector-leading performance the SMHX ETF has generated over the past year (see chart below). As you know, fabless semiconductor companies operate an asset-light business in that they design &amp; sell semiconductor chips but outsource the semiconductor fabrication to companies that have the expertise to operate the complex &amp; capital-intensive foundries that actually produce the chips. That being the case, the fabless business model certainly has some distinct advantages.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After completing my analysis (see below), I have come to the conclusion that the SMHX ETF is a BUY and should be considered as a core long-term technology holding in an otherwise well-diversified portfolio.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a3515c08974fa72e10ff7e8e3e254231.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a3515c08974fa72e10ff7e8e3e254231.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a3515c08974fa72e10ff7e8e3e254231.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a3515c08974fa72e10ff7e8e3e254231.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a3515c08974fa72e10ff7e8e3e254231.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a3515c08974fa72e10ff7e8e3e254231.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a3515c08974fa72e10ff7e8e3e254231.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a3515c08974fa72e10ff7e8e3e254231.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_a3515c08974fa72e10ff7e8e3e254231.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see in the graphic above, the SMHX ETF has not only outperformed its sister fund SMH by a significant margin over the past year (by 7.6%), but has even more significantly outperformed the Fidelity Select Semiconductor ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FSELX\" title=\"Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio\">FSELX</a>) and the broad Philadelphia Semiconductor sector (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SOX\" title=\"Philadelphia Semiconductor Index\">SOX</a>).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Thesis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is no doubt that global semiconductor sales are on fire:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"839\" data-height=\"636\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"August 2025 Global Semiconductor Revenue\" width=\"640\" height=\"485\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"485\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761853046831171_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Semiconductor Industry Association</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see from the graphic above, global <a href=\"https://www.semiconductors.org/global-semiconductor-sales-increase-21-7-year-to-year-in-august/\" rel=\"nofollow\">semiconductor sales in August</a> were $64.9 billion and were +21.7% yoy and were +4.4% as compared to the July 2025 total of $62.1 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, the foundry model enables fabless semiconductor companies to focus on chip architecture and cutting-edge circuit design without incurring the significant cap-ex and risks associated with operating leading-edge fabrication facilities. By partnering with semiconductor foundries, fabless semiconductor companies can gain access to leading-edge design nodes without the hassle of &amp; costs associated with in-house logistics and production.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fabless semiconductor/foundry partnership model has been a grand success over the past few decades to the great benefit of the entire semiconductor industry because it enables all companies involved to focus on what they do best. That being the case, fabless semiconductor companies have two succinct advantages: cost-efficiency &amp; flexibility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the \"flexibility\" factor has arguably shrunk dramatically over the past few years because one company (Taiwan Semiconductor) has come to absolutely dominate the high-performance leading-edge of semiconductor manufacturing technology that is critical when it comes to delivering the high-speed, low-power technology required for today's AI processors and high-speed networking equipment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Obviously, a fabless semiconductor ETF like SMHX will <em>not</em> give investors exposure to some of the leading foundries like Taiwan Semiconductor (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>), GlobalFoundries (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GFS\" title=\"GlobalFoundries Inc.\">GFS</a>), Micron Technology (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU\" title=\"Micron Technology, Inc.\">MU</a>), SK Hynix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HXSCF\" title=\"SK hynix Inc.\">OTCPK:HXSCF</a>), and Intel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC\" title=\"Intel Corporation\">INTC</a>) - among others. Indeed, the lack of TSMC in the portfolio was the primary factor that I did not invest in SMHX when it first came out, and instead chose to simply add to my existing full-position in the SMH ETF. In hindsight, that was an error on my part.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that as background, let's take a closer look at the SMHX ETF, starting with the portfolio.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top 10 Holdings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The top 10 holdings in the SMHX ETF are shown below and were taken directly from the <a href=\"https://www.vaneck.com/us/en/investments/fabless-semiconductor-etf-smhx/overview/\" rel=\"noopener\">VanEck SMHX ETF webpage</a>, where you can find more detailed information on the fund:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"666\" data-height=\"597\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SMHX ETF Top-10 Holdings\" width=\"640\" height=\"574\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"574\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-1761829888852193_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>VanEck</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see from the graphic, the top three holdings - which in aggregate equate to 41% of the entire portfolio - are composed of the three leading providers of AI compute engines: NVIDIA (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>), Broadcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>), and AMD (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>).

That said, the timing could not have been better, and the performance of the ETF so far has been exceptional and better than its sister fund SMH and the broad semiconductor sector as well, which are represented in the chart below by the Fidelity Select Semiconductor Portfolio (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FSELX\" title=\"Fidelity Select Semiconductors Portfolio\">FSELX</a>), the iShares Semiconductor ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SOXX\" title=\"iShares Semiconductor ETF\">SOXX</a>), and the Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SOXQ\" title=\"Invesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF\">SOXQ</a>):</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-17618505511290412_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"711\" data-height=\"265\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-17618505511290412_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SMHX ETF Performance\" width=\"640\" height=\"239\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"239\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-17618505511290412_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-17618505511290412_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-17618505511290412_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-17618505511290412_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-17618505511290412_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-17618505511290412_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-17618505511290412_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/173432-17618505511290412_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>VanEck</span></p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c5bc00a949e5cd7f986488ec94d913cd.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c5bc00a949e5cd7f986488ec94d913cd.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c5bc00a949e5cd7f986488ec94d913cd.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c5bc00a949e5cd7f986488ec94d913cd.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c5bc00a949e5cd7f986488ec94d913cd.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c5bc00a949e5cd7f986488ec94d913cd.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c5bc00a949e5cd7f986488ec94d913cd.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c5bc00a949e5cd7f986488ec94d913cd.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c5bc00a949e5cd7f986488ec94d913cd.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Basic ETF Metrics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I do with all my Seeking Alpha articles on ETFs, here are some of the basic ETF metrics any investor might consider before allocating any capital to the SMHX fund:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Expense ratio: 0.35%</li> <li>AUM: 170.8 million</li> <li># of holdings: 23</li> <li>12-month yield: 0.03%</li> <li>TTM P/E = <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SMHX/\" rel=\"nofollow\">46.7x</a> </li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SMHX has the same expense ratio as its sister fund SMH, which is on the high side and more than I typically like to pay for an ETF. However, you can't argue with the returns, so I put up with it (on SMH, I don't yet own SMHX but am considering a stake in the fund).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see from the assets-under-management, SMHX is still a relatively small fund (in comparison, SMH has $37.1 billion in assets). That's a double-edged sword in my opinion: if there's a big market sell-off, there could be liquidity issues if investors all rush for the door at the same time. On the other hand, if money were to move into the fund in significant volume, it could result in concentrated buying in the fund's small number of holdings that might actually be a bullish factor. Meantime, as you can see from the TTM P/E ratio, SMHX is trading at a significant premium to the S&amp;P500 (<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SMHX/\" rel=\"nofollow\">P/E=32x</a>).</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The semiconductor sector is trading at a lofty valuation level due to the extremely bullish fundamentals of hyperscalers (and others) spending—in aggregate—$100's of billions of dollars annually on the AI data center buildout. Many analysts say we are in an \"AI bubble\" that could pop. I don't see that happening any time soon, but that doesn't mean it couldn't or that it one day won't. It could come about via the lack of electrical power capacity, so-called \"circular financing\" gone awry, or the ROE on AI simply not meeting expectations that eventually lead to a slowdown in new AI data center capacity being built.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My own opinion is that the hyperscalers funding this \"hype\" are cash-rich and generating tons of free cash flow and are therefore funding their AI capex from the tremendously profitable platforms they are already operating. If you think I am smoking something, I suggest you take a look at Google's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) <a href=\"https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/2025q3-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Q3 earnings report</a>. Absolutely fantastic and exactly what I predicted in my recent widely-read Seeking Alpha article, \"<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4830520-alphabet-the-ai-leader-openai-is-still-chasing\">Google: The AI Leader OpenAI Is Still Chasing (And Will Never Catch)\"</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My point here is that the so-called \"AI hype\" has staying power because none of the leading hyperscalers want to stop investing and run the risk of falling behind. META, for instance, is doubling-down on its arguably large AI infrastructure spending. That may be because its CEO Mark Zuckerberg might realize that META's own foundational model (Llama) arguably isn't up to snuff as compared to Google's Gemini+, OpenAI's ChatGPT, or Anthropic's Claude.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regardless, I think - barring some kind of geopolitical disaster (which is certainly possible these days ...) - we're good-to-go at least thru the end of calendar year 2026. There will certainly be humps-n-bumps along the road, but in my opinion, the AI technology revolution is going to last for the rest of our lives.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary &amp; Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My followers know that I advise investors to build a well-diversified portfolio on the foundation of a high-quality, low-cost S&amp;P500 ETF (like VOO) and to overweight that portfolio with technology stocks. I've written before on Seeking Alpha that the SMH semiconductor ETF should be considered as a core long-term holding in such a portfolio (it is in mine). If you don't already own SMH, you might consider the SMHX instead, or perhaps split your semiconductor allocation between the two ETFs. Heck, I already have a full-position in the SMH ETF, and instead of continually adding to it, I have decided to funnel future semiconductor funds into the SMHX ETF instead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, I know it's hard to invest money at lofty valuation levels. That being the case, I will give the same advice I have been giving with respect to my other primary AI single stock holdings like Google &amp; Broadcom: start by opening a small \"starter position\" (even if it is only 5 or 10 shares ...) and begin learning about the stock (or fund) by watching how it trades and by reading the quarterly earnings reports and listening to the conference calls. Over time, you will become an expert on the company and/or ETF. Then you will be much better prepared to take advantage of market volatility to add to your position during market sell-offs. Speaking for myself, during times of market turmoil I have always found it easier to add to an existing position as compared to opening a brand new one. Last piece of advice: be patient. It took me over 2 years to build a full position in Broadcom, but it was certainly worth the time and the work.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom line: I like the SMHX ETF and rate it a BUY based on my expectations that we are still in the early innings of what I see as a long-term secular bull market in the technology sector. And within the technology sector, semiconductors are the key to ... well<em> ... everything</em>.</p>",

The founders, two Lehman acolytes, earned a name for themselves by identifying market shifts early and converting them into profitable strategies. Today, Blackstone is the world's largest alternative asset manager, with assets under management (AUM) surpassing $1.2 trillion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Historically, betting against Blackstone has not been a profitable strategy. The same foresight that has made the firm successful in the past is underpinning their expansion in private credit and insurance. Despite this, many investors incorrectly price Blackstone as a traditional private equity (PE) shop. Unlike some peers that remain vulnerable to market swings and tethered to interest rate fluctuations, Blackstone is now generating the majority of its revenue from recurring fees, a durable and scalable income stream. This pivot from the traditional PE model, expansion in the C&amp;I operation, along with investment in non-REIT related projects, (e.g. infrastructure, and AI), are driving growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expanding A Proven System To Credit And Insurance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since Blackstone’s 2008 acquisition of GSO Capital Partners, the firm has been building out its credit related investment business. From 2008 to 2020, the subsidiary had grown from around $10 billion in assets to more than $135 billion in assets. In 2023, Blackstone integrated the credit and insurance groups into a streamlined operation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, BXCI <a href=\"https://www.blackstone.com/our-businesses/credit-and-insurance-bxci/\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Blackstone Credit and Insurance)</a> represents AUM of over $508 billion, and generated about $36 billion of the $54 billion in total Q3 inflows. By blending multiple verticals, BXCI has become the firm’s fastest growing segment, doubling AUM in the past three years. Due to Blackstone’s sheer size and existing international footprint, BXCI was able to build on an existing infrastructure that peers can’t easily replicate. While most peers rely on smaller networks, and secondary markets, BXCI has a network of over 5,000 issuers, and 550 sponsors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BXCI’s strength is rooted in its insurance partnerships, including Corebridge Financial, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRBG\" title=\"Corebridge Financial, Inc.\">CRBG</a>), Legal &amp; General Group Plc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LGGNY\" title=\"Legal &amp; General Group Plc\">OTCPK:LGGNY</a>) and Everlake (privately held). These relationships provide a steady source of long-term capital, allowing BXCI to invest consistently across different market conditions. By centralizing existing credit and insurance units under one umbrella, the firm is able to offer clients a one-stop solution. The effectiveness of this model is reflected in the numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BXCI has zero realized losses to date and accounted for nearly two-thirds of Q3 inflows to Blackstone this year. BXCI products such as Blackstone Secured Lending Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BXSL\" title=\"Blackstone Secured Lending Fund.\">BXSL</a>), and <a href=\"https://www.bcred.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blackstone Private Credit Fund</a> (BCRED) have consistently outperformed industry benchmarks, such as the Morningstar LSTA US <a href=\"https://indexes.morningstar.com/indexes/details/morningstar-lsta-us-leveraged-loan-FS0000HS4A?currency=USD&amp;variant=TR&amp;tab=overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leveraged Loan Index</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Drypowder And Capital Deployment</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Blackstone’s dry powder stores are estimated to be between $188 and $200 billion, nearly double peers KKR &amp; Co. Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KKR\" title=\"KKR &amp; Co. Inc.\">KKR</a>) (~$105 billion), Apollo Global Management, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APO\" title=\"Apollo Global Management, Inc.\">APO</a>) (~$75 billion), and Carlyle Group Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CG\" title=\"The Carlyle Group Inc.\">CG</a>) (~$90 billion). Blackstone represents nearly <em>10% of dry powder stores across the entire private equity industry</em>, granting them a unique capability to invest in deals that smaller players couldn’t access or afford. Blackstone has focused this capital deployment on high-growth sectors independent of rate cuts. Among these is their investment in AI and digital infrastructure.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Blackstone has positioned itself as a leading investor in the AI revolution, with <a href=\"https://www.blackstone.com/insights/article/the-convergence-of-data-centers-and-power-a-generational-investment-opportunity/\" rel=\"nofollow\">over $70 billion committed</a> to data centers. The firm is also deploying capital around the margins of this new economy to maximize upside, including energy generation, and cooling systems. Additionally, Blackstone’s expansion in high-growth sectors such as Healthcare, and logistics offers less reliance on their real estate investments. For example, on October 21st, <a href=\"https://investors.hologic.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Hologic-to-be-Acquired-by-Blackstone-and-TPG-for-up-to-79-per-Share/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blackstone announced</a> its $18.3 billion acquisition of Hologic, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HOLX\" title=\"Hologic, Inc.\">HOLX</a>). This further expansion into healthcare and medical technology was enabled by their access to capital. Hologic’s existing stable cash flow and high-profit margins will be a welcome addition to Blackstone’s balance sheet, and the long-term growth potential of Hologic will be leveraged by increased R&amp;D investment. This summer saw the creation of a dedicated secondaries unit to complement Blackstone’s Strategic Partners group. This will give additional capabilities to this growing part of the business, which just closed a <a href=\"https://www.blackstone.com/news/press/blackstone-strategic-partners-closes-largest-infrastructure-secondaries-fund-ever-raised-at-5-5-billion/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">$5.5 billion infrastructure fund</a>. <a href=\"https://www.blackstone.com/news/press/blackstone-strategic-partners-closes-largest-infrastructure-secondaries-fund-ever-raised-at-5-5-billion/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SP Infrastructure IV</a> is the world’s largest dedicated infrastructure secondaries fund designed to capitalize on the growing infrastructure secondary market by providing an avenue for investors to sell or restructure existing infrastructure assets. Infrastructure AUM (industry-wide) is <a href=\"https://www.moneymanagement.com.au/news/funds-management/global-infrastructure-aum-hit-us187t-2026?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">expected to reach</a> $1.8 trillion by 2026, providing a large base for secondary market growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Divergence In Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the high-rate environment, Blackstone continues to outperform. <a href=\"https://s23.q4cdn.com/714267708/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Blackstone3Q25EarningsPressRelease.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">In Q3 alone</a>, distributable earnings saw a 48% YoY jump to $1.89 billion. As the private equity space faced years of muted activity in the IPO market, higher interest rates, and a 25% YoY decline in fundraising, Blackstone has managed to thrive, generating $225 billion in total inflows (TTM). To understand the value, it’s key to dig deeper into the stable and recurring revenue streams. Fee-Related Earnings (FRE) are the most reliable tool to measure the underlying business because of their link to AUM. The stability of these revenue streams is a great advantage for Blackstone, offering annuity-like consistency, rather than one-off windfalls. As of last week’s Q3, 2025 release, Blackstone has seen fee-related earnings (FRE) surpass $1.5 billion. Additionally, compared with Apollo (16.7%), Ares (13.4%), and KKR (7.5%), Blackstone has the highest ROE at 26.5%, showing the scalability of their current business model. On the earnings front, Blackstone has diluted EPS growth of 19.5%, and a higher forward dividend yield (3.46%) than Ares (2.98%), Apollo (1.63%), and KKR (0.62%). In price volatility, the 24-month beta (1.43) is below Apollo (1.84), and KKR (1.96). Among major asset managers, Blackstone has managed to maximize ROE, net income margins, and EPS growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Should rate cuts happen at a slower pace, or if inflation flares up, Blackstone (like most of the market) would likely see stock prices stall, and lower than anticipated earnings. Another thing worth watching is BREIT redemptions. While stable at the moment, the housing market pressure persists. Rising competition is also something that warrants caution, especially as peers such as Ares and KKR build up their own C&amp;I operations. Blackstone has the size and diversification working in its favor, but like any company, it’s not immune from market forces, and smaller firms can potentially erode profit margins.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Blackstone has managed to move beyond its early LBO, and M&amp;A shop days, becoming an integrated private equity, credit, insurance, and real estate behemoth. In recent years a pivot away from its traditional revenue model to the current fee-based structure has generated compounding value for clients and shareholders alike. With lower rates expected, BXCI’s AUM growing at 20% YoY, $180+ billion in dry powder ready to deploy, and its leading role in the AI revolution, 2026 brings opportunity for Blackstone to accelerate growth and earnings. Based on these factors, we see Blackstone hitting a price of at least $185 by Q3, 2026, representing upside of around 24% from current levels.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At Avalon Capital Research: we rate Blackstone Inc. a BUY.</p>",

So, <span></span>Smurfit Westrock attributes 50 basis points of its decline to the value-over-volume strategy. The company is progressing in shutting down production capacity linked to non-performing mills and has already closed three paper mills. Indeed, top management reported: \"further reduction in the number of corrugated loss makers and continuing rationalization of inefficient capacity<em>.\" </em>The adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.2% is a positive sign. More importantly, <span></span>Smurfit Westrock's adjusted EBITDA accelerated on a quarterly basis, signing a plus +7% versus +3% yearly.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Supportive Synergies Ahead</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a negative note, the company reduced its fiscal year 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $4.9–5.1 billion (compared to a previous indication range of $5-5.2 billion - Fig. 4). This implied an adjusted EBITDA of $1.23 billion in Q4 2025 at the midpoint. Still, the company remains on track to deliver $400 million in synergies. During the analyst's call, top management explained that the cut is related to the weak US demand and higher maintenance ($180-200 million versus last year).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1842\" data-height=\"620\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SW new guidance\" width=\"640\" height=\"215\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644606358159_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SW new guidance</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fig 4</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global Footprint As A Key <span>Differentiator</span> </h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a global leader with a footprint in the EU and LatAm, the company benefits from diversification. The company's press release very well supports this: \"We believe we are one of the market leaders in EMEA and APAC, where we have once again demonstrated good returns despite a difficult market backdrop to deliver Adjusted EBITDA of $419 million with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.8%.\" EU mills are operating at a full utilization rate. <span>The company also disclosed its 2026 CAPEX guidance before the year-end. This is unusual, but we see a positive take here. 2026 CAPEX is estimated to be close to consensus guidance at ~$2.4 billion. Still, on a positive note, the company confirmed its quarterly dividend payment of $0.4308 per share (Fig. 5). </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1864\" data-height=\"852\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SW Capital allocation priorities\" width=\"640\" height=\"293\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617644326359615_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SW Capital allocation priorities</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fig 5</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here at the Lab, we are deliberately not modeling a volume recovery or improved synergies in 2026. We had previously set 2025 EBITDA at $5 billion, which is now consistent with management’s estimates. We were not insensitive to Mondi's profit warning, so we incorporated short-term challenges, but this share price evolution supports doubling down on our entry price. We apply no change to our EV/EBITDA target multiple (8x), so <span></span>Smurfit Westrock's enterprise value reached $40 billion. Our EV/EBITDA is below Packaging Corp. of America's and Smurfit Kappa's valuation before the merger with <span></span>Westrock. Additionally, our target price is below the sector median with a TTM EBITDA of 9.99x (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SW/valuation/metrics\">Fig. 6</a>). Considering the current financial obligation, the company's equity value reached $26.5 billion. This represents approximately a 35% upside. There is also a 4.5% dividend yield, which is a total return estimate of almost 40% in one year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"686\" data-height=\"824\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA Valuation Data\" width=\"640\" height=\"769\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/51181085-17617643383400013_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SA Valuation Data</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fig 6</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is subject to similar risks as the rest of the paper and packaging sector, such as FX changes (which are relevant given Smurfit <span></span>Westrock's US industrial footprint and its euro reporting), declining consumer activity given a potential economic slowdown, COGS price changes (raw materials, energy prices, and chemicals), wage inflation, changes in packaging trends, and overcapacity.

We’re surprised by the adverse share reaction and are upgrading Smurfit to a Strong Buy Recommendation. This call is not only based on a discounted valuation, but rather on the best opportunity to invest in what we consider the best-managed company in the paper sector.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VRRM\" title=\"Verra Mobility Corporation\">VRRM</a></span>) previously with a buy rating, as the business outlook remains positive, and given the valuation has become cheaper, I stayed bullish. For this update, I maintain a buy rating. My<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> view is still that this is a strong, well-managed business that is seeing fundamentals improving. VRRM has won the NYCDOT contract, which removes a huge uncertainty in the equity story. With new potential growth levers like new legislation changes in California, I would think VRRM is still in very good shape to grow for the foreseeable future.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3Q25 Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285135-verra-mobility-announces-third-quarter-2025-financial-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A1\">Q3 2025</a> results were very strong. VRRM’s total revenue grew 16% y/y to $262 million, coming in way ahead of consensus. The beat was almost entirely driven by Government Solutions [GS], which saw 28% y/y growth. The key catalyst was the timing and pull-forward of the New York City contract. In Q3, VRRM booked $17 million of revenue tied to a New York City Department of Transportation [NYCDOT] change order to install up to 250 additional red-light cameras in 2025. In that $17 million, it included $6 million from product sales. Remember that I’ve discussed this previously, noting this as a growth catalyst. It has surely played out nicely and as expected. For the Commercial Services [CS] segment, revenue grew 7% y/y to $117.3 million. The 3% decline in Fleet Management [FMC] was expected, as the customer churn was already disclosed in Q2 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of profit, adj. EBITDA grew 8% y/y to $113 million. This was below revenue growth because of one-time readiness costs tied to the NYC expansion. Some of the major cost items include developing a real-time camera health dashboard, cloud migration, and getting more subcontractor capacity onboard. These are necessary upfront investments to make sure VRRM is ready to win demand (like the $963 million contract opportunity), and hence, they shouldn’t be considered as recurring costs. Anyway, despite the heavier spend, adj. EPS still grew 16% y/y to $0.37.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The NYC Overhang Is Gone</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The outcome of the NYCDOT RFP was a very bullish moment for VRRM’s equity story. As I said before, this was an important growth catalyst, which could also be seen as an overhang (investors don’t like uncertainty). Thankfully, that uncertainty is now gone, and VRRM has been officially awarded the contract. What makes this even better than it seems is that this is not just a simple renewal. It is actually a large expansion contract with multi-year visibility. Here are the terms of the deal: the VRRM contract is on a five-year term with a five-year renewal option. In other words, VRRM has effectively locked in its largest customer for potentially a decade. The total estimated value for the initial term alone is $963 million. For perspective, VRRM's entire FY2024 revenue is only $879 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The scope of this deal is also very positive for VRRM. It includes the sale and installation of ~1,000 additional red-light and fixed bus-lane cameras over the next 2+ years. This matters for two reasons. First, it gives VRRM a sizeable sum of front-loaded, high-margin product revenue (NYCDOT has chosen to purchase the equipment directly from VRRM), which management expects will contribute $20 million to $30 million in product revenue in both 2026 and 2027. Second, and more importantly, this permanently expands the VRRM recurring revenue base. Each of these 1,000 cameras represents a long-term service stream that generates visible, high-margin revenue. Basically, the installed base has gotten significantly larger, and a larger installed base means more recurring revenue. Given this win, I think the GS segment can very easily grow high-single-digit to low-double-digit service revenue through the foreseeable future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Execution, Balance Sheet, And Growth Momentum</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beyond the NYC contract win, the rest of VRRM business continues to execute exceptionally well too. The CS segment continues to operate steadily, maintaining its status as the cash-generative engine for VRRM. In Q3, revenue grew 7% y/y, supported by a 7% increase in rental-car tolling activity. The key data point here is that TSA passenger traffic grew by only 1% in Q3, which means the growth was not a boost from higher travel-related passengers. This reliable cash flow provides VRRM the flexibility to deleverage quickly (net leverage is now down to just 2x). On this balance sheet topic, management has refinanced the term loan, extending its maturity by seven years to 2032 and cutting the spread by 25 bps. The focus here on balance sheet matters to some extent because the NYC contract win is good, but it requires heavy investments. The last thing we want to see is VRRM being put in a difficult position where it needs to raise debt or equity to fund this growth capex.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth momentum in GS, which I highlighted in my last update, is also accelerating. Specifically, for California’s speed camera program, which was still in its six-city pilot phase previously, VRRM has won its third award, with San Jose confirming its intent to award. With this win, it marks VRRM's third win following the deals in San Francisco and Oakland. You can start to see this trend forming nicely, that as VRRM wins more deals, it makes it more credible in the industry. Every win becomes a reference point for the next deal. I would love to think that this is the case, and if true, we should continue to see VRRM winning deals on this front.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Winning these deals is not just good for the financial benefits, but also because VRRM gains a “priority” seat when it comes to more services needed. Take the recent California legislation, for instance. The new legislation doesn’t just require a new work-zone speed pilot but also a complete restructuring of California’s red-light program, moving it from criminal to civil enforcement. This is huge because the 'criminal' term was a major operating barrier; in a sense, it was a political headache for cities to adopt due to high fines and the related legal process for drivers. This new change shifts the status from criminal to a simple civil penalty (just think of this like a parking ticket). This makes the program far easier to adopt for municipalities (they don’t need to go through the high hurdles of passing a “criminal law”), and this, in my view, should significantly accelerate adoption. For VRRM, because it is already in contract with California, it should naturally be the vendor of choice.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"780\" data-height=\"403\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A white sheet with numbers and a number on it AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"331\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59531952-17618821434292002_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>May Investing Ideas</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My updated model still suggests attractive upside for VRRM. My growth assumptions are the same: that revenue growth should continue to compound at a high single-digit percentage given the new NYC contract win and expanding opportunities in California and potentially other states. In fact, my growth assumption may be too low, but for conservatism's sake, I will stick to 8%. I have delayed VRRM achieving a 25% adj. earnings margin by 1 year to FY28 to reflect the heavy investments required for the NYC deal. One new change to the model is I am pricing in share buybacks. So far into FY2025, VRRM has already bought back 3% of shares, and I assume this to continue as VRRM has the balance sheet strength to continue. This gives us an FY28 adj. EPS of $2.05. Multiplying that by 18x forward PE (VRRM historical average multiple), I think VRRM shares can be worth $37 by FY2027.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risk</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main risk is from the front-loaded margin pressure from the new NYC contract. Management expects to see some margin pressure in 2026, and should the required expenses go beyond expectations, the unit economics of this contract may not be as lucrative. The deal also increases customer concentration risk. In Q3 2025, NYCDOT accounted for 19.5% of total revenue, and the top three CS clients represented more than 38%. Should any of them churn, for any reason, it would be detrimental for VRRM.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I reiterate a buy rating for VRRM. I believe VRRM’s fundamentals have gotten a lot better after the NYC contract award, one that enables it to lock in its largest customer for the next decade. The balance sheet is stronger, cash flow remains robust, and new legislative tailwinds are potentially expanding VRRM’s addressable market. While 2026 will see near-term margin pressure from upfront costs, I believe these investments will support higher growth and profitability in 2027 and beyond.</p>",

And I expect its margins to<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> grow faster than analysts expect, which means that the stock is potentially undervalued based on earnings multiples. Additionally, BJ’s can use its increased income to drive EPS growth in other ways, such as stock buybacks.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I discussed this thesis in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4816157-bjs-restaurants-might-become-more-efficient-than-analysts-expect\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4816157-bjs-restaurants-might-become-more-efficient-than-analysts-expect\" target=\"_blank\">my previous article about BJ’s</a>, but my call may have been too early. I recommended buying the stock at $35 per share in August, and its closing price on October 30 was $29. It appears that investors liked the third-quarter report, and after it came out, BJ’s stock price rose to $31 in post-market trading. But it might still take more time for this stock to rise back to $35.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20287298-bj-s-restaurants-inc-reports-fiscal-third-quarter-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20287298-bj-s-restaurants-inc-reports-fiscal-third-quarter-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" target=\"_blank\">its third-quarter report</a>, BJ’s reported 0.5% same-store sales growth and 1.4% overall revenue growth. It also reported $330.2 million in revenue and $0.04 in adjusted diluted EPS. It’s maintaining its guidance for 2% same-store sales growth for the full year of 2025, and early fourth-quarter trends are promising. Its third-quarter results were weaker than expected, but the restaurant does have a good explanation for this. It was facing tougher comps because of the launch of the Pizookie Meal Deal last year. But first, I’ll take a look at BJ’s margins.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">BJ’s Margins Are Still Growing</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My investment thesis for BJ’s depends on margin expansion, and BJ’s did report additional margin growth during the third quarter. Its restaurant-level operating margin rose from 11.7% in the third quarter of 2024 to 12.5% in the third quarter of 2025. Its adjusted EBITDA margin also improved to 6.4% in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The restaurant’s unadjusted bottom-line results also improved. It posted an unadjusted loss of $2.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, and an unadjusted profit of $465 million in the third quarter of 2025. It was only able to post positive GAAP net income because of tax benefits, though. It reported an EBIT of -$999 million. Either way, BJ’s is becoming more efficient right now, so that part of the thesis still holds up.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Full-Year 2025 Forecast</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BJ’s maintained its guidance for 2% same-store sales growth for the full year in the earnings report, but didn’t provide overall revenue guidance. Because the company’s revenue growth as a whole has been slightly higher than its same-store sales growth, I’d estimate that its full-year revenue could rise 3% to $1.398 billion for the full year of 2025. I don’t expect it to add any new locations in the fourth quarter of 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the third-quarter earnings report, BJ’s said that its revenue for the first <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"three\" htloopnumber=\"523114578\">three</em> quarters of 2025 was $1.044 billion. So, using the company’s full-year guidance, I can estimate that its fourth-quarter 2025 revenue will be $354 million. Its guidance also called for $136 million in full-year adjusted EBITDA at the midpoint, and with $1.398 billion in revenue, that’s a 9.7% margin. So, with $354 million in revenue, its fourth-quarter adjusted EBITDA would be $34 million.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pizookies Are Still The Growth Driver for BJ’s</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While BJ’s posted weaker top-line results this quarter, this wasn’t just because of economic weakness. <a href=\"https://www.dailynews.com/2024/09/10/bjs-restaurant-launches-a-13-pizookie-meal-deal/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.dailynews.com/2024/09/10/bjs-restaurant-launches-a-13-pizookie-meal-deal/\" target=\"_blank\">BJ’s introduced the Pizookie Meal Deal</a> in the third quarter of 2024, so it was facing a tougher-than-usual comparison. This $13 lunch deal includes both an entree and a Pizookie, a cookie topped with ice cream. And it’s the reason why BJ’s still has positive traffic growth right now. <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BJRI/earnings/BJRI-Q3-2025-earnings_call-369389.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BJRI/earnings/BJRI-Q3-2025-earnings_call-369389.html\" target=\"_blank\">On the call</a>, management said that traffic growth drove the restaurant’s same-store sales growth in the third quarter. Its average check size isn’t increasing and might have dropped a bit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This restaurant also offers seasonal Pizookie treats, such as <a href=\"https://www.brandeating.com/2025/09/bjs-restaurant-brewhouse-2025-halloween-menu.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.brandeating.com/2025/09/bjs-restaurant-brewhouse-2025-halloween-menu.html\" target=\"_blank\">the Spooky Pizookie</a>, which was originally introduced in 2023 and has now been brought back for 2025. On the call, management also said that BJ’s has more seasonal Pizookies coming up in the fourth quarter, including the Monkey Bread Pizookie and a new Dubai Chocolate Pizookie.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Falling Alcohol Demand Is Still a Risk for BJ’s</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like other restaurants, BJ’s has raised its prices in 2025. In the third quarter, its prices were up 2% in comparison to last year. But that didn’t translate into growth in average check size, and one reason for that was because consumers ordered fewer alcoholic beverages. In my previous article, I mentioned that many younger consumers were avoiding alcohol and ordering treats like cookies instead, and that hasn't changed. BJ’s has an on-trend alternative with its Pizookies, but falling demand for alcohol is still a risk factor for the restaurant.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The AI Scheduling Software Has Not Been Fully Rolled Out Yet</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my last article about BJ’s Restaurants, I explained that the company was using AI scheduling software to reduce its labor costs. It’s using AI to forecast traffic and then using these forecasts to create schedules for its employees. In addition to reducing costs, the AI software could also deliver incremental revenue growth because the restaurant will be able to schedule more employees during peak hours.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While this software has already helped BJ’s become more efficient, the company hasn’t fully rolled out this AI scheduling software yet. <span>M</span>anagement explained that 30% of BJ’s locations would be using the software by the end of 2025. So this software isn’t just driving current margin expansion, it’s also likely to produce additional margin growth in 2026 as it gets installed at more restaurants.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Updated Valuation For BJ’s</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I used a different valuation method for BJ’s in my previous article than I’ve been using in my more recent articles. So, in this article, I’ll also recalculate what I expect its share price to be in 2026. Earlier in this article, I estimated that BJ’s would report $1.398 billion in revenue for the full year of 2025. It guided for $136 million in adjusted EBITDA, which is a 9.7% adjusted EBITDA margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It sounds like the third quarter’s results were weaker than usual because of last year’s Pizookie Meal Deal launch, and preliminary fourth-quarter results are better. So I’ll project that BJ’s reports 2% same-store sales growth and 3% overall revenue growth in 2026. BJ’s has around 200 restaurants right now. On the call, management said that BJ’s might add <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"two\" htloopnumber=\"523114578\">two</em> new locations in the second half of 2026, so I’d also add 0.5% revenue growth because of that factor. With 3.5% revenue growth in 2026, BJ’s revenue would rise to $1.447 billion. And with a 9.7% EBITDA margin, its EBITDA would be $140 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the market close on October 30, but before its post-market rally after earnings came out, BJ’s had a forward EV/EBITDA of 8.31. This was below the 10.39 median for the consumer discretionary sector. If BJ’s had a 2026 EV/EBITDA of 9 and an EBITDA of $140 million, its EV would be $1.26 billion. If you subtract $478 million in debt and add $26 million in cash, its market cap would be $808 million in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BJ’s has also reduced its diluted share count from 23.8 million to 23.4 million this year with share buybacks, and it’s planning to <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"523114578\">buy</em> back more shares. So I’d estimate that it will have 23.0 million shares in 2026. With a market cap of $808 million and 23.0 million shares, my new target price for BJ’s would be $35 per share in 2026. On October 30, its closing price was $29 per share, but its post-market price after its earnings report came out was $31 per share. So, my target price is 13% higher than the post-market price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BJ’s still has several growth drivers, such as its Pizookie Meal Deal and its limited-time, seasonal Pizookies. And it did face tougher comps this quarter. So, I think it will still report rising sales in 2026, but might not grow as fast as I originally expected, and that means its earnings won’t grow as fast as I expected either. Additionally, I also changed the valuation method I was using since I wrote my last article on BJ’s, but its stock price has fallen since then as well. At a price of $31, I still think it’s a <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"523114578\">buy</em>.</p>",
