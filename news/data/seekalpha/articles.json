My initial <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724107-the-battle-of-two-goliaths-ares-capital-vs-fs-kkr-update\">thesis</a> was based on strong fundamentals, unique loan origination capabilities and diversified investment platform, which positioned ARCC<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> well for capturing the increasing demand for private credit in a high-spread and low-risk manner.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the total return figure was very attractive and exceeded that of BDC index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BIZD\" title=\"VanEck BDC Income ETF\">BIZD</a>), I decided to liquidate my position before <a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/851/115851/original.pdf\">Q3 report</a>. In fact, I went even as far as plotting a case for a likely dividend reduction, hence the title of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4821765-dare-i-say-it-arcc-is-about-to-cut-its-dividend\">article</a>: <em>Dare I Say It, Ares Capital Is About To Cut Its Dividend</em>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main reason for this move was the combination of declining base rates, unfavorable exposure to spread compression dynamics, rising risks on the non-accrual front (due to large non first-lien position) and relatively thin base dividend coverage level.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plus, the fact that Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSDL\" title=\"Morgan Stanley Direct Lending Fund\">MSDL</a>) and Kayne Anderson BDC, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KBDC\" title=\"Kayne Anderson BDC, Inc.\">KBDC</a>) - comparable high-quality BDCs - were trading at almost 20% cheaper P/NAV metrics made my decision much easier. Just for the context, this is why I consider MSDL and KBDC directly comparable to ARCC:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>All three are externally managed BDCs (i.e., no reason for having premium for more cost effective internal management component).</li> <li>All three have investment grade balance sheets.</li> <li>None of them focuses on venture capital or lower middle market lending.</li> <li>The net debt to equity ratios are rather similar within 1.0x to 1.25x range (usual BDC target capital structure levels); and, actually, KBDC has 0.90x, which provides an advantage in terms of funding growth via additional debt issuances.</li> <li>Non-accruals on a FV basis are below 2.0% for all three names.</li> <li>The portfolio company interest rate coverage ratios are at 2.0x or above (MSDL and KBDC portfolio companies have even higher than it is for ARCC - at 2.0x).</li> <li>The base dividend coverage levels are almost identical - for ARCC it is 102% and for both MSDL and KBDC at 100%.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, the rationale for exiting ARCC is similar to what I have outlined in my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4827574-dare-i-say-it-bxsl-is-the-most-overpriced-quality-bdc-rating-downgrade\">piece</a> on Blackstone Secured Lending (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BXSL\" title=\"Blackstone Secured Lending Fund.\">BXSL</a>) - i.e., too high price relative to underlying fundamentals and comparable peer valuations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far, my thesis has been playing out nicely actually:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"750\" data-height=\"539\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Total returns\" width=\"640\" height=\"460\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"460\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/49926601-1761760624743119_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ycharts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, as I have stated in the title of this article, the Q3, 2025 report for ARCC was exceptionally strong, beating the consensus expectations and, to be honest, surprising me as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, let's now together dissect the key data points and determine whether ARCC has really become more attractive after the publication of Q3 financials.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All in all, ARCC bulls could not have asked for better results than what were delivered now. It seems that ARCC was firing on all cylinders in Q3 period, checking the necessary boxes for incremental value creation and stability across the board.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will share the main points that we should appreciate:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The NAV per share increased from $19.90 in Q2 to $20.01 now with the main driver being the second highest net realized gain amount that has been achieved since ARCC's inception.</li> <li>The weighted average spread over SOFR for the newly funded loan investments came in at 580 basis points, which implies a spread widening by about 20 basis points compared to the previous quarter.</li> <li>Non-accruals decreased from very low base of 1.2% in Q2 to 1.0% now.</li> <li>The underlying portfolio company credit profile improved as the TTM EBITDA continued to trend upwards.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of that, the management in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834260-ares-capital-arcc-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a> made it very clear to the audience that it is strongly committed to maintaining the existing dividend distribution amounts unchanged:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>As a starting point, in the third quarter of 2025, our core earnings continued to exceed our dividend. Second, during the last period of rising short-term interest rates in 2022 to '23, we intentionally set our dividend at a level equivalent to a 9% to 10% ROE, which is a level we have historically achieved through different interest rate cycles over the last 20 years. We set the dividend at this level because we believe we can sustain this level of profitability through market cycles. The third point worth highlighting on this topic is what we view as our unique financial position with multiple levers to expand earnings or offset headwinds solely from falling market rates.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plus, I know that many BDC investors like to pay attention to the undistributed spillover income, which in this case stands at $1.26 per share, representing more than 2 quarters of ARCC full dividend payments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hearing all of this, you might wonder how in the world one could be bearish on ARCC when basically all of the key fundamentals remain robust and/or are improving.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will explain. There are some important details that are not so obvious. But before doing that, I would like to once again emphasize that I am not recommending shorting ARCC. Instead, my overall motivation to avoid ARCC is primarily linked to the availability of more compelling BDC risk-adjusted return alternatives in the market, such as the aforementioned KBDC and MSDL.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, I have two conceptual items here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, the net investment income per share continued to decline, landing at $0.48 per share as of Q3, 2025. For me this was not a surprise because it is just inevitable that BDC portfolio yields will be going down in a lower base rate environment. So far, we have had only one 25 bps cut (and a second one right while I am writing this article), which has, by the way, only partially percolated through ARCC's books (it takes time). The portfolio-wide yield for ARCC has declined from 10.9% in Q2 to 10.6% now in Q3. Given that the <a href=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">consensus estimate</a> on the near-term base rate cuts indicate a total of 75 bps reduction (at least), there is still a long way to go for ARCC to reach equilibrium portfolio yield. And here we have to understand that it is per definition that ARCC's NII per share generation will get negatively impacted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just to introduce more details here:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>As per the most recent <a href=\"https://ir.arescapitalcorp.com/sec-filings\" rel=\"nofollow\">10-Q filing</a>, we can see that each 25 bps of a cut would translate to about $28 million of a drop in the net income or roughly 2% of the total ARCC's income result.</li> <li>If we factor in the already made cuts this year and additional 50 bps over the course of Q4, 2025 - Q1, 2026, the combined negative impact on the income generation would be between 6% and 8% as we have to remember that the first base rate cut that occurred earlier this year has not fully percolated through the system (e.g., private credit loans usually come with 3-month SOFR reset periods).</li> <li>On top of this, we have to add a headwind from the inflated non-accrual side, which as I will discuss below is currently below the <a href=\"https://ir-api.eqs.com/media/document/ebe3744a-6542-4474-a326-25ea40cf93b6/assets/ARCC_Q2-25_Investor_Presentation_vF.pdf?disposition=inline\" rel=\"nofollow\">historical average</a>. I think that assuming a convergence to the mean (i.e., an uptick of ~1.2% in non-accrual on a FV basis). It really depends on the specific case that goes to non-accrual, but a good rule of the thumb would be a synchronized NII per share drop.</li> <li>Finally, I have to mention the $2.15 billion of fixed rate notes that are currently outstanding with maturity dates kicking in on January, 2026 ($1.15 billion) and July, 2026 ($1 billion). Given the cost of debt that ARCC can achieve in the markets (<a href=\"https://www.raymondjames.com/-/media/rj/dotcom/files/corporations-and-institutions/investment-banking/industry-insight/bdc_update.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">low 5%</a>), there is about 2.5% (on a weighted average basis) of a drag from potential refinancings. On an annualized basis this implies ~$50 million of an interest expense headwind - i.e., ~1.75% of a drop in net income.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, by summing all of the variables together, we arrive at 8% to 10% of a near-term income reduction (by near-term I mean next 12 month period).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, considering that the quarterly base dividend is at $0.48 per share, it means that currently base dividend coverage is 100%. Namely, there is no margin of safety left for ARCC to cover the dividend with NII.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, while I fully appreciate ARCC's ability to underwrite investment at higher than average spreads that have lower than average risk, I just think that it would be only prudent that we factor in some kind of normalization (i.e., a scenario in which not everything works out perfectly as in this quarter).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, speaking of non-accruals, the current level of 1.0% (on FV basis) is below ARCC's historical average of around 2.2%. Sooner or later, there will be an upswing here, especially if we take into account the prevailing macro backdrop, which seems increasingly more uncertain/risky.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is also hard to imagine how ARCC could keep recognizing almost record beating net realized gains. The only reason why in Q3 ARCC was able to hit the significant figure was the sale of Potomac Energy Center, which was previously underperforming investment, placed on a non-accrual. Potomac resulted resulted in $262 million of net realized gain. For the context, over the past four quarters (excluding Q3, 2025), the average net realized gain position was actually negative $7.25 million. Plus, it happens very rarely that an underperforming asset gets restructured and monetized at gain (not loss) - i.e., we can consider it a one-off.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, I have to say that the earnings quality is not trending in the right direction. As of Q3, 2025, PIK consumed ~7.5% of the total income, marking an increase of around 12% on a year-over-year basis (similar dynamic if we compare to the previous quarter). From this we can extract two takeaways:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>On a cash-basis, the current dividend is undercovered.</li> <li>It seems that the spread widening for new deals was to a some extent enabled by a change in underwriting standards (as evidenced by higher share of PIK income component in Q3 than in the previous quarter, and management's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834260-ares-capital-arcc-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">commentary</a> on going into the LMM segment to search for higher spreads), which is, obviously, the right thing to do in order to combat the forthcoming pressures form lower base rates, but a risky game to play in the long-term.</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bottom line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ARCC is certainly a high-quality BDC and the Q3 data clearly support it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, in investing it is not only about value, but also about price you pay for it. While there is certainly a valid case for assuming premium pricing for ARCC, I still just don't see a justified ground for a) ~18% premium to <a href=\"https://www.raymondjames.com/-/media/rj/dotcom/files/corporations-and-institutions/investment-banking/industry-insight/bdc_update.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">sector median</a> and b) similar gap from the likes of KBDC and MSDL.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When it comes to ARCC's total return performance for the next 12-month period, my assumption would be that there will be a NAV decline, which should motivate the market to either reprice the stock or at least price ARCC in a more negative fashion than, say, KBDC and MSDL (i.e., comparable BDCs with significant discounts). At the same time, I do not think that the the NAV drop would be as deep as we could imply from my aforementioned 8% to 10% income decline (even though there is no surplus after dividend distributions). We have to remember that ARCC has the ability to issue new equity at NAV and that it has a spare financial capacity to accommodate organic portfolio growth, which is inherently accretive provided that there are no non-accruals offsetting that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Speaking of the dividend, in my humble opinion, ARCC's NII per share will continue to go down due to systematic headwinds - mostly lower base rates and continued spread compression. Again, I do not think that in the next 12-month period we will see 8% to 10% of a decline in the NII per share (as the pure math would suggest) and thus deeply under covered dividend because of the same exact reasons that I provided on the NAV component. Namely, ARCC has the ability to expand portfolio in an accretive manner and, on top of that, it has a notable undistributed spillover, which could be used for a long time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, the only scenario under which I could see ARCC cutting its dividend in the next 12-month period is if the pace and magnitude of base rate cuts accelerate (think of new Fed chair being a clear monetary dove) and there are new material non-accruals emerging (think of ARCC's PIK share and general weakness in the economy), which send the stock price below NAV and make the shortfall in the dividend coverage even deeper.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, I think that ARCC is a hold. It is not a sell due to relatively balanced P/NAV (1.02x) and the potential that lies in the spare financial capacity that could come in handy for offsetting the pressures from lower base rates and new non-accruals, where the latter aspect has been historically well-managed by ARCC.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, I do not think that ARCC is a buy either. Putting all of the aforementioned pieces together, I simply do not see how ARCC could deliver positive growth that would justify experiencing material NAV growth and thus share price increase. The decision to not invest in ARCC is for sure made easier by the fact that relatively comparable BDCs such as MSDL and KBDC trade at rather steep discount to ARCC (18% in KBDC's case and 19% in MSDL's case) - i.e., in a nutshell, ARCC's strengths are not sufficient to fully justify such a gap in the valuations.</p>",

We sold the position and reallocated to what we view as higher-quality EQV stocks, including <strong>Heidelberg</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HLBZF\" title=\"Heidelberg Materials AG\">OTCPK:HLBZF</a>) and <strong>Saint-Gobain</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CODGF\" title=\"Compagnie de Saint-Gobain S.A.\">OTCPK:CODGF</a>) that we believe are better positioned in favorable construction themes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>CGI</strong>, a Canadian IT services firm, has been in our view a solid long-term performer. However, weakening demand, AI-related disruption risks and pricing pressure raised concerns about its competitive advantage, prompting us to sell the stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Wolters Kluwer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WOLTF\" title=\"Wolters Kluwer N.V.\">OTCPK:WOLTF</a>)</strong>, a Dutch information services company, faced deteriorating earnings and slowing organic growth.

Underweights in utilities and real estate also added to relative results. Geographically, exposure in the US (categorized by country of risk) and stock selection in Hong Kong and Australia contributed to relative return.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stock selection in financials detracted the most from relative return, with notable weakness in financial exchanges. Holdings in consumer discretionary, materials and IT also underperformed their respective benchmark sectors, detracting from relative results. An underweight in materials hampered relative return as well. Geographically, stock selection in Japan, the UK and China were key detractors from relative results, as was an underweight in China.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Contributors to performance</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below are some of the largest contributors to absolute return for the quarter:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Taiwan Semiconductor</strong> beat second quarter earnings expectations and raised guidance. Strong AI chip demand, pricing power in advanced nodes and favorable foreign exchange trends boosted profit margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Legrand,</strong> a global specialist in electrical and digital building infrastructures, outperformed as revenue and margins beat expectations, supported by its data center “white space” business, which designs, builds and optimizes physical floor space of data centers. A recovery in real estate markets could further boost upside potential. <strong>Trip.com,</strong> China’s leading online travel agency, benefited from domestic travel growth and expanding international operations. Margins exceeded forecasts due to lower marketing spending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Detractors from performance</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below are the largest detractors from absolute return for the quarter:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Shimano</strong> is a global leader in bike components. Profit margins fell short of expectations due to product rollout costs and overseas labor pressures. High bike inventories, especially in China, have remained a short-term drag, but we expect this to normalize over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>RELX</strong> is a London-based provider of data analytics and decision tools (including Elsevier and LexisNexis). Potential disruption from AI, particularly in its Legal and Scientific, Technical and Medical (STM) segments, weighed on the stock’s valuation. Despite the company actively integrating AI into its offerings, apparent market skepticism and a high valuation prompted us to trim the position.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>London Stock Exchange,</strong> a leading global market infrastructure and data provider, saw a decline in its stock price, driven by AI concerns about its Workspace and Refinitiv Eikon platforms, as well as rising competition. We believe the market currently undervalues its data/analytics business and its AI partnership with Microsoft (not a fund holding).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1724\" data-height=\"503\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Standardized performance (%) as of September 30, 2025\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"187\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55028208-17618286383142455_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p>Expense ratios per the current prospectus: Class A: Net: 1.27%, Total: 1.27%; Class R6: Net: 0.86%, Total: 0.86%; Class Y: Net: 1.02%, Total: 1.02%.</p> <p>Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher.

A higher Sharpe ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance. <strong>Information Ratio</strong> is a measurement of portfolio returns beyond the returns of a benchmark, usually an index, compared to the volatility of those returns. <strong>Standard deviation</strong> measures a fund's range of total returns and identifies the spread of a fund's short-term fluctuations. <strong>Tracking Error</strong> is defined as the expected standard deviation of a portfolio's excess return over the benchmark index return. The <strong>up and down capture</strong> measures how well a manager was able to replicate or improve on periods of positive benchmark returns and how severely the manager was affected by periods of negative benchmark returns. <strong>Maximum Drawdown</strong> is the maximum observed loss from a high to a low of a portfolio, before a new high is attained. Maximum drawdown is an indicator of downside risk over a specified time period. <strong>Weighted Average Market Cap</strong> is a measure of the average size of company held in a portfolio. The percentage of the portfolio invested each company, or its weight, is multiplied by its size (market capitalization). An average of the weighted size of all companies held is then calculated. <strong>Price/earnings</strong> measures the price per share relative to the earnings per share of the company while excluding extraordinary items. <strong>Price to book</strong> measures the firm's capitalization (market price) to book value. <strong>Est. 3-5 year EPS (Earning per share) growth</strong> measures the earning per share growth from FY3 to FY5. <strong>ROE</strong> is the Return on Equity that measures the fund's annual return relative to total shareholders' equity. This ratio evaluates how quickly investments can be turned into profits. <strong>Long-term debt to capital</strong> measures a fund’s financial leverage by calculating the proportion of long-term debt used to finance its assets relative to the amount of equity used for the same purpose. A higher ratio indicates higher leverage. <strong>Operating margin</strong> measures the profit a fund makes for every dollar of sales after paying the variable expenses. <strong>Contribution to Return</strong> measures the performance impact from portfolio holdings over a defined time period. It takes into account both weight and performance of the portfolio holdings. Contribution to Return is calculated at security level.</p> <p><strong>Morningstar</strong></p> <p>Source: ©2025 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved.

The company produces its own yarns, assemblage garments and distributes its own products.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Such vertical integration provides not just more opportunities to retain margins throughout the chain, but also helps with control and visibility, as the control also makes it easier for the business to implement key labor and environmental practices through its supply chain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company generates some 90% of sales from activewear products and the remainder from inner wear, with some 75% of sales tied to printer and just a 25% retail exposure. The company employs some 50,000 workers, is heavily focused on operations at ¨home¨ (that being Central America and the Caribbean), with almost all sales generated from in-house manufacturing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company generates some $3.3 billion in sales as a standalone business, these being very profitable operations, with EBITDA margins reported around 25% of sales. The company has seen modest operational advancements over the past decade, in which revenues rose some 30% to $3.3 billion, a period in which operating margins rose from the mid-teens to the low-twenties. By far the biggest achievement is that of capital allocation, with nearly 40% of the shares being bought back over this period of time.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation Thoughts &amp; Massive Deal</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In July, the company <a href=\"https://gildancorp.com/media/uploads/news/2025-07/bgildan_publishes_q2_2025_earnings_results.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> its second quarter results, calling for 2025 sales growth up in the mid-single digits, seeing sales just over $3.4 billion this year. Operating margins are seen moving up towards 22% of sales, suggesting that a $750 million operating profit number might be in the works.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A $50 stock was granted a $7.5 billion equity valuation based on a share count of 149 million and some shares. Net debt of $1.8 billion resulted in a leverage ratio around 2.2 times, with the pro forma enterprise valuation pegged at $9.3 billion. That values the business at 2.7 times sales, around 11 times EBITDA and with adjusted earnings seen around $3.50 per share, equity was valued at a modest 14 times multiple on that front.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this was about to change, as the company <a href=\"https://gildancorp.com/media/uploads/news/2025-08/bgildan-hanesbrands_pr_20250812_final.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> its intention to acquire troubled peer <span></span>Hanesbrands in August, in order to create a leading global basic apparel leader. That deal valued <span></span>Hanesbrands at $4.4 billion, split 50/50 between the valuation attached to the equity and net debt assumed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The deal is designed to add the inner wear business of <span></span>Hanesbrands, in order to create a much more balanced business with much larger scale, one with revenues seen more than doubling to $6.9 billion as <span></span>Hanesbrands is even slightly larger in terms of sales. These scale benefits are key, with costs synergies seen reaching $200 million in year three post closing, that is equal to nearly 3% of pro forma sales!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Both businesses are pretty much different, with <span></span>Hanesbrands focusing on inner wear, having more supply chains in Asia, which is a risk given the tariffs and being much stronger in retail instead of wholesale as well. The combination is set to employ over 90,000 workers with revenues split pretty evenly between active and inner wear as well as retail and wholesale outlets, having a more global exposure and certainly a more global supply chain.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial Impact</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Deal terms call for largely an exchange of stock, with investors in <span></span>Hanesbrands being given 0.102 shares of Gildan and $0.80 per share fore very share they own, valuing equity around $6.00 per share based on the unaffected share price.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on a share count of some 357 million shares, that implies little over 36 million shares of Gildan issued, with investors in HanesBrands´s given a 19.9% equity stake in the pro forma business with a share count of 185 million shares.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The cash component runs at less than $300 million, which in between existing net debt of $1.85 billion of Gildan and about $2.2 billion from <span></span>Hanesbrands, makes for a roughly $4.4 billion net debt load. Pro forma EBITDA is seen at $1.35 billion, for a 3.2 times leverage ratio, as this leverage ratio falls to 2.8 times if we factor in the two hundred million in synergies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company sees leverage come down to 2.6 times, but this lower ratio is likely the result of timing of the deal closing, and the potential to deleverage until that point in time, as well as proceeds from the anticipated investment of the <span></span>Hanesbrands activities in Australia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If all this works, the company sees a 20% compounded annual growth rate in the period 2026 until 2028, that is from a $3.50 per share number seen this year, which at the lower end of the range suggests earnings per share of around $6 per share by 2028.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors Like It</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors in Gildan, and thus <span></span>Hanesbrands, acted relieved on the back of the deal announcement as shares rose some 10% to the $55 mark in August upon the announcement, having risen further to $60 in the weeks thereafter. This move is for good reasons, that of greater market position, more diversified operations abut moreover targeted synergies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By the end of October, Gildan <a href=\"https://gildancorp.com/media/uploads/news/2025-10/bgildan_publishes_q3_2025_earnings_results.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a> third quarter results, as the results triggered some minor both upward and downward revisions in the full year guidance here, with operating margins seen slightly higher than previously anticipated, while free cash flows are seen pressured a bit. Amidst the halt of buybacks until the acquisition, net debt was actually down over a hundred million (sequentially) to $1.74 billion. Further importance was the commentary on the <span></span>Hanesbrands deal, already seen taking place later this year, or early in 2026, both being rather quick.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, expectations have risen a bit as well, given a quick 20% return in the time frame of just a few months since the deal for <span></span>Hanesbrands has been announced. This is driven by anticipated earnings per share growth, but at the same time comes with leverage being on the increase, execution risks being apparent and synergies to be realized upon, with those cost savings being substantial by all means.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On paper there is much to like, driven by the significant synergies and earnings per share growth assumptions, however I have some reserves as well. This includes the fact that this is a Canadian-US acquisition, which is a bit more culturally sensitive these days. Moreover, with <span></span>Hanesbrands losing its US status to some extent, more political risks related to tariffs might be on the increase again, after the situation has been highly uncertain already here.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In between all this, I am keen to watch the situation from here, but anticipating some hiccups down the road, I look forward to keeping a close eye on the business and are considering on potential and frankly anticipate hiccups here down the road.</p>",

Unfortunately, 7 team members were killed in the tragedy where ~800,000 metric tons of wet material entered the Grasberg Block Cave underground mine from the former Grasberg open pit and traveled rapidly to multiple levels of the mine.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Freeport-McMoRan reported Q3 results generally close to expectations, but the company expects major impacts to mining activities into 2026. The company is currently investigating the incident and working to remove the mud from the facilities through year end.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The copper miner <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4498336-freeport-mcmoran-plunges-after-lowering-forecast-for-q3-copper-gold-sales\">submitted a plan</a> back on September 24 to restart some unaffected areas during Q4, followed by a phased restart and ramp-up of the Grasberg Block Cave mine during 2026. Management is forecasting a reduction in 2026 production by ~35% of pre-incident estimates at 1.7 billion pounds of copper and 1.6 million ounces of gold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Freeport-McMoRan plans to hold a conference call with analysts and investors on November 18 to update the market on the multi-year financial outlook in lieu of holding a Q3<span></span> '25 earnings call. The company would appear to suggest a full return to normal operations by 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key to the copper market is that the loss of 1.7 billion pounds of production will only contribute to much higher prices than otherwise. Copper currently trades near the all-time highs at $5.14/lb.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"842\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"421\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/234751-17617671146778367_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Kitco</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Morgan Stanley has recently predicted the <a href=\"https://www.mining.com/copper-price-hits-record-in-london-on-supply-worries/#:~:text=Stock%20image.,of%20the%20US%2C%20he%20added.\" rel=\"nofollow\">most severe copper shortage</a> in more than 20 years.

Analysts are predicting the following annual numbers:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>EPS - $2.79</li> <li>Revenue - $31.5 billion</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Freeport-McMoRan lists a $3.0 billion cash balance with a debt level of $9.3 billion. The copper miner has a net debt level of $6.3 billion, placing the company in a strong position with the expectation for an insurance recovery of up to $1 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company faces a tough road ahead fully restarting GBC mining operations, but the business shouldn't see a major hit due to the higher copper prices from the lower output leading to a major copper shortage. Copper mines are difficult to develop, leaving a limited supply that can reach the market and replace the lost production.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest risk is naturally a much longer period of ramping up production at Grasberg and even potentially some level of higher capex to get the GBC back operational with upwards of 300 million pounds of copper at risk. The company has a solid financial picture, and naturally any scenario where copper prices actually plunge in the next year would harm the business when most vulnerable.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Takeaway</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The key investor takeaway is that Freeport-McMoRan has already rebounded from a mid-September update that caused a major selloff. Investors should use any future weakness in the stock to load up on the copper miner with signs 2027 capacity will return to normal and the copper market will face severe shortages. The company shouldn't face any long-term impacts from a mining incident, and investors should use market dislocations to add the copper miner.</p>",

In addition, the annualized returns in its different time frames show a minimal difference versus market price, indicating that the creation/redemption mechanism (APs + market makers) minimizes premiums/discounts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, there are no surprises in the tracking difference of NAV returns versus index returns. The ranges are consistent with an expense ratio of 0.35% +/- the effect of income from the securities lending part, sampling and rebalancing costs of an “equal weighted” index (which involves a higher turnover vs a cap-weight and therefore higher costs).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As noted earlier, NAV and market price have been in near-perfect alignment: they coincide in the 1 and 10 year tranches, while they barely differ in 1-2 bp in 3 and 5 years. Therefore, the price of the market share correctly reflects the value of the underlying basket and suggests that average discounts/premiums are low with good market depth.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"886\" data-height=\"402\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"XOP Yields\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"290\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-1761742731096336_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, XOP has a modest 30D <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOP/dividends/scorecard\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOP/dividends/scorecard\" target=\"_blank\">yield of 2.49%</a> that adds to the position of investors and reinforces the thesis of the fund proposal based on the exposure to the beta of the E&amp;P segment and not maximize coupons/dividends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Friendly reminder: this is a cyclical sector</strong></p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1320\" data-height=\"509\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"XOP Performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"247\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427311230512_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>XOP SPDR® S&amp;P® Oil &amp;

It is built with three pieces in z-score:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>z_WTI : The price of standardized WTI crude oil in z-score over a moving window (weekly).</p></li> <li><p>z_HH: Henry Hub gas price standardized in z-score (weekly).</p></li> <li><p>z_Inv_inv: U.S. commercial crude oil inventories inverted and standardized; measures tightness. It is inverted because less inventory implies a tighter market and is a positive reading, thus aligning the logic of the movement with the other series.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The formula for obtaining the Physical Tightness Composite applies a weight of 60% to prices (giving more importance to crude than to gas in a ratio of 70-30) and 40% to the physical stress (low inventories). This gives the formula: Physical Tightness Composite = 0.6*(0.7*z_WTI + 0.3*z_HH) + 0.4*z_Inv_inv.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To interpret it, when the series is above 0 is a positive indicator that can be given by prices above their recent averages and/or contained inventories. Meanwhile, when it is below zero the context is unfavorable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a rule, since a z-score measures how many standard deviations a variable is from its recent average, stretches above +0.5 are not considered “one-week noise” and anticipate tailwinds. I would apply the opposite in -0.5.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"467\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financial Conditions Composite\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"187\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427821668348_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Node Analytica</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><strong>Financial Conditions Composite</strong></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the other part of the macro analysis, we will use the Financial Conditions Composite. This signal brings together in a single weekly index three legs that influence the valuation and financing of E&amp;P:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p>z_HY_inv: spread high yield (HY OAS) in inverted z-score. Because the lower the credit, the better, it is reversed to match the logic.</p></li> <li><p>z_Real_inv: real rate 10Y (DFII10) in inverted z-score; reversed by the same case: low real rates → best discount.</p></li> <li><p>z_USD_inv: Broad U.S. Dollar Index (DTWEXBGS) in inverted z-score. It is also reversed because a weak (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOW\" title=\"Lowe's Companies, Inc.\">LOW</a>) USD is positive for refinancing other economies and is beneficial for commodities (DTWEXBGS is used against DXY because it better represents the “global” USD that affects oil demand and price formation).</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this case, the signal is composed of a weighted average in which greater weight is given to the credit leg (z_HY_inv): 50%, followed by z_Real_inv with 30% and finally, 20% for z_USD_inv. Thus, the formula we use is: Financial Conditions Composite = 0.5*z_HY_inv + 0.3*z_Real_inv + 0.2 * z_USD_inv.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To analyze it, values above 0 suggest a favorable financial environment that can be given by contained spreads, lower real rates and/or a less strong USD. Below zero, we would be in an unfavorable environment. Likewise, the logic would be applied that when the composite is in a stretch above +0.5 , we would speak of tailwinds for the E&amp;P and vice versa when the value is &lt; -0.5. Close to its historical average (zero), we would treat it as a neutral regime, in which case it is better to wait for movements to either side to draw conclusions.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"467\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Physical Tightness Composite Zoom\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"187\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60407943-17617427822609496_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Node Analytica</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><strong>Physical Tightness Composite Zoom</strong></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Analyzing both composites, after two attacks of Physical Tightness to break the rise first in January and June this year, failed to consolidate momentum and since then the trend has been downward, recently standing at -0.60. This is a sign of an unfavorable environment, in which the clearly determining factor is a below-normal price of oil. A rebound in the price of crude oil, news of a decline in production, or a further narrowing of inventories, would help reverse the trend. However, financial conditions are shown to be in a positive zone of +0.69. So for the time being, neither real rates nor the strength of the dollar are holding back the sector's prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the physical backdrop against us and financial conditions supportive, the situation is prudent as a worsening of financial conditions would add to the negative effect of the physicist. Meanwhile, the baseline scenario for 3-6 months suggests that we will see a range with lateral-bearish bias for XOP, limited by the lack of physical support. Based on this, the suggested operation is to maintain the position and avoid adding / scaling in until we see an improvement of the Physical Tightness is seen. In the event that financial conditions change course and do not change the pattern of Physical Tightness, consider reducing positions.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally, our XOP ETF offers pure beta to the E&amp;P with equal weighting but at the same time brings greater volatility against cap-weighted alternatives.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Likewise, until a clear catalyst to boost oil and gas prices emerges, even with financial conditions in a favorable environment, the recommended stance is Hold.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thank you for your reading.</p>",

Results were impacted by weaker-than-expected demand from industrial end markets, and we believe some of the share price weakness also reflected profit-taking following strong performance in prior periods. From our perspective, these short-term dynamics do not alter the structural advantages of MonotaRO’s business model. The company continues to gain traction with large enterprise customers, who now represent over 30% of sales. These clients typically have higher lifetime value and are more likely to adopt MonotaRO’s value-added services, such as purchase management systems, which enhance customer retention and deepen relationships. Importantly, we believe MonotaRO’s value proposition lies in convenience, execution and product curation—qualities that are difficult to replicate in Japan’s fragmented MRO market. With a high-margin, asset-light model, a scalable platform and a long runway to expand share across businesses of all sizes, we continue to view MonotaRO as a high-quality, competitively advantaged business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Accenture, the global IT consultancy, was one of the largest detractors. </strong>The company’s operations are split roughly evenly between Consulting and Managed Services (outsourcing). While Accenture’s strategic pivot to AI in 2023 has driven a rapid increase in AI-related revenue and bookings (nearly doubling to $5.9 billion in fiscal 2025), investors have grown increasingly concerned about the longer-term impact of AI on its outsourcing business—revenue heavily reliant on billable hours. Moreover, the U.S. government’s DOGE initiative created a headwind, as federal contracts have historically represented about 8% of Accenture’s revenue. Despite these challenges, Accenture continues to grow, albeit at a below-normal rate in the recent period, while simultaneously investing in its workforce—now employing roughly 77,000 AI and data specialists, about 10% of its global staff—and returning billions of dollars to shareholders through double-digit increases in both dividends (+10% year-over-year) and share buybacks (+15%). While we acknowledge that market concerns about AI’s disruptive potential warrant consideration, we believe Accenture shares have been excessively punished (valuations are at 10-year lows). The stock has retreated to mid-2020 levels, even though earnings per share and FREE cash flow are more than 50% and 40% higher, respectively, than they were at that time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Credicorp, the largest bank in Peru, was a leading contributor during the quarter.</strong> Results exceeded expectations, supported by robust loan growth—particularly in microfinance and retail segments—stable asset quality and disciplined cost management, even as Peru’s central bank cut rates. From our perspective, these outcomes represent the strength of a well-executed long-term strategy. Credicorp’s multi-pronged platform—anchored in banking, insurance and wealth management—offers durable advantages in an underpenetrated financial system. Its leading positions in microfinance (via Mibanco), pension fund management and investment advisory foster lasting customer relationships and recurring revenue through multi-product engagement. The company is also prudently expanding its digital ecosystem, enhancing efficiency and broadening access across income levels. Importantly, even amid macroeconomic uncertainty, management has consistently prioritized long-term value over volume, allocating capital conservatively and maintaining disciplined underwriting. We believe this enduring combination of diversification, market leadership and risk-aware culture supports our conviction in Credicorp as a resilient business with the ability to compound value over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Erste Group Bank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EBKOF#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\" title=\"Erste Group Bank AG\">OTCPK:EBKOF</a>), a leading retail and commercial bank in Central and Eastern Europe, was a primary contributor during the quarter. </strong>Shares rose following strong results, supported by healthy loan growth, stable deposits and solid fee income. Looking beyond near-term performance, Erste announced its intent to acquire a significant stake in Santander Bank Polska (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BKZHF#hasComeFromMpArticle=false#source=section%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link\" title=\"Santander Bank Polska S.A.\">OTCPK:BKZHF</a>), one of Poland’s largest banks. This transaction would expand Erste’s geographic footprint into a structurally attractive market, adding scale and diversification while providing exposure to one of the fastest-growing economies in the region. As a retail-oriented bank with meaningful exposure to underbanked populations across Central and Eastern Europe, we believe Erste is well positioned to benefit as Central and Eastern economies grow, cross key income thresholds, and drive increasing demand for financial services. In addition, we believe ongoing cost efficiencies—particularly through increased use of technology—should further improve profitability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"> </p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td> <p>(All MSCI index returns are shown net and in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.)</p> <p>Disclosures</p> <p>The opinions expressed herein are those of Aristotle Capital Management, LLC (Aristotle Capital) and are subject to change without notice.

Pure gross returns do not reflect the deduction of any trading costs or other fees and are supplemental to the net returns. Net returns are calculated by subtracting the highest applicable wrap/SMA fee, which includes trading costs and custodial fees, from the pure gross composite return. (From inception to 12/31/2015, the highest applicable wrap/SMA fee is 3.00% on an annual basis, or 0.75% quarterly. From 1/1/2016 to 12/31/2023, the highest applicable wrap/SMA fee is 2.00% on an annual basis, or 0.50% quarterly and 0.17% monthly from 1/1/2024 to present.)</p> <p>All investments carry a certain degree of risk, including the possible loss of principal. Investments are also subject to political, market, currency and regulatory risks or economic developments. International investments involve special risks that may in particular cause a loss in principal, including currency fluctuation, lower liquidity, different accounting methods and economic and political systems, and higher transaction costs. These risks typically are greater in emerging markets. While Large-capitalization companies may have more stable prices than smaller, less established companies, they are still subject to equity securities risk. In addition, large-capitalization equity security prices may not rise as much as prices of equity securities of small-capitalization companies. Securities of small- and medium-sized companies tend to have a shorter history of operations and be more volatile and less liquid.

Earnings have gradually declined, which culminated in<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> a large loss in the most recent report, an uncommon occurrence at IMOS. The stock in turn has been put in shackles, being unable to move out of the hole it fell in. However, the worst may have passed and IMOS may be past the trough, which could be why the stock is looking to break free from its shackles.

On the other hand, the article also mentioned there were a number of reasons for long IMOS, if one is in it for the long run, especially with IMOS possessing a number of attributes most investors are likely to appreciate in a stock. As a result, I opted to rate IMOS a buy in the article.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1523\" data-height=\"904\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"IMOS chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"380\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"380\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/5933791-17617524801386352_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Thinkorswim app</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The chart above shows how the stock fell at first, especially after the release of the most recent earnings report, but this proved to be a misdirection because IMOS has since proceeded to move higher to the point it is at the highs for 2025. Moreover, it appears the stock is in the process of breaking out by moving past resistance that has kept the stock down for over a year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The chart of the past 12 months shows the number of times the stock was unable to get past the $20-21 region once it fell below it about a year ago, beyond brief forays on an intraday basis. For instance, the stock topped out in this region in January, February, June and as recently as this October, to be followed each time by the stock pulling back to lower levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, this hold on IMOS seems to be giving way. The stock closed at $21.14 on October 20, which is worth noting because it is the first time the stock managed to close above $21.00 ever since it fell below this price level one year ago. The stock managed to do this for the second time on October 27 by closing even higher at $21.41.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IMOS followed this up by closing at $23.29 on October 28, making it the first back-to-back close above the $20-21 region in almost a year. Note that it may be too early to conclude IMOS has breached resistance since the stock still needs to provide confirmation, which would require one or two additional consecutive closes above the aforementioned region. Some may also want a retest of prior resistance to be fully convinced resistance has been broken.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is still possible for the stock to head back to the $20-21 region, but it does appear IMOS is breaking out, a bullish signal. It’s worth mentioning that IMOS went from a high of $32.19 in March 2024 to a low of $12.78 in April 2025, and if we retrace this move, the 50% Fibonacci retracement of $32.19 to $12.7 is $22.49, which probably played a role in IMOS jumping higher on October 28 after the stock managed to surpass this price point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we assume IMOS has broken out and is on the way higher, then it may be able to head as far as the next potential resistance level. This could be the next or 61.8% Fibonacci retracement, which would take the stock to around $24.78. The stock may pause as it gets closer to this price level, but the resistance that kept it locked up for a year would be no more.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings have gone down, but the worst could be over</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The decline in the stock starting in March 2024 coincided with a decline in earnings at IMOS. Earnings declined sequentially in each of the past four earnings reports to culminate in a quarterly loss, which is rare for IMOS and the first in years. In the <a href=\"https://www.chipmos.com/english/ir/info2.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">most recent</a> or Q2 FY2025 report, revenue declined by 1.3% YoY to NTD5,735.8M or $196.6M and IMOS recorded a net loss of NTD533.1M or $18.3M, which converts to a net loss of $0.51 per ADS, down from a profit of $0.42 a share a year ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gross margin decreased by 740 bps YoY to 6.6%, but it is worth pointing out that the net loss was mostly the result of a foreign exchange loss of NTD690M or $23.6M. Exchange rates are skewing the results and it may be better to look at EBITDA, which came in at NTD1,302.4M in Q2 FY2025, down from NTD1,424.7M in Q1 FY2025 and NTD1,558.3M in Q2 FY2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IMOS was still worse off, but not as badly at it appears at first based on the headline numbers. Furthermore, there is reason to think the streak of four consecutive declines in quarterly earnings will end with the upcoming report, which is scheduled to be released on November 11. Unlike other companies, IMOS releases monthly <a href=\"https://www.chipmos.com/english/ir/financial.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">revenue updates</a> and the latest update shows revenue grew by 10.6% YoY to NTD2,087.4M in September.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">IMOS looks relatively inexpensive at current valuations</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If we add up the numbers, then the Q3 FY2025 report is very likely to report a 1.2% YoY increase in revenue to NTD6,143.7M or $201.7M, which would make it the best quarter in terms of the top line in three years. Using this as a guideline, my estimate is that Q3 FY2025 earnings will come in at about $0.60 per ADS, although exchange rates may skew the final number. This would be a big improvement since IMOS earned $0.26, $0.19 and $0.15 in the three quarters from Q3 FY2024 to Q1 FY2025 and after it lost $0.51 per ADS in Q2 FY2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IMOS has earned just $0.09 TTM, which accords IMOS a P/E ratio of 258.8x with the stock last closing at $23.29 per ADS, but this number is skewed by forex losses. In terms of EBITDA, which in this case is more representative of how the company is doing from an operational standpoint, IMOS earned NTD5,754.7M TTM, which converts to $188.7M using a USD:NTD exchange rate of 1:30.5.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IMOS has a market cap of $812M, debt of $528.8M and cash worth $470.8M, which gives IMOS an enterprise value of $870M. EV/EBITDA is thus 4.6x, which looks much better than a P/E in the triple digits. IMOS would only need to grow EBITDA at a CAGR in the 5% range for a PEG of less than one, which according to the methodology of Peter Lynch would make IMOS undervalued relative to growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why the recovery could have legs to it</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, Q3 FY2025 is just one quarter and one good quarter does not make a trend. However, there is reason to feel optimistic that IMOS can build on the improvement in demand in Q3 FY2025, as shown by the monthly revenue figures. This is because IMOS is highly exposed to the <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/10/27/news-memory-makers-reportedly-halt-quotes-on-select-dram-nand-products-as-china-faces-daily-pricing/\" rel=\"nofollow\">memory market</a> and demand for DRAM and NAND has gotten stronger.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Prices for both have risen, a sign of growing demand. In contrast, DRAM and NAND in particular were both dealing with soft demand most of last year and into this year, except in certain segments like those exposed to datacenter demand. In response to these weak conditions in the memory market, the OEMs shifted memory production towards segments where demand was better, like, for instance, HBM to take advantage of capital pouring into AI.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This caused supply for other memory segments like mobile to drop, which seems to have had a positive effect on the overall market for memory products given that prices have risen so strongly compared to last year. If the memory market has fully recovered from the downturn, IMOS is likely not far behind and the loss of Q2 FY2025 was in all likelihood the bottom.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The dividend looks safe</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A major reason to be long IMOS over the year is that it has a long track record of paying a dividend, which is usually much higher than what most tech names pay out. The last dividend was $0.82 per ADS, which seems high given that IMOS only earned a fraction of this amount. This may have created doubts about the sustainability of the dividend.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, if IMOS earns the estimated $0.60 in the upcoming report, and the recovery continues for reasons mentioned earlier, than that should help ease concerns about the dividend. The dividend payout varies from year to year and can be adjusted if needed. There is also enough cash on the balance sheet to cover the dividend, even if the income statement would not be able to.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Are there risks facing IMOS?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Declining earnings was not the only headwind facing IMOS in the past one and a half year. Other issues that have weighed on IMOS during this period include natural disasters and the state of relations between Taiwan, where IMOS is based, and the U.S. and China. For instance, there have been a couple of episodes of earthquakes in both 2024 and 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tensions with mainland China spike from time to time, and while they have left a temporary impact in terms of how the stock trades during these episodes, they have not affected actual quarterly results to a significant degree. This is because each episode has ended the same way with an easing in tensions in the Taiwan Strait.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One issue that has also not been as bad as perhaps feared is the issue of tariffs. The Trump Administration alluded to semiconductor tariffs earlier in the year, but they have yet to implement them. On the contrary, semiconductors were among the items excluded when the U.S. imposed tariffs in April after “Liberation Day”. Tariffs have not been a problem for IMOS so far, but it is possible this could change in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investor takeaways</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IMOS was essentially locked up for almost an entire year. The stock fell below the $20-21 price region a year ago and in spite of repeated attempts, IMOS was unable to trade back above this region, brief forays notwithstanding. Each attempt to move past the resistance imposed resulted in the stock heading south. That is until the last several days.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The stock has moved well above the $20-21 region in the last couple of days after being stuck below it for almost an entire year. While it is not impossible for the stock to drop again, it appears IMOS has broken the resistance that kept it contained, which opens the door to higher stock prices, something that was not to be expected with the stock locked down by resistance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IMOS went through a downturn since early last year, but there are signs the downturn is ending, if it has not already ended. Monthly revenue figures suggest the upcoming report will be the best in years, a sharp turnaround from the quarterly loss reported in the last report. The memory market is on the upswing and this should give IMOS a boost in the coming quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the recent surge in the stock price means IMOS is no longer available at less than book value, IMOS is still available at a EV/EBITDA of less than 5x. IMOS should also be able to grow EBITDA at a CAGR of at least 5-10% in the next three years, assuming the downturn has ended and the upcoming report marks the official start of an upturn.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am bullish on IMOS with the above in mind. Whether it is the monthly revenue figures or the state of the memory market, there is reason to believe IMOS is transitioning from a downturn to an upturn. The stock price was in the doldrums during the downturn and if it gets back to where it was before the downturn took down the stock, the recent rally in the stock is just the beginning.</p>",

It also operates e-commerce platforms, including <a href=\"https://Driveway.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Driveway.com</a> and <a href=\"https://GreenCars.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">GreenCars.com</a>. A basic idea of what LAD really does is the sale of new and used vehicles, the arrangement of finance and insurance [F&amp;I] products, and aftersales support (includes automotive repair and maintenance). It also has a financing division called Driveway Finance Corporation [DFC].</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings Review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">LAD saw a decent <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20274777-lithia-and-driveway-lad-reports-record-third-quarter-revenue-of-9_7-billion-achieves-11#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A2\">Q3 2025 quarter</a>, with record quarterly revenue of $9.7 billion, up 4.9% y/y from $9.2 billion in Q3 2024. On a same-store basis, growth was even stronger at 7.7% y/y. In terms of segment, new vehicle retail revenue grew 5.5% y/y on a same-store basis, but new vehicle gross profit per unit [GPU] fell 10.8% y/y to $2,867. Used vehicles did better, with same-store revenue up 11.8% y/y, but GPU also saw 4.8% y/y decline to $1,767. F&amp;I also contributed positively, with 5.7% y/y same-store revenue growth. The same goes for aftersales revenue, which grew 3.9% y/y on a same-store basis. Together, gross profit grew 2.5% y/y to $1.47 billion, with overall gross margin only moderately easing by 30 bps y/y to 15.2% (mainly due to new vehicle margins). However, OPEX inched upwards with SG&amp;A expenses up 5.8% y/y, which led to flattish y/y adj. EBIT ($421.6 million in Q3 2025), while adj. net income grew 9.7% y/y to $239.4 million. The difference is primarily due to lower floor plan interest expense vs. last year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bullish aspects</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think the aftersales segment will remain as the main profit driver for the foreseeable future, and so far, it is evident that demand is strong. While same-store revenue grew 3.9% y/y, same-store gross profit grew even faster by 9.1% y/y. This pushed same-store gross margin to a record 58.4%, up 280 bps y/y. This tells you that demand is really strong, as customer pay gross profit was up 9.2% (indicating customers' willingness to pay for services, even if it's out of pocket), and warranty work was up 10.8% (indicating LAD taking on more warranty work). I like the aftermarket revenue more than the new/used vehicle sales because it is recurring in nature and, in a sense, macro-cycle-resistant. During both good and bad times, if your car breaks down, you are sending it for servicing almost all the time, and this gives LAD good earnings visibility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On vehicle sales, while new vehicle sales were bad, used vehicle demand, especially in the value segment, is helping LAD to capture demand. My sense is that consumers are \"trading down\" effectively. Instead of paying for a full-price vehicle, those that need a vehicle are opting for cheaper alternatives, and used vehicles are generally the best alternative here (instead of buying a broken car and fixing it yourself). The momentum so far is good too. Same-store used units grew 6.3% y/y in Q3, and with retail volumes already tracking up 10% quarter-to-date in October, this recovery strength should continue into Q4.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Negative Aspects and Potential Concerns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not everything is smooth sailing, though. I do see areas that are concerning, especially the weak vehicle gross profits, which is the most visible headwind. Same-store sales are good and fine, but it is just not a good look fundamentally when the new vehicle GPU is declining at double-digits (down 10.8% y/y to $2,867), and the used vehicle GPU is down 4.8% y/y to $1,767. For context, these are multi-year lows for LAD. The saving grace is that this is not just limited to LAD. The entire industry is facing a similar issue (per management in the Q3 2025 transcript), but this doesn't mean it is a good thing. This is still an earnings headwind, and the fact that overall gross profit only grew 2.5% goes to show how significant this headwind is.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The problem I have is the lack of clarity into when the cycle will turn. Would it get better next month? Next quarter? Or even late next year? Between now and then, if GPUs continue to decline while volume does not pick up, earnings growth could literally turn negative despite positive top-line momentum.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One key factor to keep in mind is that part of the Q3 new vehicle strength may have been influenced by a one-off event (the expiration of certain US EV tax credits in late September). We do not know the exact volume impact, but management did note seeing an end-of-quarter sales push to clear qualifying inventory, which helped drive a ~40% lease penetration rate for new vehicles. Which means we don't really know the like-for-like growth, but given that this one-off tailwind is unlikely to happen again, it is reasonable to believe that volume growth is going to turn sequentially weaker. LAD could surprise us with better volume performance, but if GPU declines and headline new vehicle sales volume falls, the stock sentiment is not going to be good.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Taking a step back, I guess the high-level concern is consumer affordability, and I also do not have a view on when it will get better. The elevated interest rate narrative has been running on for quite some time already, and coupled with uncertain trade policies, it seems more than likely that consumers will continue to stay cautious on spending. This really hurts demand for new models (pricier), and as much as LAD is pivoting focus on the used vehicle segment, new vehicle retail is still the majority of revenue. Any decline will have a huge impact on consolidated sales.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"664\" data-height=\"330\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A graph of stock market AI-generated content may be incorrect.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"318\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/29/60305098-17617279978662126_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Bloomberg</p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">LAD has historically traded very well in line with its revenue growth outlook. Adjusting away the extreme high growth rates seen during the post-covid period, the median revenue growth should be somewhere in the high-single-digits to low-teens percentage, and LAD is at low-single-digits today. There are a few occasions where LAD had this similar level of growth outlook: in 2019 (traded at ~10x forward PE) and during covid (stock traded down to 6x). As I write this post, LAD trades at 8.5x forward PE, which I think is a fair multiple relative to history. The bottom line is that vehicle sales have to not only grow but also come with better unit economics. Until then, I think LAD continues to trade at where it is today.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My view on LAD is neutral. While there are positive aspects of the business, the main worry I have is that headwinds tied to weak GPU and consumer affordability will continue to dominate the narrative, and that puts pressure on the stock valuation. If the GPU continues to get worse, so much so that it causes earnings to decline despite top-line growth, that would likely drive multiples downward as investors start to model in further earnings decline until the cycle turns.</p>",
