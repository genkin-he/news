AIRR has performed exceptionally well in<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> recent years, in part due to the renewed growth environment for power, water, and data center infrastructure, leading to a substantial increase in construction projects that has facilitated growth across the market. Within the industrials sector, AIRR will primarily provide investors with exposure to the engineering, procurement, and construction [EPC] industry.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why Invest in AIRR</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AIRR has gained strong momentum in recent years as a result of renewed growth for <a href=\"https://www.ismworld.org/supply-management-news-and-reports/reports/ism-pmi-reports/pmi/january/\" rel=\"nofollow\">industrial construction projects</a> led by large-scale data center developments and supporting infrastructure for power &amp; water. As a result of this heightened demand, EPCs have experienced substantial growth in orders, expanding backlogs that support future operational growth. Despite the strong market environment, the industry may be faced with certain bottlenecks that may influence the pace of growth, including labor constraints, materials costs, and volatility in the supply chain (resulting from tariff uncertainty).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Market constraints may not necessarily be diminishing earnings in the industry, given that this is experienced across the entire domestic market. This has, in part, led to greater pricing power being turned over to the EPCs, providing improved operating leverage in a labor-intensive industry. This has also led to robust backlog growth, providing more certainty regarding project planning and revenue growth. For example, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4554820-comfort-systems-usa-outlines-plans-to-grow-modular-capacity-to-4m-sq-ft-amid-strong\">Comfort Systems USA, Inc.</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FIX\" title=\"Comfort Systems USA, Inc.\">FIX</a>), the largest position in AIRR at 3.99% of net assets, reported record earnings and backlog in Q4 2025, supporting record gross margins. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4514517-sterling-infrastructure-targets-27-percent-revenue-growth-for-2025-while-expanding-e\">Sterling Infrastructure, Inc.</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STRL\" title=\"Sterling Infrastructure, Inc.\">STRL</a>), the second largest holding at 3.93%, reported similar margin-accretive growth and an expanded backlog back in November 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One factor that may impact the timing of projects is materials availability and costs. Though EPCs generally pass through materials costs to the end customers, costs may impact project timing if customers exhibit some constraints in the capital budgets. This could potentially add some unevenness to growth across the industry from quarter to quarter; however, given that many of these projects are multi-year projects, I believe this unevenness may be relatively muted. Availability of materials may have a greater impact on the market relative to pricing, particularly for electrical components, which have been in short supply for the last 7 months in accordance with the <a href=\"https://www.ismworld.org/supply-management-news-and-reports/reports/ism-pmi-reports/pmi/january/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ISM-PMI Manufacturing Index</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other factor that may impact the industry is labor constraints. A tight labor market for construction workers may create some pricing power for the employees and labor unions during salary negotiations, which may ultimately impact the EPC market when the current cycle begins to conclude.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I believe AIRR may be a great investment opportunity given the durable growth outlay for the EPC market. With increasing backlogs and improving conversion rates, I believe the industry may experience structural growth through at least the end of the decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a trading perspective, AIRR has substantially outperformed the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Futures\">SPX</a>) in the last year as a result of the improving market environment. As a result of the strong share price return of the underlying portfolio, AIRR exhibits a relatively high trading premium at 30.40x price/earnings, well above the <a href=\"https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/state-street-spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy?WT.mc_id=ps_etf-spy_spy-funds_us_google_text_psb_mf2_lp_jan26&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;&amp;_bt=750603212291&amp;_bk=state%20street%20spy&amp;_bm=e&amp;_bn=g&amp;_bg=76959821468&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=1750358613&amp;gbraid=0AAAAACz5AuMTEBjy2gq0uPZs1vtlIoPL_&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAtfXMBhDzARIsAJ0jp3Dj_2gRJuZlF_lyjFZr91z9HTgrXB2-MtlqeBOUGjJvmUvaSKxqS68aAqrwEALw_wcB\" rel=\"nofollow\">S&amp;P 500’s</a> valuation of 27.55x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/16009792-17719873661029932_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1430\" data-height=\"769\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/16009792-17719873661029932_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"TradingView\" width=\"640\" height=\"344\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/16009792-17719873661029932_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/16009792-17719873661029932_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/16009792-17719873661029932_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/16009792-17719873661029932_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>TradingView</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Though valuation should be considered when evaluating whether AIRR is a good buying opportunity, the underlying companies’ valuations have historically traded at a relative premium during cyclical upswings. The best indicator for investors to consider when investing in AIRR is backlog growth and book-to-bill ratios, or the ratio of new bookings to revenue generated in the quarter or fiscal year. The book-to-bill ratio indicated whether the company brought in more orders relative to backlog and revenue conversion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/16009792-1771987366793461_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1300\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/16009792-1771987366793461_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha\" width=\"640\" height=\"222\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/16009792-1771987366793461_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/16009792-1771987366793461_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/16009792-1771987366793461_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/24/16009792-1771987366793461_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A complementary ETF would be the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4873033-pave-old-economy-paving-way-for-growth\">Global X US Infrastructure Development ETF</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PAVE\" title=\"Global X US Infrastructure Development ETF\">PAVE</a>), a strategy designed to provide exposure to companies that design and manufacture components used in large industrial and construction projects that may be facilitated by companies held in AIRR. From a valuation perspective, AIRR is slightly more expensive with an aggregate price/earnings ratio of 30.40x, whereas PAVE has a valuation of 29.93x. Despite the relatively high premiums, I believe both strategies exhibit strong growth potential in terms of pricing power and market growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is some overlap between the two portfolios in which PAVE will provide exposure to Sterling Infrastructure, though the weighting is drastically different, with STRL shares accounting for 3.93% of AIRR and 0.73% of PAVE. Other companies that can be found in both portfolios include Everus Construction Group, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ECG\" title=\"Everus Construction Group, Inc.\">ECG</a>), Arcosa, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ACA\" title=\"Arcosa, Inc.\">ACA</a>), Argan, Inc.

From a subsector concentration perspective, AIRR will provide a greater concentration in EPC firms, whereas PAVE prioritizes more heavily parts and components, with the exception of its largest holding, Quanta Services, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PWR\" title=\"Quanta Services, Inc.\">PWR</a>), at 3.37%. From an investment perspective, PAVE may benefit from tighter supply chains and pricing power of industrial components. Given the increasing demand for EPC services, AIRR may also benefit from a tight market while mitigating material costs to the end customer.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">About First Trust RBA American Industrial Renaissance® ETF</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"http://www.ftportfolios.com/Common/ContentFileLoader.aspx?ContentGUID=2fc94288-3188-4204-a731-1959c7a65e63\" rel=\"nofollow\">AIRR</a> was launched by First Trust on March 10, 2014, on the Nasdaq Exchange.

The Index tracks the performance of small- and mid-cap US companies in the industrials and community banking sectors. RBA uses a cyclical approach to balancing the Index, adjusting exposure to manage risk through the business cycle. This means that the Index actively manages risk throughout the boom and bust cycles the industry experiences over time, concentrating more heavily in small-cap value stocks during growth cycles and large-cap stocks for stability and durability during easing cycles. Given the portfolio's current positioning, one may infer that the market is currently undergoing a growth cycle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_profit-cycle-for-web.png?io=w640\" alt=\"RBA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"750\" height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_profit-cycle-for-web.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_profit-cycle-for-web.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_profit-cycle-for-web.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_profit-cycle-for-web.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_profit-cycle-for-web.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>RBA</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks Related to AIRR</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AIRR may expose investors to certain risks that should be considered prior to making a final investment decision. AIRR is concentrated in a specific industry within the industrials sector, potentially exposing investors to concentration risk. AIRR primarily invests in US-domiciled companies, exposing investors to a singular market environment that may present greater cyclical risk. Investors must be mindful of company backlogs and new order intake in order to determine the health of the industry and whether it will continue to grow.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h3> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AIRR presents investors with appealing exposure to the EPC market, which I anticipate will continue to experience market-leading growth for the coming years. With heightened demand for EPC services for power, water, and data center construction projects, I believe the market environment will remain strong for the subsector, leading to consistent growth over the coming years. Despite the high trading premium of the portfolio, EPC firms have historically traded at a relative premium over the broader market index, potentially exhibiting limited abnormal risk by historical trends. With the market exhibiting strong growth tailwinds, I'm expecting AIRR to outperform the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPY\" title=\"State Street SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust\">SPY</a>) for the time being, particularly given the growing uncertainty regarding the mega-cap technology stocks held within the broader index. Given the robust outlook for the market, I am recommending AIRR with a Buy rating with a target allocation of 2-4%.</p>",

The stock just fell ~15% after reporting a disastrous Q4 earnings print, and I expect weakness to sustain well into 2026.</span></p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_5af4215f8d5f6aa552a47e70c0e2aa13.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_5af4215f8d5f6aa552a47e70c0e2aa13.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_5af4215f8d5f6aa552a47e70c0e2aa13.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_5af4215f8d5f6aa552a47e70c0e2aa13.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4848812-carscom-flailing-stock-with-zero-growth\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4848812-carscom-flailing-stock-with-zero-growth\" target=\"_blank\">I last wrote a \"Sell\" article on Cars.com</a> in November, when the stock was trading in the mid-$11s. Since then, Cars.com has seen a substantial erosion in value. But unlike the senseless corrections we are seeing elsewhere in the tech sector, we can see plain justification for Cars.com's pullback in its latest results. Growth continues to lag substantially behind its nearest peer, CarGurus (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CARG\" title=\"CarGurus, Inc.\">CARG</a>), while the company's positioning not just with wholesale clients but with consumers/car shoppers also appears to be declining. I continue to reiterate my \"Sell\"<strong> </strong>rating on this name.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To me, Cars.com is a grab bag of inescapable risks. The core red flags that investors need to watch out for are:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Cars.com is barely growing. There's an old yet simple adage: don't trust a tech company that's not growing. Cars.com has generated low-single-digit revenue growth for quite some time, and it's not expecting to improve beyond this in 2026. Meanwhile, the company's core competitor and <span>No. </span>1 used car marketplace, CarGurus, is racing ahead with much healthier results.</li> <li>Traffic is declining. As a reminder, Cars.com's primary monetization is from paying car dealerships, which utilize Cars.com as an online marketing channel. But ultimately, Cars.com's value is limited to the consumer traffic it can bring in, and currently, that's declining. With Cars.com getting fewer eyeballs, dealers may also be able to negotiate more favorable terms.</li> <li>Dis-economies of scale. Cars.com is suffering from a pullback in operating and adjusted EBITDA margins, as costs rise while revenue remains stagnant.</li> <li>Debt burden. The company is shouldering about $0.4 billion of net debt while also having very thin cash resources on its balance sheet, reducing its financial flexibility.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Really the only thing that Cars.com has going for it is its cheapness. At current share prices near $9, Cars.com trades at a market cap of $543.1 million. Netting off the $56.2 million of cash and $451.5 million of debt on the company's latest balance sheet gives us an enterprise value of $938.4 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For FY26, Cars.com is guiding to just 0%-2% y/y revenue growth, which indicates a range of $723.2-$737.7 million. It's also calling for a 29%-30% adjusted EBITDA margin (versus a 29.2% margin in FY25), indicating a midpoint of $215.5 million in adjusted EBITDA (+2% y/y) at 1% revenue growth.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-1772178083452235_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2346\" data-height=\"1018\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-1772178083452235_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cars.com outlook\" width=\"640\" height=\"278\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"278\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-1772178083452235_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-1772178083452235_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-1772178083452235_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-1772178083452235_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cars.com outlook <span>(Cars.com Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This positions Cars.com's valuation at 4.4x EV/FY26 adjusted EBITDA. Needless to say, this is cheap. But at the same time, cheap small- and mid-cap stocks are now littered in the stock market. We find equally strong bargains in much higher-quality businesses such as RingCentral (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RNG\" title=\"RingCentral, Inc.\">RNG</a>), Talkspace (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TALK\" title=\"Talkspace, Inc.\">TALK</a>), eToro (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ETOR\" title=\"eToro Group Ltd.\">ETOR</a>), and direct competitor CarGurus.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In other words, don't get caught buying a value trap here.

The company continues to grow its dealer business, but its direct relationships with OEMs (automakers) continue to be a headwind as carmakers pull back on their marketing budgets. This has driven OE revenue down 8% y/y to $16.2 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I find most punishing about Cars.com's quarter, however, is the decline in traffic stats for its website. Average monthly unique visitors are down 6% y/y and 15% quarter-over-quarter to 21.7 million. Meanwhile, overall traffic in terms of views declined 3% y/y and 11% sequentially to 138.8 million.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-17721781219113948_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1966\" data-height=\"450\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-17721781219113948_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cars.com business metrics\" width=\"640\" height=\"146\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"146\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-17721781219113948_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-17721781219113948_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-17721781219113948_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/33427965-17721781219113948_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cars.com business metrics <span>(Cars.com Q4 earnings deck)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We note that CarGurus, which still claims itself to be the No. 1 used car marketplace, no longer reports exact traffic measures but noted on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872610-cargurus-inc-carg-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872610-cargurus-inc-carg-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">Q4 earnings call</a> that traffic is growing (at an unspecified rate).

For its upcoming fiscal first quarter, Nvidia expects revenue of approximately $78B. Analysts had<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> expected the company to generate $72.78B in revenue.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557606-nvidia-stands-alone-upbeat-outlook-sends-stock-higher-leaving-mag-7-in-the-red\">stock price dropped</a> more than 5%.

PEG = PE / Expected EPS Growth. So, if a company has a P/E of 25 and is expected to grow earnings at 15% annually, its PEG is 25/15 = 1.67. Rather than repeat my description of the importance of PEG valuation for growth companies, I refer you to my two previous articles:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802375-categorizing-tech-companies-valuation-risk\">Categorizing Tech Companies' Valuation Risk</a>.</li> <li> <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4802375-categorizing-tech-companies-valuation-risk\">Nvidia: It's All About Growth</a>.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most important thing to remember is that a lower PEG is better, and 1.0 is the \"normal\" target.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below is my recomputed PEG ratios for the top tech companies. I also included forward P/E as a reference and compared the companies' PEGs from last year to this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/30457345-1772134883034026_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"896\" data-height=\"878\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/30457345-1772134883034026_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"PEG\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"627\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/30457345-1772134883034026_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/30457345-1772134883034026_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/30457345-1772134883034026_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/30457345-1772134883034026_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Comparative PEG Ratios <span>(Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There was a significant improvement in PEGs overall, as reflected in median and average. This actually means that tech investments are less risky based on this measurement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I classified them into four categories:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Dark Green</strong> - These have a PEG of less than 1.0, so they have a P/E ratio reasonably balanced to their expected growth. These appear to be the most promising investment opportunities. I own all four of these stocks and will continue to hold them, possibly increasing my position.</li> <li> <strong>Light Green</strong> - These six companies have higher PEG ratios but remain below 2.0. I own all of these and will continue to own them, but I’ll keep an eye on them.</li> <li> <strong>Orange</strong> - With a PEG between 2.0 and 3.0, these companies are in a danger zone. I own IBM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\" title=\"International Business Machines Corporation\">IBM</a>) and Cisco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSCO\" title=\"Cisco Systems, Inc.\">CSCO</a>) and will look at them more closely.</li> <li> <strong>Red</strong> – With a PEG greater than 3.0, I consider these stocks to have P/E ratios may not be justified by their growth expectations. I own Apple but may reduce my position depending on its new product announcements next week, even though it's one of my favorite stocks. I have a short position in Tesla (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA\" title=\"Tesla, Inc.\">TSLA</a>).</li> </ol> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Nvidia's Improved PEG Ratio</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The combination of significant revenue and earnings growth, lower stock price growth in the last nine months, and today's price decline has made Nvidia a stronger buy. Its forward P/E is now below 25X, down from 39.7X in my previous article.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More importantly, its PEG ratio is now well below 1.0 at 0.66, making. it one of the lowest in the comparison. In fact, it's now half of what it was nine months ago (1.36). Nvidia has already grown into its valuation.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Observations on the Other Companies</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are some other important observations as well.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) now has an impressive PEG of 0.66 as well.</li> <li>All companies in the chart, except Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) and Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), have improved their PEGs, and the average and median PEGs have improved substantially. This makes me more comfortable with tech industry investments.</li> <li>Apple is a concern, and you need to watch its upcoming growth expectations.</li> <li>Tesla is still way overvalued.</li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the tech companies are growing into their valuations, reducing valuation risk. Regarding Nvidia, it's an obvious Buy right now. There is, of course, risk in getting comfortable with its growth expectations, although at its current forward P/E and increased guidance it seems less risky to me.</p>",

Today, the fund's share<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> price has slid to a rather attractive discount relative to its net asset value per share. I believe that makes it a more interesting prospect today, though, looking back since our last write-up, that would have put some negative pressure on the fund's total returns. Further, if we look back further, the current discount still isn't looking like the bargain it may appear at first.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">MCN Basics</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>1-Year Z-score: -0.54</li> <li>Discount/Premium: -6.26%</li> <li>Distribution Yield: 11.73%</li> <li>Expense Ratio: 1.10%</li> <li>Leverage: N/A</li> <li>Managed Assets: $138.339 million</li> <li>Structure: Perpetual</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MCN's <a href=\"https://xainvestments.com/mcn/\" rel=\"nofollow\">investment objective</a> is \"a high level of current income with a secondary objective of long-term capital appreciation...\" They look to achieve this with an \"actively managed equity portfolio comprised of individual stocks and covered call options.\" Additionally, the fund will \"pursue its investment objectives by investing in a portfolio consisting primarily of high-quality, large- and mid-capitalization stocks that are, in the view of the fund's investment sub-adviser, selling at a reasonable price in relation to their long-term earnings growth rates.\"</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Performance - Discount Opens Up</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since our last write-up, the fund has seen relatively weaker total returns compared to the S&amp;P 500 Index. This would have been partially due to the fund going from a premium to a discount. That would have resulted in the total share price returns being relatively weaker than the total NAV returns. At the same time, there were still some slightly positive total returns during this period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720299849044454.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MCN Performance Since Prior Update\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"259\" height=\"381\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720299849044454.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MCN Performance Since Prior Update <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some could also easily argue that the S&amp;P 500 Index is not a directly appropriate benchmark by which to measure MCN. That is quite true as the fund takes a much more balanced approach in terms of sector allocation—it is not so heavily technology-tilted as the major equity index.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Further, the fund employs an overwrite strategy. To factor this in, the fund provides a benchmark of the CBOE S&amp;P 500 Buy/Write Index instead. Relative to that, MCN has delivered results that have been rather competitive over the longer term, but shorter-term results have fallen short.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003631820219_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"994\" data-height=\"343\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003631820219_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MCN Annualized Performance\" width=\"640\" height=\"221\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"221\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003631820219_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003631820219_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003631820219_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003631820219_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MCN Annualized Performance <span>(XA Investments)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Worth noting is that in 2024, the fund's name changed and the advisor changed; however, the same management team remained the sub-advisor, and the investment strategy of the fund remained the same.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In looking at the longer-term history of the fund's valuation, the current discount presents a more attractive entry price. However, it is also worth noting that the fund traded at a relatively outsized premium for a handful of years—this would have naturally reduced the overall average level of the last decade. Before around 2021, an 8%-12% discount was not all that unusual.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_37ba4c19e098c1a056c28dbe72101e94.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"424\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_37ba4c19e098c1a056c28dbe72101e94.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_37ba4c19e098c1a056c28dbe72101e94.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_37ba4c19e098c1a056c28dbe72101e94.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ycharts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, while in the short term it presents an enticing time to enter a position, I am not leaning overly bullish quite yet.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Distribution - Double-Digit Looking Tempting</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of the distribution, they actually switched to a monthly payout since we last touched on this fund. This is often seen as more attractive for income-focused investors, and they also kept the same equivalent amount being paid out—simply going from $0.18 quarterly to $0.06 per month. Based on the current rate and price, the distribution yield comes in at a tempting 11.73%. On a NAV basis, this is a touch lower at 10.99%, thanks to the discount opening up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720312497594328_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MCN Distribution History\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"278\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720312497594328_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720312497594328_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720312497594328_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720312497594328_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MCN Distribution History <span>(CEFConnect)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, I had a similar warning during our last update that the fund's distribution is quite tempting, but this is fairly elevated for a call writing fund, at least relative to its CEF peers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the same time, they have paid out this same amount since going back to the Global Financial Crisis, so clearly, this is a level that they would like to maintain. After all, the longer they can keep it at this level, the more likely it is that the fund may return to a premium again one day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The downside of this is that it becomes more difficult to continue to achieve the returns necessary. As an equity-focused fund, to cover the payout, it will require substantial capital gains to be generated. That can come via the underlying portfolio or the call-writing strategy. Should that not be achieved, then that means a slowly eroding NAV over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the case of MCN, the NAV has been slowly heading downward since the end of 2021 to its latest fiscal year end, 2025. This is usually not a great sign, as it would indicate some difficulty in covering its payout from the income and appreciation necessary.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003231001306_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1662\" data-height=\"723\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003231001306_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MCN Financial Highlights\" width=\"640\" height=\"278\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"278\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003231001306_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003231001306_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003231001306_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/1058901-17722003231001306_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MCN Financial Highlights <span>(XA Investments)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, that's why I believe the current distribution rate is not only elevated at a double-digit rate, which tends to be the rather common-sense red flag level, but also based on what the fund has been able to achieve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of tax purposes, the fund has classified the distribution primarily as ordinary income, but also as return of capital.

The latest puts it at 86.5%, with the number of equity positions at 40 and option holdings at 44. The average contract length is also on the longer end relative to most peers that I look at in the call writing fund space, with MCN's average contract length at over 46 days. Eaton Vance, for example, often rolls contracts every two weeks. For the NEOS ETFs that have become quite popular, they write options monthly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720304389107246.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MCN Fund Characteristics\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"531\" height=\"225\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720304389107246.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720304389107246.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720304389107246.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MCN Fund Characteristics <span>(XA Investments)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What key piece of information that is missing on the stats here would be how far out-of-the-money, or perhaps even, in-the-money, these contracts are. That could indicate potentially how much upside the underlying positions could participate in before they reach the covered call upside cap. Given the fund is heavily overwritten, this could be quite meaningful. On the other hand, the longer average contract lengths likely mean they can write a bit further OTM, while still collecting a decent chunk of premium.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of sector weighting, information technology is the largest slice of the pie here, but it isn't overly overweight in the sector. Healthcare, financials, consumer staples, and energy all also come in quite closely in terms of their exposure as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720306288494692_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MCN Industry Allocation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"403\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720306288494692_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720306288494692_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720306288494692_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720306288494692_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MCN Industry Allocation <span>(XA Investments)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that, one of the more appropriate comparisons of MCN could be to a fund like the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantaged ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RSPA\" title=\"Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF\">RSPA</a>). When looking back at the performance, we are quite limited due to RSPA's inception being in mid-2024. That said, so far, the results heavily favor RSPA—that's even pretty meaningful in terms of the total NAV returns, MCN has slipped quite a bit, relatively speaking.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_1f39a2cadc63e8bf931e60581c0a3344.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"635\" height=\"525\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_1f39a2cadc63e8bf931e60581c0a3344.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_1f39a2cadc63e8bf931e60581c0a3344.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/saupload_1f39a2cadc63e8bf931e60581c0a3344.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Ycharts</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While this is past performance, it at least indicates a relatively poor result so far. That could always change moving forward, but I think it also highlights the fact that an even larger discount would be necessary for MCN before it starts to become worthwhile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In looking at the top ten, the allocations are fairly hefty, with these representing just over 33.3% of the overall investments of the portfolio. At only 40 equity positions, this also isn't that unexpected.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of unique exposure, I think the box is checked here. There are not many funds that have this assortment of top holdings being represented, aside from Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) and Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) being regulars in most funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720308498948846_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"MCN Top Ten Holdings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"196\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720308498948846_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720308498948846_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720308498948846_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/1058901-17720308498948846_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">MCN Top Ten Holdings <span>(XA Investments)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MCN provides investors a fairly unique portfolio with a portfolio that isn't overly emphasizing tech allocation. The fund managers then apply a covered call strategy on top. The fund is heavily overwritten, and that can run into the usual pitfall of covered call funds, limited potential upside due to being capped. The longer-term results of the fund put up competitive results against its benchmark, but the performance in more recent years has begun to falter. Along with that faltering, the fund's total share price returns have been even more negatively impacted, with the fund going from a premium to a discount. At this time, while it becomes a more interesting name to consider, I still wouldn't be looking to buy too aggressively here.</p>",

Aristocrats, on average, have started the year very hot, not all of them are equally attractive investment opportunities at the moment. To identify the most promising Aristocrats, I focus on two key metrics: potential undervaluation and projected long-term total return.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation is assessed using dividend yield theory, which compares the current dividend yield to the 5-year rolling average.

Licensing &amp; Royalties generated $108 million—73% of total revenues. Direct Product Sales were just $39 million. In other words, Novavax is now essentially a royalty collection agency.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While management’s FY26 revenue guide ($230M-$270M) implies a ~75% drop from the $1.1 billion reported for 2025, it’s a cleaner revenue stream. 2025 revenue was primarily composed of “paper gains” from settling old contracts ($625M).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, management’s revenue guidance did<em> not</em> include a potential $125 million milestone from Sanofi’s Phase 3 initiation of the COVID/influenza vaccine and a $75 million milestone from the tech transfer completion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just a few quarters ago, Novavax had “going concern” warnings. But they ended FY25 with $857 million in cash and accounts receivable—enough to fund operations “<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875693-novavax-inc-nvax-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">into 2028</a>.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a much different company. Novavax’s past attempt to scale NUVAXOVID was met with commercial realities like a commoditized vaccination market, powerful competition, and decelerating demand. Today, large partners are paying big, high-margin bucks to utilize their technology.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Part of Novavax’s recent gains are associated with the market beginning to value its stock more like a \"royalty-bearing enabler.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Two comparators that immediately come to my mind include Halozyme (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HALO\" title=\"Halozyme Therapeutics, Inc.\">HALO</a>) and Royalty Pharma (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RPRX\" title=\"Royalty Pharma plc\">RPRX</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047116012585_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"798\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047116012585_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Author's Compilation\" width=\"640\" height=\"249\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047116012585_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047116012585_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047116012585_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047116012585_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Compilation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, for what it is, I think Novavax is properly valued.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike Halozyme and Royalty Pharma—who earn royalties on multiple approved products—Novavax is enjoying the certainty of upfront and near-term milestone payments for now. A lot of the value in the partnerships they’ve struck is “backloaded” and dependent on uncertain clinical trial outcomes. Then—of course—Novavax is much more dependent on any one partner than are Halozyme and Royalty. Finally, Halozyme and Royalty have proven models that have consistently generated cash.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So Novavax should trade at a discount and, honestly, it’s probably a bit early for me to even compare the three. In any event, this is the type of model that Novavax is aiming for.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pipeline</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4875693-novavax-inc-nvax-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">call</a>, “C. diff” was a popular topic—mentioned over a dozen times.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047119480915_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2048\" data-height=\"1326\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047119480915_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SA\" width=\"640\" height=\"414\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047119480915_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047119480915_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047119480915_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48050289-17722047119480915_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's Compilation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike other indications within their <a href=\"https://www.novavax.com/products-pipeline/pipeline\" rel=\"nofollow\">pipeline</a> (pictured above), C. difficile would be a much less crowded market than, say, RSV and shingles. So I think this is why Novavax focused so much on the preclinical prospect.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Previous C. difficile vaccine attempts have <a href=\"https://medicalxpress.com/news/2026-02-experimental-vaccine-diff-disease-recurrence.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">failed</a>. There are a few reasons why. For one, older vaccines aimed to neutralize the toxins produced by the bacteria—leaving folks colonized still. C. difficile is also contained within the GI tract, so vaccine protection requires mucosal immunity. And narrow antigen coverage may have been insufficient.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Novavax is aiming to target a variety of antigens and toxins, as well as curb bacterial colonization. Its Matrix-M technology may help enhance the immune response to hone in on mucosal immunity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Elsewhere, Novavax is hoping to \"shake more hands\" for its internal COVID/influenza and influenza programs. Remember that Novavax prefers to secure a partner rather than funding a large, late-stage program all their lonesome.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Words</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Novavax has “turned a corner,” it’s still a ways from long-term assurance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s goal of \"profitability by 2028” is largely in the hands of Sanofi and the upcoming Phase 3 program for the COVID/influenza vaccine. If that one program slips/produces mediocre data, Novavax would take a hit.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Still, at the end of the day, Novavax’s platform is its “saving grace” and serves as a pungent reminder to the importance of “moat” in this sector. If Novavax was merely dependent on NUVAXOVID as a stand-alone asset, this article would’ve been written in a totally different tone.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, NVAX appears appropriately valued (maintain “Hold”) and is a good candidate for a speculative position within the context of a barbell portfolio given its high-risk/high-reward nature. There is also still potential for regulatory risks—like vaccine misinformation, BLA rejection, and license revocation.</p>",

A lack of execution and past disappointments make it difficult to build conviction, although the company still has time to (partially) recover from this.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some Perspective</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Aspen Aerogels started its corporate history as a provider of industrial insulation activities, this being a $100 million but lossmaking business when the company went public a little over a decade ago. Understanding what happened to the business is key, as multiple boom-bust cycles and strategic pivots explain why the company finds itself where it sits today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the company failed to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability, the company decided to reposition its business to provide solutions for EV batteries. This made it so that a share price of just a dollar ended up rising to a high of $60 in 2021, followed by a pullback to the low single digits in 2023. This was followed by a recovery to the $30 mark in 2024, with shares now back down again at just about $3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These developments came as the company saw strong growth coming out of the pandemic. Revenues rose nearly 50% to $180 million in 2022 as growth slowed to 30% in 2023, yet growth accelerated to triple digits in 2024, which made the production capacity limits of $650 million come within sight.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To facilitate further and continued growth, the company was looking to build a huge new plant, at a nearly $2 billion bill, aided by the help of the DOE and external financiers. All this was driven by a strong 2024, with revenues reported up 90% to $453 million, accompanied by an operating profit of $53 million.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Big Implosion</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the company guided for first quarter sales for 2025 to come in below the hundred million mark, the bigger news was that the company halted construction of its new and giant plant. Revenues quickly fell to a run rate of $300 million, with no realistic operating profits seen anymore.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this stands in sharp contrast to the growth reported in the years before, attributed to oversupply of its solutions to EV manufacturers. Worse, with developments continuing in solid-state batteries, the company could be facing a long-term threat, as such batteries could result in much less demand for its products in the future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conditions remained brutal as third quarter sales of $73 million were still somewhat reasonable at a near $300 million run rate, yet the company guided for fourth-quarter sales to fall to just $45 million, to be accompanied by EBITDA losses of $10 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company claimed that it could reduce EBITDA break-even levels to $200 million while maintaining a gross cash position of at least $100 million, as a new European contract might even bring in $150 million in revenues as soon as 2027.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">More Disappointments</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By the end of February, Aspen <a href=\"https://ir.aerogel.com/news/news-details/2026/Aspen-Aerogels-Inc--Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Financial-Results-and-Recent-Business-Highlights/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.aerogel.com/news/news-details/2026/Aspen-Aerogels-Inc--Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Financial-Results-and-Recent-Business-Highlights/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">delivered</a> disastrous results at the end of the year. Fourth quarter sales imploded to $41 million. Thermal barrier revenues, those being EV insulation revenues, fell to just $16 million, as lower demand no longer provided a valid excuse to call out capacity constraints for the energy industrial business. Revenues of that segment were cut more than in half to $25 million as well. All this weighed heavily on the P&amp;L statement, with gross profits even reported at negative $23 million and GAAP operating losses reported at $70 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Worse, first quarter sales are seen down further to $35-$40 million, with adjusted EBITDA losses seen between minus $10 and $13 million; this actually marks a modest improvement from a negative $18 million number in the fourth quarter as the company works to lower costs. The company actually maintained a net cash position of just more than $50 million here, depending on the exact definition of net debt, as 82 million shares traded around the $3 mark, for a near quarter of a billion equity valuation here.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Now?</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's clear is that expectations are very low, with Aspen's operating assets valued at just around $200 million. Moreover, while near-term losses will continue, some cash inflows are expected as well. In March, the company expects to obtain a $38 million cash payment fro<span class=\"highlighted_text\">m GM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GM\" title=\"General Motors Company\">GM</a>)</span> relating to a commercial settlement relating to EV capacity adjustments. Moreover, a non-binding LOI for the sale of the Georgia facility has been signed (at an unknown price) as the European customer announced in the fourth quarter was identified to be Volvo.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even more extreme, reviews are seen for the commercial growth plans and the capital structure as the company continues to reduce the break-even point of the business. EBITDA breakeven levels for 2025 were seen at $270 million; this number is seen coming down to $200 million in 2026 and even a bit further into 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, sequential revenue growth is seen in 2026, albeit that the bar is low, driven by recovery of GM volumes, greater subsea industrial orders, as well as recovery of the EV market at large.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In between sufficient liquidity, Aspen is not in real financial stress (yet) and certainly has a chance to improve its fortunes, but that requires great efforts, yet fortunately from a position of a net cash position. A combination of continued cost cuts and sequential revenue growth could be helping here, although much progress is needed.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">All this remains highly speculative after investors in Aspen have been burned many times in recent times. While there appears to be a base underneath the business, and the company has some potential triggers, the reality is that the risk-reward might be reasonable, although this is a hugely speculative stance. We have higher conviction ideas at <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/486-value-in-corporate-events/articles\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/486-value-in-corporate-events/articles\" target=\"_blank\">Value in Corporate Events</a>, but will continue to monitor what happens next at the company.</p>",

NVDA delivered a record breaking Q3 with 62.5% YoY revenue growth which took its valuation to less than 20 times forward earnings. The hyperscalers fueled NVDA's growth with massive CapEx investments as they evolved into the core infrastructure provider for the AI era. While Q3 was very strong their Q4 results were incredible and NVDA just broke several all-time records from revenue to profitability. I am more bullish than ever about NVDA as this is one of the cheapest valuations we have seen for the largest company in the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am following up with a new article because I believe that NVDA is mispriced and the current valuation is creating a large opportunity for shareholders.

NVDA just generated $68.13 billion in revenue which was a 19.51% growth rate QoQ and 73.21% YOY. This quarter proved that NVDA is experiencing reaccelerating growth on a YoY basis. In Q3 2024 NVDA reached a 122.4% YoY growth rate which fell sequentially over the next year to 55.60%. In Q3 their revenue growth rate increased by 6.89% to 62.49% and in Q4 the revenue growth rate increased 10.72% to 73.21%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA’s data center division generated $62.3 billion in revenue in Q4 which was a YoY increase of 75%. In Q4 NVDA generated $51.09 billion in gross profit and $42.96 billion in net income which were both new records. NVDA maintained a 75% gross profit margin while increasing their profit margin by 7.08% to 63.06%. NVDA’s revenue growth and margin is expanding on a YoY basis and they just guided for $78 billion in revenue for their Q1 results which would imply that they are expecting a YoY growth rate of 77.02%. The AI buildout isn’t stopping and the market is getting this wrong.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502462666_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1428\" data-height=\"680\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502462666_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NVDA Revenue\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"305\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502462666_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502462666_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502462666_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502462666_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Steven Fiorillo, Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bull case isn’t dependent on one product cycle or one hyperscaler going against the grain as we’re experiencing a structural shift of how work gets done. AI workloads are becoming more inference heavy and more distributed which expands the opportunities for NVDA as their GPUs can be combined with networking, software and full stack systems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA outlined $11B of networking revenue in Q4 and discussed how it led to $31 billion of revenue this year. NVDA is seeing strong adoption in NVLink, Spectrum-X Ethernet, and InfiniBand as their customers are unifying distributed data centers into AI factories. On the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874926-nvidia-corporation-nvda-q4-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a>, NVDA discussed that Blackwell Ultra can deliver up to 50x better performance and 35x lower cost for agentic AI compared to Hopper. They are positioning the Vera Rubin cycle as the next platform that will be a continuation of the AI factory buildout wave. The Rubin platform which is six new chips will target a 10x reduction in inference token cost compared to Blackwell and they are expecting that the hyperscalers will be the first to deploy these systems.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is super bullish for NVDA because the roadmap of future chips are being absorbed as quickly as NVDA can ship them. The way that I am looking at this is that as AI becomes agentic its always on and compute is no longer a one-time training event as it becomes a recurring necessity. We are seeing that networking is scaling which is likely to enhance the flywheel.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501407676_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"742\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501407676_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Hyperscaler CapEx\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"396\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501407676_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501407676_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501407676_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501407676_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Steven Fiorillo, Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reality is that the combination of META, MSFT, AMZN, and GOOGL allocated $140.13 billion towards CapEx in 2023 then increased their spend by 55.04% ($77.14 billion) in 2024 to $217.27 billion. This year the CapEx spend from these companies increased to $357.51 billion as it grew YoY by 65.55% ($140.24 billion). For the 2026 fiscal year, these companies are projecting to allocate $610 billion toward CapEx which is an additional $252.49 billion and a YoY growth rate of 70.63%. These companies have the balance sheets and the cash flow to fund this build out for years to come, and MSFT reports their full year results in the summer while guiding for the next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that they are still in a \"prisoners dilemma\" situation, especially with the advancements in NVDA’s chips. If the Rubin platform can generate a 10x reduction in inference token cost compared to Blackwell and Blackwell deliver up to 50x better performance and 35x lower cost for agentic AI compared to Hopper these companies have no choice but to upgrade unless they all say no. Any company that doesn’t upgrade will be at a disadvantage because they will have to charge more for compute and they won’t deliver advancements as quickly as their peers. NVDA is at the center of the AI revolution and the buildout doesn’t look like it’s stopping anytime soon.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Nvidia’s valuation is dirt cheap at these levels</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/earnings/estimates\">NVDA</a> just got cheaper as the stock is off more than 5% since the earnings print and the street increased their expected forward earnings. NVDA is expected to generate $8.26 of EPS this year and $13.07 in 2028. This is an increased of 58.32% over the next 2 fiscal years which is the most in the Magnificent Seven. NVDA is trading at 22.36 times this years earnings and 14.13 times 2027 earnings. NVDA is now trading at the cheapest valuation in the Magnificent Seven and companies such as Walmart (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WMT\" title=\"Walmart Inc.\">WMT</a>) and Costco (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COST\" title=\"Costco Wholesale Corporation\">COST</a>) are trading at valuations that are double NVDA’s with less than half of the EPS growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that the numbers are showing that NVDA is being mispriced on overblown fears about how much more buildout is left in the AI revolution. At these levels, I believe that NVDA is providing investors with a great opportunity to unlock future value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-1772144851671753_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1171\" data-height=\"260\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-1772144851671753_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NVDA Forward EPS\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"142\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-1772144851671753_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-1772144851671753_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-1772144851671753_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-1772144851671753_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Steven Fiorillo, Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>NVIDIA is becoming the Berkshire Hathaway of technology</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557785-nvidia-confirms-its-finalizing-deal-with-openai\">NVDA</a> confirmed that its finalizing its deal with OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>), and I couldn’t be more excited.

I believe that NVDA is starting to become the Berkshire Hathaway (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.A\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.A</a>) of technology, and believe that they should make more investments throughout the AI ecosystem as this is likely to be the largest technological revolution the world has ever seen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The real question is what does a company do when they are generating $14.32 billion in net income per month? In <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20414347-nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2026\">Q4, NVDA</a> generated $42.96 billion in net income which is $14.32 billion per month and on an annualized basis they generated $120.07 billion in net income for the year which was $2.31 billion per week. Based on the Q4 results, NVDA is on a run rate of $171.84 billion in net income for this fiscal year, which is 3.3 billion per week of pure profit. Companies can buy back shares, pay down debt, pay dividends, reinvest in themselves, or make investments with their treasure trove of profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA has $7.47 billion in long-term debt on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a> with $62.56 billion in cash on hand. They are already buying back <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/cash-flow-statement\">$48.03 billion</a> worth of shares. As a shareholder I love the idea of NVDA making investments into companies such as OpenAI and CRWV and hope it doesn’t stop there.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502681885_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1268\" data-height=\"825\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502681885_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"CES Presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"416\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502681885_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502681885_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502681885_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448502681885_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Nvidia Corporation </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When NVDA makes an investment into these companies it is trading cash for equity. Currently CRWV is trading at $96.39 which is 10.54% higher than where NVDA purchased $2 billion worth of shares at. This means that NVDA has shares of CRWV that were worth roughly $2.21 billion on the balance sheet, which is a better ROI then plowing the capital into bonds. The current funding round for <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-19/openai-nears-100-billion-funding-at-850-billion-valuation\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenAI</a> will place its valuation at $850 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If NVDA allocated $50 billion towards the deal, they would own 5.88% of OpenAI, and if they allocate $100 billion toward OpenAI they would own 11.76% of the company. An investment of $50 billion or $100 billion is not a small amount but the reality is that both numbers will likely be a fraction of NVDA’s profitability this year. NVDA has the cash to make these investments and if OpenAI becomes a multi trillion dollar company over the next 5-10 years shareholders of NVDA will benefit a great deal by having a significant amount of ownership of it on the balance sheet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The other aspect that many individuals are overlooking is that this isn’t funny accounting. NVDA is making cash investments in these companies for hard equity that sits on their books. What these companies choose to do with that capital is their business. The fact that they will be buying more GPU’s from NVDA is an added bonus that NVDA will recognize 100% of the profits because they already traded the cash for the equity. The sale of the GPU’s is a completely separate transaction.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think that a lot of people believe that NVDA is funding the future sales of GPUs with its own money which isn’t the case. NVDA traded their capital for the equity in these companies and the sale of GPUS will be just an added benefit. Over time I believe that these types of deals will generate a tremendous amount of value for NVDA and their shareholders and I wouldn’t be surprised if we see more deals like this from NVDA in the future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks to investing in Nvidia</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I am bullish on NVDA there are several risk factors to consider. NVDA just delivered 73.21% YoY growth and guided for $78 billion of revenue in Q1 which would be 77.02% YoY growth and the market punished them. Shares are selling off after what could be the best quarter in the history of the stock market as no company this size has ever grew their quarterly revenue by 73% YoY. Even though revenue is reaccelerating the market is clearly concerned about when the revenue growth will slowdown and when the CapEx buildout will turn from expansion to maintenance. NVDA is at the mercy of the hyperscalers deploying CapEx and if the market can convince them that they are spending too much on AI infrastructure the recent selloff after Q4 earnings may look mild compared to what could happen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVDA is a victim of its own success, and the fact that it couldn’t break out after this quarter could be a signal that we have seen a top in its shares. Investors should do their own due diligence, as there isn’t going to be a bell that signals the investments into the AI revolution are curtailing.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was another drop the mic moment for NVDA as their Q4 revenue signaled the reacceleration of growth wasn’t a fluke in Q3. I am shocked that shares sold off more than -5% after earnings as the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/earnings/estimates\">analyst community</a> is signaling that NVDA will deliver roughly $259.34 billion in revenue which is a 66.41% YoY growth rate. NVDA is now trading at the cheapest levels the market has seen is quite some time as investors are able to pay less than 24 times this year earnings and less than 20 times next years earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After reading through the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874926-nvidia-corporation-nvda-q4-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">earnings call</a> and looking at the data from the hyperscalers, I don’t believe we are anywhere close to the AI buildout being over as each generation of NVDA’s chips provide advancements that they are unable to live without. The market is punishing many companies related to the data center buildout which is creating an opportunity for long-term investors. While the markets can be irrational at times I believe that shares of NVDA will rebound and have a good chance of reaching $250 in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501352518_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1213\" data-height=\"339\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501352518_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"NVDA Forward Revenue\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"179\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501352518_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501352518_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501352518_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/12629971-17721448501352518_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The Q&amp;A starts. And within minutes, someone asks the question that always shows up:</p> <p><em>“Why is it down?”</em></p> <p>Sometimes it’s a stock you own. Sometimes it’s one you’re watching. Sometimes it’s a<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> company that </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content\">shouldn’t</em><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> be down because, on paper, it looks “fine.” The dividend is still getting paid. The business isn’t bankrupt. Yet, the market has decided to take a chunk out of the price.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here’s the thing: a stock can be down for a dozen reasons - and most investors look in the wrong place first. They hunt for a headline, a tweet, or a hot take. That approach usually creates more stress than clarity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What you want instead is a repeatable process. One you can use every time a stock drops, whether it’s down 5% in a day or 25% over six months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s walk through the exact checklist I use to answer “Why is it down?” - and more importantly, to decide whether it’s a <em>problem</em>... or an <em>opportunity</em>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 1: Let the Numbers Speak First (but don’t stop there)</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before you read opinions, read facts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Start with the basics: <em>revenue, profit, and the dividend</em>. In most cases, one of those three will explain the move (or at least point you in the right direction).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A stock is often down because the latest results show one of these:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue slowed, declined, or missed expectations</li> <li>Earnings dropped (or the market thinks they will)</li> <li>Margins compressed (costs rose faster than sales)</li> <li>Management guided lower for the next quarter or year</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Compare the right periods.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Year-over-year (Q1 vs. Q1 last year) is usually the cleanest comparison, because businesses are seasonal. Ski companies don’t sell skis in July, and hardware stores don’t move snowblowers in May.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sometimes management highlights sequential improvement (Q1 vs. Q4) if last year’s quarter was unusually strong or weak. That can be useful, but your default should be year-over-year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 2: Go Deeper into the Quarterly Earnings Story</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Once you’ve spotted what moved, the next job is to find <em>why</em>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is where most investors stop too early. They read: “EPS down 12%” and assume the company is in trouble. But “EPS down” can mean many different things.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here are common scenarios that push stocks lower:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Revenue is stable, but EPS is falling.</strong>That’s often a margin story. Input costs, wages, shipping, marketing, or discounting ate into profits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Revenue is rising, but EPS is shrinking.</strong>This can happen when growth comes with costs: a new product rollout, an expansion, or an acquisition that hasn’t paid off yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>EPS dropped because of “one-time” items.</strong>Impairment charges, restructuring costs, legal settlements, or write-downs can crush reported earnings. They may not be recurring - but they still matter because they signal something changed.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">And one important reminder: EPS isn’t always the best metric.</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For capital-intensive businesses (pipelines, utilities, telecoms) and REITs, earnings can look ugly due to depreciation and other non-cash items. In those cases, metrics like DCF per share, FFO per share, or AFFO per share may tell the real story. If you judge the wrong business with the wrong tool, you’ll draw the wrong conclusion.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 3: Use the Dividend Triangle as Your Health Check</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When a stock is down, your brain wants to stare at the price chart. I’d rather you look at the <a href=\"https://thedividendguyblog.com/dividend-triangle/\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">Dividend Triangle</a> and ask three questions:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Are revenues growing?</li> <li>Are earnings (or the right cash metric) growing?</li> <li>Is the dividend growing?</li> </ul> <figure class=\"paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_dividend-triangle.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Dividend triangle representation.\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_dividend-triangle.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_dividend-triangle.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_dividend-triangle.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Dividend triangle representation.</figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But here’s the nuance: metrics alone don’t tell the full story. Trends do.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Two companies can have similar revenue growth this year but very different realities:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>One has a steady, repeatable upward slope.</li> <li>The other is bouncing around with more volatility than your teenager’s mood.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That difference matters. A slowing trend in earnings, or in dividend growth losing steam, is often where the early warning signs appear. The Dividend Triangle <em>trendline</em> tells you whether the business is strengthening or weakening.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 4: Zoom Out - This Is Where You Avoid Dumb Decisions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A single bad quarter is not a trend. It’s a data point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s why you look at 3-5 years of quarterly progression. You’re trying to categorize what you’re seeing:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Blip - One ugly quarter in an otherwise stable upward trend</li> <li>Business as usual - The result looks weak, but it’s within the normal pattern</li> <li>Trend change - Multiple quarters moving in the wrong direction</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is the step that turns panic into perspective. If you skip it, you’re basically letting the market’s mood swing control your portfolio.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 5: Identify the Narrative</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Stocks don’t move on numbers alone. They move on the story investors tell about those numbers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The usual narratives look like this:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Demand is weakening</li> <li>Pricing power is fading</li> <li>Costs are rising</li> <li>Debt is becoming a headwind</li> <li>A major shift is underway</li> <li>A disruptive event hit the business</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Your job is to connect the dots between the numbers and the story. Not to find a comforting explanation - just the most accurate one.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 6: Read CEO Comments Like a Human, Not Like a Fan</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management commentary matters because tone changes before numbers do.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Listen for:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Are they confident and specific - or vague and defensive?</li> <li>Are they taking action - or blaming external forces?</li> <li>Are they raising guidance, maintaining it, or quietly walking it back?</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A great CEO doesn’t promise perfection. They explain what they control, what they don’t, and what they’re doing next.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 7: Check the News, but Filter for Relevance</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sometimes the stock is down for reasons that have nothing to do with that company:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Rate moves hit utilities and REITs</li> <li>A sector selloff hits everything in the group</li> <li>A macro scare triggers a market-wide risk-off mood</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The question isn’t “What’s the headline?” It’s:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Is this company-specific or environment-driven?</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That distinction changes your decision.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Step 8: Expectations Can Be Brutal</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sometimes the market is simply too demanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is where investors get confused: the company reports strong results... and the stock still gets punished.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A perfect example was Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>). After earnings, the stock dropped more than 10% even though it delivered revenue growth of 17%, cloud growth of 29%, and an EPS increase of 24%. Apparently, that wasn’t “good enough.” The issue wasn’t the quarter - it was <em>expectations</em>, valuation, and investor nerves around massive AI capex and when the payoff shows up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I explained that whole setup in my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872805-volatility-starting-year-january-2026-dividend-income-report\">January Dividend Income Report</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s the lesson: stocks don’t fall only because results are bad. They fall because results are less impressive than what the market already priced in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When a stock is down, you’re not hunting for a quick explanation. You’re running a process that leads to one of three outcomes:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The business is fine. The price is noisy.</li> <li>The business has a real issue, but it looks fixable.</li> <li>The story is deteriorating and the dividend triangle is cracking.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And here’s the part that brings it all together:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reasons you buy a stock are often the same reasons you eventually sell it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When the core drivers break, the thesis breaks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://thedividendguyblog.com/why-is-it-down-the-investor-question-that-never-goes-away/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

More specifically, my last <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4769029-bhp-group-better-than-vale-if-you-really-want-mining-exposure\">BHP<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> article</span></a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> was published on Mar 20, 2025, and my last </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4778569-rio-tinto-vs-vale-inventory-doesnt-lie\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">RIO article</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> was published on April 27, 2025. Both articles focused on the tariff risks at that point. I gave both stocks a Hold rating due to my outlook for the tariff uncertainties to translate into near-term demand and pricing headwinds for raw materials. Since then, much has changed both in terms of company specifics and macroeconomics. In terms of company specifics, both have released updated earnings reports and new EPS guidance. In terms of macroeconomics, the geopolitical uncertainties and ore prices have also changed considerably.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With these changes, the investment thesis for this follow-up is twofold. First, I will explain why these changes have made both BHP and RIO stocks timely candidates for Ray Dalio’s AWP (All-weather portfolio). Due to their commodity exposure, including these miners in a portfolio can help to hedge against structural shifts in the global economy, particularly inflation. Second, I will argue why between these two mining leaders, BHP emerges as the even better candidate due to its superior operational margins, and also stronger financial strength. These considerations have led me to update my rating on BHP to Buy.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">BHP, RIO, and commodity cycles</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Readers following our approach know that our foundational investing strategy is heavily influenced by Ray Dalio’s thinking. In particular, his AWP framework is designed to perform across all four economic regimes during a macroscopic cycle. Commodities specifically target the rising prices regime featuring elevated inflation. Judging by the changes in commodity prices since my last writings, leadings miners such as BHP and RIO appear very timely under the AWP framework. To wit, the chart below displays the price of global price of iron ore, a major product that is substantial profit stream for both BHP and RIO stocks. Before going into any details, let me first point out the notorious volatilities and cyclicality the prices have demonstrated in its latest boom and bust cycle as shown. In the past 10 years, the price has more than quadrupled (from around $40 per metric ton in 2016 to ~$220 in 2021) and then approximately halved since the 2021 peak.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this overall observation, let’s now focus more on the details in the past 1 year or so. As seen, shortly since my last writings, the ore prices have indeed suffered downward pressure and reached a bottom of around $96 per ton in mid-2025. Since then, the prices have recovered by quite a bit to the current level of $107, an increase of more than 11%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242746452308_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1824\" data-height=\"973\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242746452308_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"341\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242746452308_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242746452308_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242746452308_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242746452308_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With these changes, my assessment is that the contracting phase of the commodity cycle (that started between 2021 and 2022) has largely run its course already. As such, I expect the ore prices to remain stable and should start the recovery phase in the near future. As a reflection, the profit margins of both companies have demonstrated improvements since my last articles as shown in the chart below. In particular, BHP’s gross margin has expanded to 83.09% with the updated financials in its latest earnings report, which started to exceed its 5-year average of 82.2%. From this chart, you can also see the first reason that makes BHP a better fit for the AWP. BHP has demonstrated superior profitability over RIO on most metrics ranging from gross margin, net margin, FCF margin, etc.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270404833_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"935\" data-height=\"446\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270404833_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"305\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270404833_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270404833_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270404833_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270404833_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">BHP and RIO: balance sheet in focus</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For businesses with exposure to highly cyclical earnings, I especially prefer those with a more conservative balanced sheet in general. On this front, BHP is certainly the more favorable candidate for me. To start, BHP features a much higher holistic Altman Z score than RIO. For investors unfamiliar with the concept, the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/altman.asp#:~:text=The%20Altman%20Z%2Dscore%20is%20a%20formula%20for%20determining%20whether,%2C%20solvency%2C%20and%20activity%20ratios.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Altman Z-score</a> is a metric that captures the overall financial strength of a business by factoring multiple parameters across all the financial statements. As a rule of thumb, I like to see a score of 3 or above for businesses with cyclical behavior such as BHP and RIO. The Altman Z scores of for BHP are above this threshold (3.03 per its latest financials), while the for RIO fell a bit short (2.46).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270408985_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"968\" data-height=\"250\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270408985_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"165\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270408985_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270408985_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270408985_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-1772124270408985_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After seeing the forest, let’s examine a tree more closely. The next chart shows BHP and RIO stock's current and historical interest coverage. As seen, BHP Group has demonstrated far safer coverage than RIO in recent years. To wit, its Times Interest Earned ratio climbed from a mid-2024 low of approximately 16x to the current level of more than 25x. Conversely, Rio Tinto’s coverage has deteriorated significantly over the same period, falling from around 18x in mid-2024 to about 13x presently, only about half of BHP’s coverage ratio. With these contrasts, I see BHP in a much better position to reinvest in growth and weather headwinds (such as interest rate risks and commodity price risks).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242705200164_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1308\" data-height=\"484\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242705200164_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"char\" width=\"640\" height=\"237\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242705200164_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242705200164_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242705200164_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242705200164_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">BHP and RIO: valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of valuation, RIO is certainly the more attractive one on this front. To wit, the data below shows BHP’s valuation premium over RIO on several earnings-based metrics. For example, BHP’s Non-GAAP P/E for the current fiscal year stands at 16.66, which is significantly higher than Rio Tinto’s P/E of 11.91 by about 40%. This trend continues into the future fiscal years too.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, my view is that BHP’s valuation is not as expensive as headline P/E ratios suggest relative to RIO due to the differences in profitability metrics and also balance sheets as analyzed above. Higher profitability margins tend to lead into better earing-cash conversion. As a result, BHP’s Price/Cash Flow ratio is about 10.35 only. It is not only far below its P/E ratio but also not that higher when compared to Rio Tinto’s 9.76. The difference is about 7% only, in contrast to the 40% difference in P/E ratios. Further, due to BHP’s better balance sheet strength, EV-based valuation metrics also show a much tighter spread. For example, BHP’s trailing EV/EBITDA is actually lower at 8.61 compared to Rio Tinto’s 9.32.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242704424622_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"902\" data-height=\"307\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242704424622_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"218\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242704424622_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242704424622_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242704424622_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/54495410-17721242704424622_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other risks and final thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Before closing, let me articulate that I am NOT trying to argue that RIO is a bad choice. It is a strong candidate in itself (and hence my reiterated Hold rating). Besides its attractive valuation metrics and also leading position, it also offers a few key differentiate catalysts in my view. To start, Rio Tinto has a large exposure (or even dominance in my view) in the aluminum sector. Besides offering a diversified, this exposure could also offer a hedge against energy cost rises as aluminum production is extremely energy-intensive and Rio Tinto has developed substantially integrated power assets. Additionally, Rio Tinto and Amazon AWS have recently <a href=\"https://www.riotinto.com/en/news/releases/2026/rio-tinto-and-amazon-web-services-collaborate-to-bring-low-carbon-nuton-copper-to-u-s--data-centres\" rel=\"nofollow\">announced</a> a collaboration to bring low-carbon Nuton copper to U.S. data centers (see more details quoted below). I see large odds for this collation to expand with AMZN’s aggressive CAPAX plan in the years ahead.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>TUCSON, Ariz. (Jan 15, 2026): Rio Tinto today announces a strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) that will see AWS become Nuton® Technology’s first customer following the breakthrough industrial-scale deployment of the innovative bioleaching technology at the Johnson Camp copper mine in the U.S. last month.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To close, this reexamination of BHP and RIO is motivated by changes both in terms of company specifics and macroeconomics since my last writings about a year ago. Changes in the former bucket include their updated earnings reports, profit metrics, and valuation ratios. Changes in the latter bucket include ore prices and my assessment of the commodity cycle. These changes have made BHP and RIO stocks both interesting candidates for Ray Dalio’s AWP idea.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see BHP as the even better candidate due to its superior margins and stronger balance sheet. Furthermore, its valuation premium relative to RIO is not as large as on the surface. For these considerations, this reexamining concludes with an upgraded rating on BHP to Buy.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
