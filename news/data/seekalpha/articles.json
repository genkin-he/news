I found that despite its recent missteps, the stock was still trading at a discount. The misstep I am referring<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to was the acquisition of Indoff in May 2023, which was dilutive in terms of operating margins and shifted the company's focus away from expanding its lucrative Private Label portfolio.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since then, GIC has continued to grow its topline better than expected, and more significantly, has expanded its gross margins. While the SD&amp;A increase has been a drag, the YOY improvement in operating margins is a pleasant surprise. While the share price has gained 21% since, I still find GIC to be decently undervalued, both on an intrinsic basis and relative to its peers. For the stock to realize its potential, the management needs to continue this momentum on the top line, keep up the expanded gross margin profile, and successfully navigate the ever-changing tariff situation. If it can successfully accomplish this, the stock still has a good runway ahead of it - getting back to, and hopefully surpassing this time, its all-time high of around <strong>$45</strong>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Investment Thesis</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global Industrial has cultivated a broad customer base over its 75-year history, ranging from small and medium-sized businesses to large enterprises like Walmart and Home Depot. Furthermore, the company has expanded its reach into the B2C segment through digital marketing efforts and continues to broaden its product portfolio and target customer segments, with recent inroads into public sector enterprises. Now, with a new CEO in place, it is re-targeting the larger strategic enterprise and governmental accounts—which tend to be more relationship-based, with higher average order size, and result in repeat customer orders. Being able to grow revenues at 4.8% in 2025 despite a 1% shrink in Q1 and in a year plagued with tariff vagaries is quite an achievement. The company seems to have begun a positive momentum streak, with 14% topline QoQ growth in Q4 and a 100 bps gross margin improvement YOY. This has translated into almost a 100 bps improvement in its operating margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the flip side, the Selling, Distribution &amp; Administrative (SD&amp;A) expenses remain elevated, even more than 2 years after the Indoff acquisition. Given the strategic shift towards “high touch” sales, I reckon the SD&amp;A will continue to be elevated, and therefore, operating margins will stabilize around 7.1%. It is important to note that GIC has managed to improve operating margins to 9% by 2022 from 5.8% in 2017.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Against this backdrop, I ran a <strong><em>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation </em></strong>analysis for GIC. I assumed next year’s topline growth will be a tad lower at 3%, given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty, and will gradually improve to the risk-free rate of 4%. Operating margins are assumed to increase over the period from 6.5% to 7.1%, driven by gross margin improvements. Historically, the company has not needed to invest much in Capex besides maintenance capital and additional working capital needs. I reckon this modus operandi will continue. Finally, the WACC for the company is 8.6%, which is lower than what I used previously, primarily driven by the recent drop in the US risk-free rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong><em>Using these inputs, the model yields an equity value of approximately $47/share. </em></strong>This represents a substantial 40% upside from the current share price of approximately $33.5.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>FCFF Valuation Model ($ million)</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58164074-17721487331540394_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"822\" data-height=\"437\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58164074-17721487331540394_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"DCF Valuation Model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"340\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58164074-17721487331540394_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58164074-17721487331540394_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58164074-17721487331540394_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/58164074-17721487331540394_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author's analysis</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Simulation Results</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Results from the DCF model are highly dependent on the key assumptions outlined.

With GIC currently trading around $33.5, it falls around the 3<sup>rd</sup> percentile of this range, indicating it is significantly underpriced and offers a substantial margin of safety.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Relative Pricing</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To analyze how GIC trades relative to its peers, I selected a group of 23 public companies within the broader industrial distribution space. I regressed commonly used multiples against fundamental value drivers for each multiple. Based on these regression models, I calculated the predicted values of the multiples at which GIC should be trading, given its fundamentals (growth rate, margins, beta, payout ratio, ROC, etc.). I selected multiples where the regression R-squared was relatively high. As shown in the table below, GIC is currently undervalued across all four selected multiples. The valuation range derived from these relative multiples is <strong>$35 - $51</strong>. This confluence of intrinsic and relative valuation provides additional confidence in the thesis that GIC is currently trading at a discount. It should be trading close to its all-time high of around <strong>$45</strong>, which it has hit several times but has failed to break through that ceiling.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><p>Multiple</p></td> <td><p>Predicted Value of Multiple</p></td> <td><p>Equity Price/ share</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>EV/Sales NTM</p></td> <td><p>1.4</p></td> <td><p><strong>$43.8</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>EV/Invested capital</p></td> <td><p>4.7</p></td> <td><p><strong>$38.1</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>EV/EBITDA NTM</p></td> <td><p>15.2</p></td> <td><p><strong>$35.1</strong></p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>P/BV</p></td> <td><p>6.24</p></td> <td><p><strong>$50.6</strong></p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Several important risk factors warrant consideration:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Continued tariff uncertainties—The tariff</strong> situation continues to evolve on an almost weekly basis. With the recent cancellation of IEEPA tariffs came the imposition of 15% tariffs under section 122. These can technically be applied for only 150 days. Hence, in another few months, we are likely to see the scenario changing again. A more significant impact from tariffs, both monetarily and due to increased uncertainty, could severely affect economic activity in North America. The industrial distribution sector would consequently suffer from reduced demand, higher landed costs of products, and increased inventory carrying costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Stalling of Private Label product proliferation—It</strong> is ironic that, though proliferation of private label portfolios is a major driver of gross margin expansion for the company, the initiative seems to have taken a back seat. The very fact that it’s not being mentioned in the prepared remarks or even in the analyst questions during the last few earnings calls is a concern. This is a unique opportunity for the company, and squandering it is not in the inventors’ best interests.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Continued poor performance of Indoff acquisition—For</strong> two years in a row, the SD&amp;A costs have increased and are now running at 28.5% of sales versus a 5-year average of 26.9% prior to the Indoff acquisition. While this may not seem like much, given the low-margin nature of the business, the impact from these 160 bps of underperformance is about 21% in intrinsic value. Even if the company can recover to the 27.5% level in the next 5 years, it would be an accretive ~$4.8 to its value.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I continue to find GIC to be trading at a substantial discount from both an intrinsic value and a relative pricing perspective. It represents a 40% upside potential from its current price of $33.5. GIC has recently (Q4 2025) repurchased 326,000 shares at an average price of $28.50, further strengthening the undervaluation thesis. It has continued on this path in Q1 2026 as well and has authorization to purchase another 1MM shares. With the current momentum from Q4 continuing, the stock has the potential to hit the $45 level again, a feat it has achieved on several occasions. There could still be further upside if management can address some of the risks outlined here.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUT\" title=\"Hut 8 Corp.\">HUT</a></span>) is being valued as if its transformation into a digital infrastructure platform is already complete. It isn't. The company has made genuine progress. It has signed contracts, developed a credible energy pipeline, and achieved<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> compute revenue that more than doubled in fiscal 2025. The stock, however, trades at roughly three times the forward EV/EBITDA multiple of its large-cap mining peers, implying that structural diversification has already shown up in earnings.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Revenue Picture</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hut 8 posted 45% year-over-year revenue growth in <a href=\"https://cdn.kscope.io/844aaf72301af0202a524be04aa938b8.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">fiscal 2025</a>, with total revenue reaching $235.1 million. That puts it in the middle of the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUT/peers/comparison\">large-cap mining peer group</a>. According to Seeking Alpha figures, Riot Platforms, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RIOT\" title=\"Riot Platforms, Inc.\">RIOT</a>) posted 103.6% over the same period. MARA Holdings, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MARA\" title=\"MARA Holdings, Inc.\">MARA</a>) came in at 53.5%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That would be unremarkable if forward profitability was above peers, but Hut 8 is expected to post approximately -14% forward EBITDA growth. Riot stands at 11.7%, and Marathon is at 15.6%. Mid-tier revenue growth and negative forward EBITDA growth at a premium multiple are the main issues here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valued For Future Income</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The valuation gap between Hut 8 and its peers is substantial. The stock trades at 24.7x trailing sales versus 8.9x for Riot and 3.2x for Marathon, and at 31.5x forward EV/EBITDA, roughly three times both peers. Even on a forward EV/sales basis, Hut 8 sits at 16.5x compared with 10.5x for Riot and 6.3x for Marathon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Those multiples price in infrastructure earnings that have yet to contribute significantly to the income statement. With negative forward EBITDA growth, the burden of proof rests on execution rather than current financial performance.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What The Income Statement Actually Shows</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The headline numbers for fiscal 2025 aren’t great, with a net loss of $248 million and an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $135.4 million, compared to net income of $331.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $555.7 million in 2024. However, the swing was driven largely by a $220 million unrealized mark-to-market loss on Bitcoin holdings, reversing a $509.3 million gain the prior year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strip out the mark-to-market change, and the picture is considerably less bleak. Gross margin expanded from 47% to 54%. Q4 2025 revenues grew 179% year-over-year with gross margin expanding from 36% to 60%. The underlying operational trajectory is improving. The reported bottom line simply doesn't reflect it clearly.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That is precisely the problem for anyone trying to support the valuation. As long as Hut 8 holds a significant Bitcoin treasury and mining remains the dominant earnings driver, reported EBITDA will continue to move with the Bitcoin price rather than with operational progress.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Computing Up, Power Down</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The segment mix in 2025 is showing signs of transition. Compute revenue more than doubled to $202.3 million from $80.7 million, driven by ASIC colocation and the Highrise AI GPU cloud business. Compute now accounts for most of the total revenue. Power revenue, meanwhile, declined to $23.2 million from $56.6 million, reflecting the termination of the Ionic Digital managed services agreement.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The compute growth is solid. But the power segment, which is central to the long-term thesis of owning and monetizing energy infrastructure, actually contracted in fiscal 2025. Management attributes this to the <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241204073664/en/Ionic-Digital-Announces-Termination-of-Amended-and-Restated-Management-Services-Agreement-with-Hut-8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ionic termination</a> rather than structural weakness, and that explanation is plausible. But investors need to see power revenue grow, not shrink, for the infrastructure thesis to gain credibility. A company positioning itself as an energy infrastructure platform should, at some point, show growing energy revenue.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Contracts Are Signed</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To be fair to the bull case, recent news on the infrastructure side is genuinely encouraging. In Q4 2025, Hut 8 signed a <a href=\"https://www.hut8.com/news-insights/press-releases/hut-8-signs-15-year-245-mw-ai-data-center-lease-at-river-bend-campus\" rel=\"nofollow\">15-year lease</a> for 245 megawatts of AI data center capacity at its River Bend campus, valued at $7 billion, with payments financially backstopped by Google. The company also <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hut-8-announces-ai-infrastructure-partnership-with-anthropic-and-fluidstack-302644377.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">signed a deal</a> to build an AI data center in Louisiana for Anthropic, with Fluidstack operating the high-performance clusters, a deal management expects to generate roughly $454 million in net operating income annually over the base term. However, income from these deals is not expected to materialize until 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are not vague pipeline announcements. They are signed agreements with creditworthy counterparties. The 8,500-megawatt development pipeline now has real anchors behind it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, signed contracts and recognized net operating income are two different things. The River Bend and Anthropic deals are meaningful de-risking events for the bull case, but they don't resolve the near-term earnings picture. What matters now is execution: whether the infrastructure earnings start flowing through the income statement on schedule and at the margins management has guided to. Until it does, the valuation is still running way ahead of the financials.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Sideways Bitcoin Problem</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If Bitcoin trades sideways from current levels for an extended period, Hut 8's negative forward EBITDA growth becomes even more difficult to reconcile with a 31.5x forward EV/EBITDA multiple.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Post-halving, the operating leverage cuts both ways. Reduced block rewards mean margins are more sensitive to Bitcoin price movements than in prior cycles. The cost to mine one Bitcoin has effectively doubled in reward terms since April 2024. Current margins are holding up because the Bitcoin price has been elevated. Flat Bitcoin means the expansion that would justify the forward multiple simply doesn't arrive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Layer in the mark-to-market dynamics, and the picture gets worse. Flat Bitcoin means no unrealized gain tailwind on treasury holdings. A 20% Bitcoin decline would amplify the problem. Operating leverage works in reverse. EBITDA compresses faster than revenue. Treasury mark-to-market adds downside to already weak reported earnings.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks And Catalysts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The primary downside risk is Bitcoin price weakness combined with negative forward EBITDA growth at an elevated multiple. Multiple compression from current levels could be significant even without operational deterioration. Delays or cost overruns on the development pipeline would compound the problem.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most meaningful catalysts are concrete: River Bend and the Anthropic deal beginning to contribute real earnings, power segment recovery, and greater segment disclosure that isolates recurring infrastructure earnings from mining volatility. Cleaner reporting would itself support valuation stability. Right now, the two are too tangled together to give the market clarity.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hut 8 has made genuine progress. The near-term challenge is that reported earnings remain volatile and Bitcoin-dependent, the power segment contracted in 2025, and the stock trades at a substantial premium across every key valuation metric. The infrastructure income is coming, but is not yet reflected at scale. Until then, the premium valuation requires investors to carry both Bitcoin cyclicality and development execution risk simultaneously, which may be asking a lot. I maintain a Hold rating.</p>",

The S&amp;P 500 Index and Russell 3000 Index, each a measure of U.S. equities, rose 2.66% and 2.40%, respectively. Within the U.S. equity market, there was a broadening of<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> leadership away from the mega-cap technology stocks that had been key drivers of market performance for most of the year. Small-cap stocks produced competitive returns relative to their larger peers after lagging for the majority of 2025, as measured by the 2.19% return of the Russell 2000 Index and the 2.41% return of the Russell 1000 Index. From a style perspective, value-oriented stocks outpaced growth-oriented stocks across the capitalization spectrum. Internationally, the MSCI EAFE Index, measuring developed market equities, returned 4.86%, and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, measuring emerging markets equities, returned 4.73%, each in U.S. dollar terms. Fixed-income market returns were similarly modest but positive across the quality spectrum. Indicators suggesting softer economic growth led the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates twice during the quarter. The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index returned 1.10%. U.S. Treasuries, per the Bloomberg Treasury Index, returned 0.90%, essentially in line with the 0.84% return for investment-grade corporate bonds, per the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Bond Index. Securitized assets, per the Bloomberg U.S. Securitized Index, performed better with a return of 1.68%, with mortgage-backed securities benefiting from a relatively stable interest rate backdrop and low prepayment levels. High-yield corporate bonds, per the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate High Yield Index, returned 1.31%, as the outlook for low default rates remained intact. Emerging markets debt returned 2.40%, as measured by the Bloomberg Emerging Markets USD Aggregate Index. The global fixed-income market, as measured by the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index, returned 0.24%. Commodities returned 5.85%, per the Bloomberg Commodity Index, led by precious metals.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positioning</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Absolute returns in all five portfolios of the Columbia Capital Allocation Series were positive, and, on a relative basis, the Institutional shares of all but the most conservative portfolio outperformed their respective blended benchmarks. Underlying fund manager performance within the equity asset class was the primary driver of performance across the three most aggressive portfolios; effective asset allocation decisions were the primary driver in the two most conservative portfolios. Style decisions detracted in the three most aggressive portfolios and had only a neutral to modestly additive effect in the two most conservative portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Across all five portfolios, overweighted equity exposure, especially overweights to U.S. large- and mid-cap equities, contributed positively, as did underlying fund manager performance in U.S. large- and mid-cap equities. Underlying fund manager performance within international equities detracted slightly across all five portfolios. Allocations to fixed income modestly detracted across all five portfolios, driven primarily by weak underlying fund manager performance within the asset class. Exposure to high-yield corporate bonds, which are out-of-benchmark, detracted across all five portfolios, but exposure to emerging market bonds, also out of benchmark, added value across all five portfolios. Performance across core fixed income was mixed, as negative underlying fund manager performance was offset by positive asset allocation decisions to have rather neutral effect overall in all five portfolios. A modest use of leverage to fund an overweight in equities helped across all five portfolios. Exposure to commodities contributed positively in the three most aggressive portfolios, the only portfolios to hold commodities during the quarter. Active currency positioning detracted across all five portfolios, particularly the decision to be long the Japanese yen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the quarter, we slightly increased the portfolios’ fixed-income exposure, mostly to investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds, and shifted to a moderate underweight to U.S. Treasuries. While the portfolios remained overweight equities versus their respective benchmarks, we modestly decreased equity exposure, reflecting a slightly more cautious approach despite, our constructive outlook for risk assets and viewing the trim as prudent risk management rather than a strategic shift.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the end of the fourth quarter, we believed the market environment remained constructive for risk assets, supported by lower volatility, strong momentum and favorable business conditions. This view led to a moderate equity overweight in the portfolios, with valuation concerns keeping us from a larger overweight to the asset class. Within equities, we maintained high conviction in regional preferences, wherein we favored U.S., Canada and emerging markets equities over Europe, the U.K. and developed Asia ex-Japan. In fixed income, we maintained an overall neutral stance but introduced a pro-credit tilt, given our view of improved conditions for credit markets. Strategically, we believe fixed income will continue to serve as a useful portfolio diversifier, a view reinforced by lower stock/bond correlations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50624080-17722017347708473_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1277\" data-height=\"320\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50624080-17722017347708473_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Conservative Portfolio\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"160\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50624080-17722017347708473_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50624080-17722017347708473_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50624080-17722017347708473_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/50624080-17722017347708473_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw -

The fund’s investment in <strong>other funds</strong> subjects it to the investment performance (positive or negative), risks and expenses of these underlying funds. There are risks associated with <strong>fixed-income</strong> investments, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and prepayment and extension risk. In general, bond prices rise when interest rates fall and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer term securities. <strong>Foreign</strong> investments subject the fund to risks, including political, economic, market, social and others within a particular country, as well as to currency instabilities and less stringent financial and accounting standards generally applicable to U.S. issuers. Investing in <strong>derivatives</strong> is a specialized activity that involves special risks that subject the fund to significant loss potential, including when used as leverage, and may result in greater fluctuation in fund value. <strong>Asset allocation</strong> does not assure a profit or protect against loss.</p> <p><strong>Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a mutual fund carefully before investing.

Butterfield &amp; Son Limited (</span></span><span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NTB\" title=\"The Bank of N.T. Butterfield &amp; Son Limited\">NTB</a></span><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">). Now I am usually not really a bank guy, but when I heard of their special geographic focus, I had to take a deeper look. Based in Bermuda with significant operations in the Cayman Islands and the Channel Islands, Butterfield caters to high-net-worth individuals, trusts and corporate clients. This unique spot in the banking landscape has allowed them to weather the storms in regional banking much better, not needing to compete aggressively for deposits.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>The stock has performed exceptionally over the last year, rallying 50% from its 52-week lows around the $35 mark, as well as recovering much faster from the 2023 lows most banks faced due to the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. I think the stock still has room to run, with most investors not yet fully understanding their offshore moat, which allows them to have a really sticky deposit base. Add on top of that a strong history of returning capital to shareholders, and you have got yourself one of the best deals in banking I could find.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Offshore Moat and Core Business Model</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>To understand Butterfield's appeal, I want to emphasize its incredibly unique structural advantage. Unlike mainland US regional banks, where the barriers to entry are low and larger national banks are mopping up more and more business as the yield-seeking retail deposit base moves quickly from bank to bank to get the best deal, Butterfield essentially operates as an oligopoly in its island jurisdictions. Bermuda and the Cayman Islands have highly concentrated banking sectors with very few players, and Butterfield acts as the no-brainer choice for most residents, local businesses as well as international trusts. For example, </span><a href=\"https://thebanks.eu/banks-by-country/Bermuda\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener noopener\">thebanks.eu</a><span> currently lists five banks operating in Bermuda, licensed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, of which the second-largest, HSBC Bermuda, has an asset base only about half the size of Butterfield's. So plain and simple, there's just no one else to go to if you're looking for a mortgage or a deposit account, so Butterfield can charge a premium. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>This dynamic creates a much more sticky and low-cost deposit base compared to most banks you will be familiar with in the US. Customers keep their funds at Butterfield not necessarily for the yield, but for the transactional utility and specialized trust services the bank provides. This structural advantage has enabled Butterfield to earn an ROE most other banks would be salivating at the sight of. Take a look at a quick comparison to US regional and national banking peers over the last 10 years: </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_4ec2324cc56434d14fb7a549473cb53a.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_4ec2324cc56434d14fb7a549473cb53a.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_4ec2324cc56434d14fb7a549473cb53a.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_4ec2324cc56434d14fb7a549473cb53a.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FY 2025 and Q4 Earnings Review: Strong Execution Across the Board </h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Butterfield's <a href=\"https://www.butterfieldgroup.com/sites/butterfield-corp/files/butterfield/investor-relations/financial-reports/annual/annual-report-2025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">most recent report</a> shows them once again humming along and bringing good results as they utilize their special spot in the banking world. The bank posted quarterly earnings of $1.54 per diluted share, beating the consensus estimate of $1.47 by about 5%. Total revenue for the quarter came in at $158.9 million, topping estimates of $153 million and representing solid year-over-year growth. Now, while the growth is nothing to scoff at, it's not really what excites me the most. Several other factors stood out to me:</span> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Net Interest Margin (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NIM\" title=\"Nuveen Select Maturities Municipal Fund\">NIM</a>) Expansion:<strong> </strong></span><span>While many banks saw their margins squeezed in 2025, Butterfield’s NIM actually increased by 5 basis points to 2.69% for the full year. On top of that, the average cost of deposits fell to 1.5%, with management again underscoring my point of the unique customer base and business model driving this dynamic</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Surging Non-Interest Income:<strong> </strong><span>The bank generated $66.3 million in non-interest income in Q4, an increase of $5.1 million from the previous quarter. While part of this was driven by seasonal card volumes, the higher foreign exchange fees and trust income will be something to look out for in the next quarters. The trust segment includes contributions from the integration of the acquired Credit Suisse book, so that seems to be going well for the company. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Exceptional Return on Equity: <span>As already mentioned, Butterfield's impressive ROE track record continued into the fourth quarter with an ROE of 21.7% and a core Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (ROATCE) of 24.2%. In the banking sector, an ROATCE above 15% is generally considered excellent; with Butterfield operating above 20% and even near 25%, places it in the top tier of financial institutions. If this metric doesn't get you interested, or even better, a bit suspicious, then I don't know what will.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h3> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Asset Quality and Balance Sheet Health</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Let's take a closer look at Butterfield’s books; I want to get the confidence that their high ROE is not just built on excessive risk-taking. But luckily, from what I was able to glean from a look into their balance sheet, Butterfield has backed up its high ROE with prudent risk management, once again on display in their Q4 report. </span> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Credit performance remained quite stable in the quarter, with the bank reporting <a href=\"https://www.butterfieldgroup.com/sites/butterfield-corp/files/2026-02/NTB-4Q25-and-Full-Year-Earnings-Presentation-February-10-2026.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">zero net charge-offs</a>, bringing the full-year net charge-off ratio for 2025 to a negligible 0.01%. Non-accrual loans are holding steady at roughly 2%, and the allowance for credit losses (ACL) remains at an adequate 0.6%. </span> </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772016254690327_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"782\" data-height=\"426\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772016254690327_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Butterfield's Portfolio Distribution\" width=\"640\" height=\"349\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772016254690327_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772016254690327_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772016254690327_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772016254690327_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Butterfield's Portfolio Distribution <span>(Butterfield Group Investor Relations)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>I’d also like to highlight Butterfield’s loan distribution</span>. 71% of its loan portfolio consists of full-recourse residential mortgages. Additionally, 79% of these loans have loans-to-value ratios (LTVs) below 70%, giving them ample room to withstand any real estate shocks. This means even in a scenario where island real estate prices drop by 20% to 30%, Butterfield has a meaningful equity buffer before principal impairment becomes likely. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of this, Butterfield maintains a much more conservative balance sheet, compared to its US peers, as well as to the benchmarks set out by regulators, as measured by its regulatory capital to total capital ratio. This measure signals that Butterfield has a very large cushion against losses set up. On the other hand, tangible common equity (TCE) is a bit lower than the US median, with 7.5% TCE and 8.6% excluding cash, meaning they are more leveraged than peers, so any losses that do pile up eat into equity faster. However, looking at some larger US regional banking peers, Butterfield's TCE is very much in its expected range, with Regions Financial's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RF\" title=\"Regions Financial Corporation\">RF</a>) 7.76%, Citizens Financial's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CFG\" title=\"Citizens Financial Group, Inc.\">CFG</a>) 7.5% and KeyCorp's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KEY\" title=\"KeyCorp\">KEY</a>) slightly higher 8.36%, as well as above their own target range of 6.0% to 6.5%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720172859122522_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1227\" data-height=\"408\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720172859122522_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Butterfield Balance Sheet Risk Measures 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"213\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720172859122522_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720172859122522_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720172859122522_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720172859122522_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Butterfield Group Investor Relations</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h3> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Capital Returns: A Shareholder Yield Machine</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another major positive for me is management's relentless commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Because Butterfield requires very little capital to fund its growth and ongoing business, management chooses to reward shareholders and directs nearly all of it back to investors. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Share Repurchases: In 2025, the bank bought back 3.5 million shares at a total cost of $146.7 million. Because the stock has historically traded at a low multiple, these buybacks have been highly accretive to tangible book value, which grew by 21.7% in 2025 to end the year at $26.41 per share. Looking ahead, the Board has recently authorized a new 3.0 million share repurchase program (worth roughly $150 million) effective through December 2026. If all of the 3 million shares are repurchased, this would represent about 7% of Butterfield's shares outstanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dividends: The bank recently declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share. At current prices, this translates to a reliable forward dividend yield of roughly 3.9%. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When you add those two sources of capital returns together, Butterfield boasts a total payout ratio of about 100% of its earnings. This creates a massive yield for long-term holders of the stock, and establishes a solid floor under the share price. Importantly, buybacks are discretionary, giving management flexibility if conditions tighten. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772019557999942.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Butterfield Payout Ratio\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"622\" height=\"367\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772019557999942.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772019557999942.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-1772019557999942.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Butterfield Group Investor Relations</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation: Still Room to Run</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Despite the stock's recent performance, I think Butterfield is far from overvalued. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Currently trading at around $51, the stock is valued at a trailing P/E of 9.32x and a forward P/E of 8.61x. This is quite a bit lower than the broader sector median of almost 13x, as calculated by Seeking Alpha’s Quant dashboard. Given Butterfield’s much superior ROE of 21.49%, low credit risk, and strong history of shareholder capital returns, I, personally, would argue that Butterfield should even deserve a premium multiple, rather than the current discount. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720477625943882.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha Quant Valuation Rating\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"578\" height=\"846\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720477625943882.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720477625943882.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/57932842-17720477625943882.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha Quant Rating</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>If the market were to re-rate Butterfield to even just a modest trailing P/E multiple of 12, still below the sector median and far away from the premium I would be happy to pay, we would expect a return of almost 30%, even before accounting for dividends. The market’s hesitance likely stems from a lack of familiarity with the offshore banking jurisdiction that is at the source of the structural pricing advantage. Even if investors continue to not pay attention to the Butterfield’s fundamentals, the strong buyback initiative active at the moment gives me confidence that sooner or later, the market will be able to price their unique situation. Until that takes place, we can enjoy the good dividend policy. </span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I can see a couple of headwinds that could impact my investment thesis:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Geographic Concentration: <span>Butterfield’s business is inherently tied to the health and real estate markets of its three major operational jurisdictions. </span><span>A severe hurricane or a local economic downturn could hurt their operations and spike credit costs. Additionally, due to operating in the UK’s Channel Islands, around 25% of their book has exposure to GBP, adding some slight currency risk. </span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regulatory Changes:<span> Being concentrated in offshore tax havens means any sweeping changes in global minimum tax regulations or trust reporting standards could impact the attractiveness of Butterfield's businesses. And just in general, the \"offshore tax haven\" angle of the investment definitely turns off many investors, likely being partially responsible for Butterfield being so overlooked at the moment.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interest Rate Sensitivity:<span> While Butterfield was able to manage their interest rate exposure well over the last interest rate cycle, they do report a larger exposure to a change in rates than their US peers. Specifically, a cut in rates by the Fed or the Bank of England could pressure the yields on their investment portfolio, which is heavily exposed to medium-term US Treasuries and MBS.

It offers investors access to a bank entrenched in a niche market, operating highly profitably, while actively returning capital to investors by shrinking its share count and paying a healthy dividend. The 2025 earnings update as well as the new share buyback program gives me confidence that management is focusing on the right things: expanding margins, keeping a lid on credit costs, and successfully integrating their M&amp;A trust acquisitions. </span></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Trading at under 10x earnings while having an ROE of over 20% just doesn’t make sense, but does offer us a compelling upside and a wide margin of safety. As the market wakes up to the durability of Butterfield's offshore moat, a multiple re-rating feels more and more like an inevitability. While I by no means expect Butterfield to grow by large margins in the coming future, I see them humming along at their currently strong baseline, continuing to give back what they earn to the shareholders, slowly but surely buying up the float, and paying a sizeable dividend. For that reason, I issue a Buy rating. </span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"></h3>",

Everybody wants to own Park Place and Boardwalk, right?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That creates opportunities for other assets that fly under the radar. Think Electric Company and Water Works. These properties are relatively cheap and offer steady but not flashy return potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This brings me to my topic of today, which is American Water Works (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AWK\" title=\"American Water Works Company, Inc.\">AWK</a></span>). In the real world, AWK has spent almost two decades as a publicly traded company proving that water is the ultimate defensive play.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I last covered AWK with a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4857166-great-utility-priced-under-fair-value-american-water-works\">Buy rating in January</a> for Treading Softly, I liked that it wasn't just a utility but a dividend machine. At the time, the company had a 17-year dividend growth streak. I also thought it could achieve its high single-digit percentage annual EPS growth targets. The A S&amp;P credit rating with a stable outlook was another positive. Finally, shares were trading at a double-digit percentage discount to our fair value estimate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nearly two months later, I'm reiterating my Buy rating. AWK's growth outlook appears to be holding up. The company's debt-to-capital ratio is below its target, and it maintains ample liquidity. Sealing the deal on my Buy rating, shares are about as undervalued today as they were in January.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Growth Profile Remains Intact</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-177212255752168_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1281\" data-height=\"720\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-177212255752168_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AWK's adjusted EPS bridge from Q4 2024 to Q4 2025.\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-177212255752168_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-177212255752168_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-177212255752168_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-177212255752168_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>AWK Q4 2025 Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On February 18th, AWK released its earnings report for the fourth quarter ended December 31st, 2025. The company's operating revenue grew by 5.8% year-over-year to $1.27 billion in the quarter. For more color, that missed Seeking Alpha's analyst consensus during the quarter by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553646-american-water-works-non-gaap-eps-of-1_24-misses-by-0_03-revenue-of-1_27b-misses-by-20m\">$20 million</a>. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What was behind AWK's respectable topline growth for the fourth quarter? Once again, the biggest catalyst for AWK's operating revenue growth in the quarter had to do with favorable rate case decisions that have gone into effect in recent months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since January 1st, 2025, the company has been authorized an additional $264 million in annualized revenue from general rate cases. Of that amount, $250 million was effective in 2025, with the remaining $14 million effective in 2026. These were spread across rate cases in Tennessee, Virginia, Missouri, Iowa, Hawaii, and, most recently, Kentucky (last December).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's more, another $85 million of additional annualized revenue from infrastructure surcharges was authorized. Of that amount, $69 million went into effect in 2025, with the remaining $16 million effective in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strategic acquisitions made throughout the year were another growth tailwind. The company closed on 18 acquisitions in 7 states, which added 20,900 customer connections. The final piece of the growth puzzle was incremental organic customer growth throughout its service territories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWK's adjusted EPS jumped 7.8% higher over the year-ago period to $1.24 in the fourth quarter. This came up $0.03 shy of Seeking Alpha's analyst consensus during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721228435074584_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1275\" data-height=\"719\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721228435074584_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AWK's five-year capex plan (without Essential Utilities) for 2026 through 2030.\" width=\"640\" height=\"361\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721228435074584_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721228435074584_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721228435074584_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721228435074584_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>AWK Q4 2025 Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking out over the next few years, the future is encouraging for AWK. Of course, the company's deal to combine with WTRG announced last fall is a reason for optimism. This would unite the two largest water utilities in the country to further enhance AWK's scale. As I noted in January, the company's geographic diversification profile would also improve, with a more pronounced presence in Texas and North Carolina.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another reason to like AWK is its pending acquisitions outside of WTRG. Heading into 2026, the company had $582 million of acquisitions under agreement, representing around 104,000 customer connections, per COO Cheryl Norton's opening remarks during the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872161-american-water-works-company-inc-awk-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 2025 Earnings Call</a>. Longer term, the company has over 1.5 million customer connections in its pipeline that it can selectively acquire in the years ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then, there's the fact that AWK has no shortage of opportunities for investment in its infrastructure in the future. Modernizing and expanding its assets to accommodate growing customer demand is why it expects to invest $19 billion to $20 billion from 2026 through 2030 (not counting WTRG).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consequently, AWK thinks it can drive 8% to 9% annual rate base growth over that time. Put it all together, and I'm confident that the utility can achieve its 7% to 9% annual adjusted EPS growth target over the next several years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This jives with the FAST Graphs analyst consensus as well. Current forecasts anticipate adjusted EPS will compound by 7.7% annually through 2028, off a 2025 base of $5.69.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229000578132_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1283\" data-height=\"719\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229000578132_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A summary of AWK's long-term senior unsecured credit ratings, total debt to capital ratio, consolidated debt maturity profile, and liquidity profile as of December 31st, 2025.\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229000578132_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229000578132_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229000578132_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229000578132_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>AWK Q4 2025 Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financially, AWK is also stable.

All the while, the S&amp;P 500 index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" class=\"ticker-link\">SP500</a>) was relatively flat over that time. Even so, I believe that the water utility's shares are almost as compelling a value now as they were a couple of months ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is because AWK's forward 12-month P/E ratio is 21.7. That's just a bit above the prior value of 21.5. Put into perspective, both of these values are far less than the FAST Graphs' 10-year average P/E ratio of 29.2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, I'm leaving my fair value P/E ratio at 24. This would be nearly two standard deviations below the 10-year average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's my rationale for my fair value multiple? Well, the 7.7% annual adjusted EPS growth consensus (up from a previous value of 6.7%) is essentially the same as the 10-year CAGR of approximately 8%. That drives home my point that AWK's growth prospects remain robust.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, the higher interest rate environment will remain a drag on the water utility's valuation multiple. The current 10-year U.S. Treasury yield (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y\" class=\"ticker-link\">US10Y</a>) of 4% is materially higher than the 10-year average of roughly 2.7%, according to data from <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2016/10-year-treasury-bond-rate-yield-chart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Macrotrends</a>. Overall, I believe that the 10-year yield will generally be in the high-3% to low-4% range for the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the past 10 years, AWK's earnings yield to the 10-year yield investment spread has been 75 basis points or less. Considering that the fundamentals are holding firm, I think this remains a realistic spread. This is how I arrive at my fair value multiple of 24.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of now, the calendar year 2026 is 16% complete. That suggests another 84% of 2026 and 16% of 2027 are yet to come over the next 12 months. This produces a forward 12-month adjusted EPS input of $6.16.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plugging my fair value multiple of 24 into this input, I arrive at a fair value of $148 a share. Compared to the current $134 share price (as of Feb. 26th, 2026), that equates to a 10% discount to fair value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If AWK matches growth forecasts and returns to my fair value estimate, it could deliver a 14% total return by the end of March 2027. Through 2031, the water utility could generate 10%+ annual total returns.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expect Sizable Dividend Growth To Persist</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229735362868_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1520\" data-height=\"196\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229735362868_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AWK in the Zen Research Terminal.\" width=\"640\" height=\"83\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"83\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229735362868_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229735362868_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229735362868_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229735362868_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Dividend Kings' Zen Research Terminal</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWK's 2.5% forward dividend yield remains below the 3.1% median forward yield of the utility sector. That equates to a 40 basis point narrowing of the spread since January. Still, AWK earns a D- grade from <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AWK/dividends/yield\">Seeking Alpha's Quant System</a> for overall dividend yield (unchanged from January).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Putting aside the modest immediate income, the water utility earns exceptionally high marks in every other area. AWK's adjusted EPS payout ratio is likely to be in the high-50% range for 2026. This would be squarely within its targeted range of between 55% and 60%. What's more, AWK's payout ratio is well below the 75% payout ratio that rating agencies have set forth as the industry-safe standard, according to the Zen Research Terminal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, the Zen Research Terminal pegs the probability of a dividend cut in the next 12 months at only 1% for AWK. In the next average recession, this risk rises to 2.5%. As a result, the Quant System issues an A grade for overall dividend safety (the same as it was in January).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That sets AWK up to build on its existing 17-year dividend growth streak to become a Dividend Aristocrat in the first half of the next decade. For more context, this is much more established than the sector median of just 9 years. That's how AWK garners A and A- grades from the Quant System for consecutive years of dividend growth and overall dividend consistency, respectively (the latter of which is up from a B+ grade in January).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Quant System anticipates 7.5% annual forward dividend per share growth from the water utility moving forward. This would be well above the sector median forecast of just 5.4%. That's arguably underestimating AWK's annual dividend growth potential by 25 to 50 basis points, too. This is because the company is in a prime position to deliver dividend growth in line with adjusted EPS growth moving forward (its payout ratio is situated perfectly in the middle of its targeted range). At any rate, the Quant System awards A- and B grades for the forward dividend per share and overall dividend growth metrics (the former of which is down from an A grade in January and the latter of which is up from a B- grade).</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks To Consider</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWK is a fundamentally thriving water utility. However, it still faces risks that could challenge the investment thesis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just as I discussed in January, the most consequential risk to AWK remains the pending merger with WTRG. Now that shareholders of both companies <a href=\"https://ir.amwater.com/news-and-events/financial-releases/financial-release-details/2026/American-Water-and-Essential-Utilities-Shareholders-Approve-Merger-Related-Proposals-at-Special-Shareholder-Meetings/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">overwhelmingly approved the deal</a> earlier this month, the obstacles that must still be navigated to get this deal finalized are federal regulators (the Federal Trade Commission) and state regulators (e.g., Pennsylvania and New Jersey's public utility commissions).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most challenging hurdle to clear remains approvals from state regulators in every state where AWK and/or WTRG have significant operations. Quelling <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/business/american-water-essentials-merger-risk-20251101.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">legal opposition</a> to the deal is likely going to involve some concessions on the part of the companies, such as promising not to raise rates for two or three years and not laying off local workers for a set period. These trade-offs could temporarily hurt the combined company's profit margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the deal is finalized, then there's the potential that AWK can't achieve its anticipated synergies. If that happens, it could be a major blow to the logic for doing the deal in the first place. That could put some downward pressure on AWK's growth story.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk to AWK is that while it's already a high-value target for hackers, a completed merger with WTRG would likely further enhance its appeal. If any major cyber breaches are successful, that could set AWK back with regulatory penalties and lawsuits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One last risk to the water utility is that the environment in which it operates could become unfavorable. What do I mean?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, an <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/pri/topics/livable-communities/utilities/utility-costs-affordability-poll/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AARP survey</a> from last year found that at least three out of four Americans age 50 and older were worried about their utilities going up. Since this demographic tends to be the largest voting bloc, the risk is that such a sentiment could cause regulators to limit the extent of AWK's rate increases. Combined with higher capex, this could weigh on the company's growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a worst-case scenario, adverse rate case outcomes could lead rating agencies to downgrade AWK's credit ratings. That could raise its cost of capital, putting its current capex ambitions at risk.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary: A Boring Way To Collect Double-Digit Total Returns</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On its own, AWK is arguably a best-in-breed water utility. In my view, this would only likely be enhanced if the deal for WTRG is completed. The company's 7% to 9% annual adjusted EPS growth target is the strongest in the industry. Its A-rated balance sheet is also impressive.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares also look moderately undervalued. Overall, the current valuation provides a realistic path to 10%+ annual total returns over the medium term. That's why I'm reiterating my Buy rating.</p>",

The stock has fewer than 10k followers on SA, company information is sparse and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> it is not a business many investors would think of as an investment opportunity. This is part of its beauty.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The business model will never be disrupted, the demand will always be there and it will stand the test of time. Service Corporation is North America’s leading provider of funeral, cremation and cemetery services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To understand what shaped this company, low key profile and conservative business model, we first need to take a look at it from a historical lens. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Historical Viewpoint</h2> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The death scare in 1999</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the late 1990s, the SCI’s founder, <a href=\"https://nmfh.org/robert-waltrip/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Waltrip</a>, pursued a hyper-aggressive growth <a href=\"https://portersfiveforce.com/blogs/brief-history/sci-corp\" rel=\"noopener\">strategy</a>. The company acquired thousands of family operated funeral homes and cemeteries globally to consolidate them under SCI. To fund its expansion, SCI took on large amounts of debt and accepted lower returns on capital, just to sustain its growth momentum. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even in a predictable business like this, <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/usa/united-states/death-rate\" rel=\"nofollow\">mortality rates</a> can and will fluctuate over time. 1999 marked the tipping point for the company where slightly lower mortality rates combined with high leverage created ripple effects. In October that year, the company published a quarterly report that greatly disappointed investors and the stock plummeted over 50%, in one day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This sell-off created a market panic and SCI was no longer able to sell shares to fund acquisitions needed to keep the growth going. With interest payments that needed to be serviced, the company started a fire-sale of its assets and pulled out from the international markets. SCI managed by a thin margin to stabilize and recover over time. SCI stopped trying to take over the world and focused on becoming a lean, North American cash-flow machine. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, the company is managed in a conservative fashion. The mindset was forged during the near death experience and instead of expansion, the company is now prioritizing share buybacks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/8/saupload_f70f6106152371c9b1ef047aef4dcfa0.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/8/saupload_f70f6106152371c9b1ef047aef4dcfa0.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/8/saupload_f70f6106152371c9b1ef047aef4dcfa0.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/8/saupload_f70f6106152371c9b1ef047aef4dcfa0.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 2020 pull-forward of demand</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mortality rates can also fluctuate and surprise on the upside. This is exactly what happened when COVID became a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic\" rel=\"nofollow\">global pandemic</a> in 2020. It was an outlier event that generated a massive profit windfall for SCI. The downside was that the succeeding years had very challenging comparisons and it would take years for the company to exceed the high watermark set in 2021. The dust is now settling and the carry-forward effects of the COVID era are behind them. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/27340043-1770232993841946_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2228\" data-height=\"1268\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/27340043-1770232993841946_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SCI COVID era earnings\" width=\"640\" height=\"364\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/27340043-1770232993841946_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/27340043-1770232993841946_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/27340043-1770232993841946_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/27340043-1770232993841946_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SCI Investor Presentation Q3 2025</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is where we begin our assessment of the company.

We are developing a DCF model to discount future expected cash flow to assess what the company is worth today.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FY25 Performance: Foundation for Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SCI continues to be the undisputed market leader within the fragmented death care industry, holding a revenue market share of about 17%, spanning across Canada and the US. Its competitive advantages being a strong national brand name, operational <a href=\"https://www.sci-corp.com/about\" rel=\"nofollow\">scale</a> and a one-stop shop service provider.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The business model has generated compounded <a href=\"https://filecache.investorroom.com/mr5ir_scicorp/344/Q3%2025%20IR%20Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">earnings</a> of 8%-12% YoY through organic and capital deployment. Organic growth is achieved through volume and pricing. Capital deployment accounts for the remaining part through investment in the business, <a href=\"https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/SCI/cash-flow/repurchase-of-capital-stock#google_vignette\" rel=\"nofollow\">share buybacks</a> and debt management. A hidden growth lever for this company is also float built up by preened payments, effectively working as an interest-free loan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2025 marks the year where we are seeing a clear turning point in its <a href=\"https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=101533&amp;ref=319775250&amp;type=HTML&amp;symbol=SCI&amp;cdn=b0ec71006c3e36a82715b83b82f72e45&amp;companyName=Service+Corporation+International&amp;formType=10-K&amp;dateFiled=2026-02-12\" rel=\"nofollow\">results</a>.

Our conservative scenario indicates an upside of 6.42% and the base scenario a 24.38% upside from current level, excluding dividends. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Factors that support an even higher stock price valuation could be stronger revenue growth over the plan period and/or a lower WACC assumed in the optimistic scenario.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Factors that support a more conservative scenario include a slowdown in its Service Revenue, driven by the ongoing secular shift towards cremation. <a href=\"https://nfda.org/news/media-center/nfda-news-releases/id/9786/nfda-releases-2025-cremation-burial-report-comprehensive-insights-to-guide-the-future-of-funeral-service\" rel=\"nofollow\">NFDA</a> estimate that the cremation rate will reach 63.4% in 2025, more than double that of burial rate of 31.6%. This trend is expected to continue. By 2045, cremations are expected to rise to 82% of dispositions. Cremation pressures the profitability for SCI, as urns are lower margins than high value merchandise like caskets. SCI has thus far been able to offset this through price increases in its traditional services, but its pricing power is not unlimited.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk factor is SCI's high <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-SCI/financials-statistics-and-ratios/debt-to-equity/\" rel=\"nofollow\">debt-to-equity ratio </a>to fund its large share buyback programs. If interest rates rise or if the company receives a credit rating downgrade, the resulting high interest expense would eat into the dividend payments and free cash flow. In addition to this, higher rates would increase the WACC and necessitate a lower valuation reflected in the conservative case. </p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, considering the predictability of the business, conservative operations, interest rates going down and strong implied upside in our DCF model for all scenarios, we recommend to buy the stock, currently trading at $79.20. </p>",

While we continue<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to believe in the risks associated to the debasement trade, longer dated rates have come down considerably and we think it's on the following factors that have driven the recovery in long duration fixed income bets:</span></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>YTM declines driven by a weaker, more immediate outlook about the economy</li> <li>The Supreme Court decision that in principle should require Trump to find another basis for his executive tariffs - disinflationary from productivity expansion</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We aren't particularly positive on the economy. As far as the tariffs are concerned, we imagine that they will come back in some way, just has to be on a different legal basis and may not even need to go through Congress after all. For now the President is using the <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2026/obstacles-facing-trumps-next-attempt-imposing-tariffs\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2026/obstacles-facing-trumps-next-attempt-imposing-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\">BoP authority</a> which is temporary (150 days) before a more solid foundation will be needed for the tariffs which we think he will likely find, though there is the upside if he doesn't. While a weak economic outlook could support duration bets, we continue to maintain the concerns around the debasement trade such that bets like these are excessively risky for the limited fixed income rewards that Treasuries provide.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_33336eefd76fda113243cdbb3025376e.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_33336eefd76fda113243cdbb3025376e.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_33336eefd76fda113243cdbb3025376e.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_33336eefd76fda113243cdbb3025376e.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SCHQ Breakdown</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The portfolio's effective duration is <a href=\"https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schq\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schq\" target=\"_blank\">13.8 years,</a> which is quite a lot of duration. 22 years is the effective average maturity. <a href=\"https://www.worldgovernmentbonds.com/country/united-states/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.worldgovernmentbonds.com/country/united-states/\" target=\"_blank\">Compared to 12 months ago</a>, YTMs at the 20 year range are the same as today but they've come down considerably from the 6 and 3 month mark which is the period in which the debasement trade started to take effect. As a recap, the debasement trade is the idea that geopolitics and Trump has affected the attractiveness of the USD as a reserve currency, thereby threatening government capital access in the US and raising longer term rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The decision of the Supreme Court that the emergency powers of the President don't cover tariff policy has led to the current tariffs being called illegal. While there is time to find a new legal authority to found the tariffs on, should the tariffs disappear a major geopolitical hiccup and inflationary force would be unwound, hence the reduction of shorter and also longer term rates as the productivity benefits from lower tariffs with a key player like the US would accrue in the long-term as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To elaborate on the other reason why the rates are coming down, there are some worries about the economy. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/us-companies-announce-most-job-cuts-for-any-january-since-2009?cmpid=eveus\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/us-companies-announce-most-job-cuts-for-any-january-since-2009?cmpid=eveus\" target=\"_blank\">US job cuts</a> were surging a bit in January. <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/employment-rate\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/employment-rate\" target=\"_blank\">Employment rates</a> have been going down. <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/labor-force-participation-rate\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/labor-force-participation-rate\" target=\"_blank\">Participation rates</a> have also been a bit lower YoY. The main thinking is that this has been on the back of AI. There could be a demand side issue if it translates into a more pervasive white collar anxiety about AI taking jobs. All of this pushes down on rates as it becomes an apparent possibility than unencumbered by inflation, the Fed may lean into attacking the growth mandate. Theoretically, the AI development itself could be disinflationary if it does enough for productivity. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-30/warsh-set-to-face-early-reality-check-as-trump-s-man-at-the-fed\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-30/warsh-set-to-face-early-reality-check-as-trump-s-man-at-the-fed\" target=\"_blank\">This is what the incoming Fed chair, Warsh, is hoping for</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The assumptions behind the USD reserve currency status determine so much of the dollar's value and of the capital access of the US to keep refinancing its balance sheet. We'd rather not take these FI bets that could be tanked on these major revisions in assumptions, though we do think the risks are remote and that the checks and balances in the US proving themselves should be enough to start restoring the slightly wobbly USD trust. Other than that, if we see a <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-confidence\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-confidence\" target=\"_blank\">clearer decline in consumer sentiment surveys</a>, that could be a sign that the second order anxiety driven effects of the AI threat to employment may start adding more pressure on general economic outlook which would be good for sensitive bets to YTM on the downside. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court ruling may not be a durable help to duration bets assuming a new legal foundation is found for the tariffs, though maybe SCHQ holders will be lucky and the tariffs will actually go away unless congress enacts them. But a new foundation for the tariffs would be the most imminent negative news for duration long exposures. So we still have too few reasons to stop worrying about flare ups in the debasement trade, particularly if the next phase of tariffs includes tactics for government overreach.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But in terms of expense ratios, SCHQ is a better instrument than iShares alternative (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TLT\" title=\"iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF\">TLT</a>) with similar durations but a <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239454/ishares-20-year-treasury-bond-etf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239454/ishares-20-year-treasury-bond-etf\" target=\"_blank\">0.15%</a> expense ratio against a <a href=\"https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schq\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schq\" target=\"_blank\">0.03%</a>.</p>",

It is one of <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/healthcare/genomics-stocks/gene-editing-stocks/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">several</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> gene-editing biotech companies developing novel treatments to cure genetic diseases. Its key focus is a form of gene therapy called base editing, which is proprietary for Beam, using an enzyme to convert DNA bases, for example from C to T or A to G. It is said to offer more consistent gene sequencing outcomes and less genotoxicity than the Crispr Cas-9 technology, which has become better known over the last few years. Beam is the undisputed leader in this particular type of gene editing, which holds great potential.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-1772175845024193_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1398\" data-height=\"650\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-1772175845024193_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Graphic showing technology\" width=\"640\" height=\"298\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-1772175845024193_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-1772175845024193_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-1772175845024193_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-1772175845024193_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Beam Therapeutics</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From initially casting its net quite wide across a handful of different conditions, in 2023 it decided to <a href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/beam-lays-about-100-employees-and-deprioritizes-car-t-programs-push-runway-2026\" rel=\"nofollow\">prioritize its financial and human resources</a> on the pathways most likely to achieve success, principally to extend its cash runway.

Bluebird Bio also saw is <a href=\"https://www.lyfgenia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lyfgenia</a> SCD treatment approved by the FDA, before struggles with take-up led it to seek a <a href=\"https://www.biospace.com/deals/bluebird-facing-cash-crunch-to-go-private-in-deal-valued-at-30m\" rel=\"nofollow\">private buy-out</a> and <a href=\"https://www.biospace.com/business/bye-bye-bluebird-gene-therapy-biotech-emerges-from-private-buyout-with-rebrand\" rel=\"nofollow\">corporate rebrand</a> last year. The one-time curative treatments that Casgevy and Lyfgenia offer are what Beam is up against with its risto-cel treatment; this is the bar that has been set.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Vertex/Crispr and the renamed Genetix Biotherapeutics have a several-year head start on Beam, it is possible that Beam’s treatment could become the industry standard in time, but this is by no means guaranteed. Their management argues that their specific gene editing technique is better than Crispr Cas-9, which involves the use of an enzyme to make double-stranded breaks/cuts in DNA and repair them. This technique is argued to create cells with varying levels of effectiveness (they are inconsistent) and the process could, theoretically, cause mutations and off-target effects through the harmful rearrangement of chromosomes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It must be said, though, that the latter outcome was not seen in any of their clinical trials. What base editing does, by contrast, is to limit this variability in cells – and therefore mitigate the risks involved – by eliminating double-stranded breaks entirely. While Crispr Cas-9 is used, conceptually, like a pair of scissors, <a href=\"https://beamtx.com/science/base-editing-applications/\" rel=\"nofollow\">base editing is like a pencil that can erase and rewrite</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In November 2024, <a href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/beam-hits-hemoglobin-goal-first-base-editing-clinical-data-reports-death-tied-conditioning\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beam announced results</a> from its first trial (BEACON phase 1/2), which offered data on just 4 patients. The data was very promising, as the treatment brought HbF levels up above 70%, which was above its target of &gt;60%. At this level, in a clinical setting, we’re talking nearly “normal,” essentially asymptomatic with no VOCs occurring. This is obviously a slight but meaningful improvement on what Casgevy offers. More recently, in December 2025, <a href=\"https://investors.beamtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beam-therapeutics-reports-updated-data-beacon-phase-12-trial\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beam provided updated figures from its cohort of 29 patients</a> in the phase 1/2 trial. Patients maintained mean HbF levels above 60%, with a mean reduction in corresponding HbS levels below 40%. Researcher Dr. Ashish Gupta also remarked on its comparatively quicker engraftment and fewer hospitalizations:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>Given the cumbersome nature of the transplant process, it is encouraging that patients receiving risto-cel are on average experiencing a low number of cell collection cycles, rapid neutrophil and platelet engraftment, and low neutropenic days post-risto-cel treatment. Each of these factors contributes to fewer days in the hospital, potentially improving the overall patient experience.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450915744_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1325\" data-height=\"607\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450915744_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Graphic showing drug potential\" width=\"640\" height=\"293\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450915744_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450915744_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450915744_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450915744_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Beam Therapeutics</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One patient unfortunately died during the phase 1/2 trial, very early on (one of the first 4 to be studied). The researcher concluded that this was unrelated to risto-cel specifically, but instead to do with the preliminary myeloablative conditioning protocol, which requires <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/busulfan-intravenous-route/description/drg-20067303\" rel=\"nofollow\">Busulfan</a> (a chemotherapy drug that rids the body of its bone marrow). It nevertheless highlights the problem for risto-cel at this point. For it to truly challenge Casgevy (and to a lesser extent Lyfgenia) – especially considering that Vertex is so much better funded as a company and so brings with it numerous advantages in manufacturing, distribution, and marketing – risto-cel must offer real, tangible, clinical benefits for patients. Early data suggests slightly superior efficacy as I noted above, but the real benefit will be if the conditioning protocol can lessen the patient burden. Indeed, a recent report suggested that the slow take-up of both Casgevy and Lyfgenia two years post-approval has mostly been related to <a href=\"https://www.biospace.com/drug-development/sickle-cell-gene-therapies-casgevy-and-lyfgenia-still-lacking-traction-2-years-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">negative sentiment</a> surrounding the conditioning protocol. No doubt risto-cel will experience the same slow take-up unless they can overcome this challenge.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Challenges of Pre-Treatment Conditioning</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like Casgevy and Lyfgenia, at present risto-cel requires myeloablative conditioning (Busulfan), which brings a host of nasty possible side-effects, including infertility, veno-occlusive liver disease, nausea, vomiting, mouth sores, and low blood cell counts (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia). The most troubling of these is infertility, especially for young people, and while Vertex offer “fertility preservation services” for patients insured commercially, this does not cover those under the Medicaid program. In mid-2024, <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/vertex-sue-hhs-casgevy-sickle-cell-fertility-treatment-aks/721417/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vertex sued the U.S. government</a> for blocking their offer of financial support (up to $70,000 per patient), but in 2025 a U.S. court <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/dc-court-backs-hhs-denying-vertexs-proposed-fertility-support-coverage-program-casgevy\" rel=\"nofollow\">rejected the suit</a>. This continues to represent a challenge for Vertex in terms of the broad take-up of Casgevy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Returning to risto-cel, while the patient experience might be slightly better than Casgevy at this point, I believe that the true promise of risto-cel is predicated upon the results stemming from follow-up trials BEAM-103 and BEAM-104 (part of the ESCAPE program). Both of these are anti-CD117 monoclonal antibodies that are intended to either suppress or eliminate HSPCs. BEAM-104 has shown <a href=\"https://trial.medpath.com/news/61acb29213ef1585/sickle-cell-patient-dies-in-beam-study-of-base-editing-therapy-biopharma-dive\" rel=\"nofollow\">promising preclinical data</a> (in animal studies), while Beam-103 is advancing human trials presently. In simple terms, what they offer is the potential to use risto-cel in a different way. It offers a non-genotoxic, non-chemotherapeutic alternative to traditional myeloablative conditioning for the blood stem cell transplants required in patient conditioning. The advancement of this treatment to replace toxic chemotherapy in patients preparing to undergo risto-cel treatment would be a real “game changer” that would position it as superior to Casgevy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, investors here need to understand that Vertex/Crispr are not sitting on their hands with Casgevy, but are also responding to the challenge of Casgevy’s unattractive conditioning protocol. In response, <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/vertex-orum-conditioning-gene-editing-dacs/721473/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vertex partnered with Orum Therapeutics</a> who is developing degrader-antibody conjugates, or DACs, for gene editing preconditioning. It offers a “safer and gentler” conditioning regimen for patients, which Vertex can use to entice more SCD patients to undergo its Casgevy treatment. Also, its commercial partner <a href=\"https://ir.crisprtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crispr-therapeutics-provides-business-update-and-reports-13/#:~:text=CRISPR%20Therapeutics%20continues%20to%20advance,without%20the%20need%20for%20conditioning.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crispr Therapeutics is developing an anti-CD117 antibody-drug conjugate</a> of its own, which is intended to eliminate HSPCs through a non-genotoxic and non-chemotherapeutic agent, in addition to developing an in-vivo application which removes the need for conditioning altogether. The latter, however, remains in preclinical stage, so is perhaps slightly behind Beam in this regard. I believe these advances should have a material impact on Casgevy sales within the next few years, in my estimation, as patients and physicians learn of these improvements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For risto-cel, <a href=\"https://investors.beamtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beam-therapeutics-sets-strategic-priorities-its-genetic-disease/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beam recently announced</a> that they are \"now prioritizing <em>in vivo </em>delivery for its next wave approach in SCD, complementing risto-cel as a potential best-in-class <em>ex vivo</em> therapy.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450096262_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1430\" data-height=\"637\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450096262_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Graphic showing drug potential\" width=\"640\" height=\"285\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450096262_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450096262_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450096262_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450096262_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Beam Therapeutics</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For its current ex-vivo treatment, the company plans to submit a BLA (Biologics License Application) to the FDA before the end of 2026. If fast-tracked or given priority attention by the FDA, approval for risto-cel could arrive in mid/late 2027, with commercialization likely in 2028. All of this assumes further positive data and no delays. As such, while their drug might hold grater promise as a treatment for SCD in the long run, Beam are entering this race a significant distance behind Vertex/Crispr, and this could have a negative impact on much-needed revenue generating opportunities post-approval. However, if they can survive this period without significant shareholder dilution through debt financing and bring their better product to the forefront of patient and physician attention, I see significant upside ahead. Again, however, this is by no means guaranteed and investors may wish to watch from the sidelines for the next year or so to determine their cash spend and research trial progress before investing. There are too many unknowns at this point, and an investment here – based on risto-cel at least – would be speculative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s turn to their other program now, which could have a material impact on their revenue growth over the course of the next few years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Liver-Targeted Program</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this program, Beam are targeting Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) with their BEAM-302 trial, their most advanced in this space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758452313657_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1445\" data-height=\"304\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758452313657_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Graphic of drug pipeline\" width=\"640\" height=\"135\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758452313657_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758452313657_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758452313657_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758452313657_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Beam Therapeutics</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Severe AATD (with the most common homozygous PiZ genotype) impacts more than 100,000 people in the U.S., and there are limited treatment options available. AATD is a <a href=\"https://www.sanofi.com/en/magazine/your-health/cause-copd-alpha-one-antitrypsin-deficiency\" rel=\"nofollow\">genetic disease that can lead to premature emphysema and COPD</a>. For patients, the liver does not produce enough AAT protein, which then causes lung damage. For the lungs, the only treatment is IV augmentation therapy given weekly, but this is by no means curative; it merely <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680306/\" rel=\"nofollow\">slows the progression of lung tissue loss</a>. AATD can also cause cirrhosis in the liver, but there are no approved treatments for this. In both cases – for lung and liver – patients often end up on the transplant list.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The promise of BEAM-302 is to cure the disease by correcting the faulty gene that causes AATD at its root and thereby restore the proper functioning of the liver and AAT protein production.

It did show a high level of patient tolerability, with all reported adverse events being \"mild to moderate,\" such as \"Grade 1 asymptomatic elevations in liver enzymes (ALT and AST) and transient Grade 1 infusion-related reactions,\" none of which required special treatment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, the company has extended the trial – assessing different dosing levels – and, in a progress update, <a href=\"https://investors.beamtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beam-therapeutics-sets-strategic-priorities-its-genetic-disease/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported in January</a> that more than 25 AATD patients have been treated. Beam plans to enroll approximately 50 additional patients to support a future BLA submission to the FDA, and they recently secured a potential accelerated approval pathway. The company plans to update investors on their progress and release updated data from the Phase 1/2 trial by the end of Q1 2026, a few weeks away.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BEAM-301, which is slightly behind 302 in terms of testing and approval progress, offers another indication for Beam’s base editing biotechnology platform. It aims to correct the R83C mutation in patients with glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa), which is a condition that impacts a patient’s ability to convert glycogen back to glucose to sustain blood sugar. Patients are at constant risk of hypoglycemia, which can lead to seizures, coma, or even death, and the current standard of care is 2-4 hourly doses of cornstarch, even overnight. Bringing enzymatic activity up above 11% is considered the threshold for restoring normal activity, which is sufficient to correct metabolic abnormalities and normalize blood sugar in the R83C mutations. Beam’s preclinical study (on animals) showed ~60% base-editing efficiency to correct the R83C mutation, which shows its very strong efficacy. This is very promising, and Beam is currently running a Phase 1/2 trial, with dosing in one of the two cohorts now complete and data expected before the end of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758456940405_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"891\" data-height=\"521\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758456940405_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Graphic of trial plans\" width=\"640\" height=\"374\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758456940405_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758456940405_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758456940405_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758456940405_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Beam Therapeutics</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, on Tuesday, the <a href=\"https://investors.beamtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beam-therapeutics-reports-fourth-quarter-and-year-end-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">company announced its third clinical program</a> (BEAM-304) in its liver-targeted genetic disease, for the disease <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/phenylketonuria/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phenylketonuria</a> (PKU). PKU affects approximately 1 in every 25,000 people in the U.S. (potentially 20,000 people in the U.S.), and increases the amount of phenylalanine in the blood. This is an amino acid (protein building block) that is also found in certain foods, like meat, eggs, and dairy, but also aspartame. Too much Phenylalanine can cause intellectual disability among other serious health problems, so “treatments” for the disease involve heavy dietary restrictions. There is no known cure, which presents an excellent opportunity for Beam or another biotech company to develop one. <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4728993/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gene therapy</a> is considered in the scientific community to offer the best opportunity for a curative treatment, and this is what Beam is targeting.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Beam’s Potential Moat</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I view Beam’s liver-targeted program to be their greatest potential revenue-generating asset, given the competition in this space is less intense than in the metabolic program (risto-cel, for SCD and beta-thalassemia). I share management’s enthusiasm for developing curative treatments across their two pipelines as a potential bonanza for the company and its shareholders, but it could take several years for this to come to fruition with meaningful revenue. Beam’s CEO John Evans <a href=\"https://www.stocktitan.net/news/BEAM/beam-therapeutics-reports-fourth-quarter-and-year-end-2025-financial-tzz64aid0dn4.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">remarked on the PKU expansion news</a> that it \"exemplifies the power and scalability of our platform,\" which could, theoretically, target a whole host of different conditions through its proprietary technology, including blood disorders, liver and metabolic diseases, pulmonary and gastro-intestinal diseases, ophthalmology, oncology and CNS and neuromuscular diseases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Authors of an exploratory study in the <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7503568/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>International Journal of Molecular Science</em> in 2020</a> concluded:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>`DNA base-editing and prime-editing has remarkable potential as a therapeutic tool to correct disease-causing mutations in the human genome. Over 25% of human pathogenic SNPs can be corrected by targeting the four transition mutations, and in principle prime-editing could correct up to 89% of known genetic variants associated with human disease.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An SNP – a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism – is a specific type of genetic variation whereby a single nucleotide (reflected by A, T, C, or G in the DNA sequence) has been replaced by another, which directly causes a disease or disorder. These are very common occurrences, in about 1% of the population. As such, it seems that the potential for Beam in this space – being the only major player – is enormous, if they can get it right (showing high efficacy and safety). They are leading the way and will very likely be first to market here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I perceive the main risk to be its balance sheet and its likely long, winding and uncertain pathway toward profitability. I would posit that once they receive FDA approval for BEAM-302 – which could take another 18-24 months if all goes according to plan – they will have built a moat around their business, which can be used to expand their pipeline into several different disease areas, especially those considered “orphan”—that is: diseases previously ignored by big pharma. It is likely that they will need both risto-cel and Beam-302 approvals in order to survive, but I have confidence given the strong efficacy and safety profiles already demonstrated in clinical trials of each. It will just take time, and the company will need to fund its operations (almost) entirely from its balance sheet to sustain themselves.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Financial Considerations</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beam reported a modest amount of revenue in 2025, mainly from collaboration/licensing deals, but this injection of cash flow is inconsistent quarter over quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758447015316_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"735\" data-height=\"399\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758447015316_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Revenue chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"347\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758447015316_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758447015316_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758447015316_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758447015316_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>StockAnalysis</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is unlikely to generate any revenue from product sales for another two years, so investors have a tough time of properly valuing this company. The only real decent valuation measure of a pre-revenue company like this is its TAM, which is of course highly subjective. I would nevertheless consider it quite large given the different diseases they could target with base editing, and the pricing power that having the only curative treatment for these diseases could bring. However, investors also have to factor in balance sheet risks, principally dilution caused by debt-financing. Shareholders would have celebrated <a href=\"https://investors.beamtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beam-therapeutics-announces-500-million-strategic-financing\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent news of Sixth Street financing</a> to the tune of $500 million, which pushes out its cash runway to 2029, and will help facilitate the commercialization of risto-cel. The terms of the deal</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>includes $100 million funded at close; up to $300 million available upon the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones for risto-cel; and an additional $100 million available at Beam’s option, subject to mutual agreement between the parties, during the seven-year term of the agreement.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beam also <a href=\"https://investors.beamtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beam-therapeutics-reports-fourth-quarter-and-year-end-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">secured a recent deal</a> with Pfizer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>), extending their four-year collaboration focused on <em>in vivo </em>base editing programs. The arrangement offers Pfizer \"an exclusive, worldwide license for a liver-targeted development candidate,\" which will employ Beam’s \"proprietary liver-targeting LNP to deliver base editing reagents.\" Pfizer will be responsible for developing the drug, securing regulatory approvals, manufacturing, and commercialization, and in return Beam will receive milestone payments alongside the future right to opt in – following the completion of the Phase 1/2 trials – to pay an option exercise fee that secures a global co-development and co-commercialization agreement. This would allow it to share, at a 35/65 split, the new profits from the treatment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I view this collaboration with a world-leading biopharmaceutical company as a major win for Beam, reminiscent of <a href=\"https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-and-crispr-therapeutics-establish-collaboration-use\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crispr’s collaboration with Vertex</a> from 2015, which is still going strong over a decade later. Not only providing financial support and leadership/mentorship, the agreement also validates Beam’s proprietary technology and clinical approach.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Presently, Beam have cash and short-term investments of $1.245 billion but burned through $360 million in the previous 12 months ($87 million in Q4 2025 alone). The company has managed to grow its cash pile 46.4% over the past year, from $850 million at the end of 2024. They have total debt of $154 million, which gives them a net cash position of $1.09 billion, representing $10.4 per share. With a market cap of $2.87 billion, investors buying now will receive – subtracting their (net) cash pile – the company’s assets (including property, plant and equipment valued at $205 million) for $1.78 billion, or roughly $18.50 per share. This includes their IP, brand, partnerships &amp; collaborations, and other intangible assets. At a price/book ratio of 2.32, this does not seem overly demanding, and I note that this value has remained between 2.2 and 2.8 for the past 3 years.

However, news related to delays, regulatory missteps, unexpectedly poor clinical data read-outs, expanding overhead costs, or collaborative failures could force the company to seek further cash and debt financing. This may come in 2027 as they gear up to FDA submissions, manufacturing ramp and commercialization. All told, while shareholders have suffered somewhat over the previous few years as BEAM shares have underperformed the market, I feel the worst may be behind it as it gears up to, in all likelihood, a swathe of positive news coming in the back half of 2026 and into next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In conclusion, I rate Beam a very promising biotech company, with a technological competitive advantage in its proprietary base-editing IP. Their two-pronged approach theoretically helps to de-risk the investment case, while their collaboration with Pfizer (among other companies I neglected to mention) provides validation of their unique gene editing approach and its potential. The moderate risk of dilution to my mind is more than offset by the progress being made to bring its two leading products (risto-cel and BEAM-302) to market, but investors should have patience as this is a 5-10 year story before the full potential of the company may be apparent.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The BEAM share price will likely continue to fluctuate – and may continue to be range-bound for the time being – so it is possible that a better entry point presents itself in time. This is especially considering how volatile the market is presently. However, I believe on balance that long-term shareholders will be rewarded here. For those will to be patient, I rate shares a <em>Buy</em>.</p>",

Emphasis on protein is a prevalent thread in packaged food industry investor materials and market chatter.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investor Takeaways</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm tempted to rate Hormel at hold in order to avoid the wrath of its most loyal and patient investors. However, given a long and extraordinarily painful history of flat revenues, falling earnings, and negative returns, investors would be most correct to demand real improvements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hormel's annualized 1Q26 earnings at $1.32 fall short of consensus estimated YE26 and even YE24 earnings. Even the top end of the company's forward earnings guidance at $1.46/share falls short of YE24's $1.47 share. So far, earnings appear likely to disappoint.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, I don't expect Hormel to produce returns by chasing the consumer trend around protein alongside its peers. I recommend investors carefully consider selling Hormel at current market prices.</p>",
