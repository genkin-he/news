Everybody wants to own Park Place and Boardwalk, right?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That creates opportunities for other assets that fly under the radar. Think Electric Company and Water Works. These properties are relatively cheap and offer steady but not flashy return potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This brings me to my topic of today, which is American Water Works (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AWK\" title=\"American Water Works Company, Inc.\">AWK</a></span>). In the real world, AWK has spent almost two decades as a publicly traded company proving that water is the ultimate defensive play.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">When I last covered AWK with a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4857166-great-utility-priced-under-fair-value-american-water-works\">Buy rating in January</a> for Treading Softly, I liked that it wasn't just a utility but a dividend machine. At the time, the company had a 17-year dividend growth streak. I also thought it could achieve its high single-digit percentage annual EPS growth targets. The A S&amp;P credit rating with a stable outlook was another positive. Finally, shares were trading at a double-digit percentage discount to our fair value estimate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nearly two months later, I'm reiterating my Buy rating. AWK's growth outlook appears to be holding up. The company's debt-to-capital ratio is below its target, and it maintains ample liquidity. Sealing the deal on my Buy rating, shares are about as undervalued today as they were in January.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Growth Profile Remains Intact</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-177212255752168_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1281\" data-height=\"720\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-177212255752168_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AWK's adjusted EPS bridge from Q4 2024 to Q4 2025.\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-177212255752168_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-177212255752168_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-177212255752168_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-177212255752168_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>AWK Q4 2025 Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On February 18th, AWK released its earnings report for the fourth quarter ended December 31st, 2025. The company's operating revenue grew by 5.8% year-over-year to $1.27 billion in the quarter. For more color, that missed Seeking Alpha's analyst consensus during the quarter by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553646-american-water-works-non-gaap-eps-of-1_24-misses-by-0_03-revenue-of-1_27b-misses-by-20m\">$20 million</a>. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What was behind AWK's respectable topline growth for the fourth quarter? Once again, the biggest catalyst for AWK's operating revenue growth in the quarter had to do with favorable rate case decisions that have gone into effect in recent months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since January 1st, 2025, the company has been authorized an additional $264 million in annualized revenue from general rate cases. Of that amount, $250 million was effective in 2025, with the remaining $14 million effective in 2026. These were spread across rate cases in Tennessee, Virginia, Missouri, Iowa, Hawaii, and, most recently, Kentucky (last December).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's more, another $85 million of additional annualized revenue from infrastructure surcharges was authorized. Of that amount, $69 million went into effect in 2025, with the remaining $16 million effective in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strategic acquisitions made throughout the year were another growth tailwind. The company closed on 18 acquisitions in 7 states, which added 20,900 customer connections. The final piece of the growth puzzle was incremental organic customer growth throughout its service territories.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWK's adjusted EPS jumped 7.8% higher over the year-ago period to $1.24 in the fourth quarter. This came up $0.03 shy of Seeking Alpha's analyst consensus during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721228435074584_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1275\" data-height=\"719\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721228435074584_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AWK's five-year capex plan (without Essential Utilities) for 2026 through 2030.\" width=\"640\" height=\"361\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721228435074584_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721228435074584_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721228435074584_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721228435074584_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>AWK Q4 2025 Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking out over the next few years, the future is encouraging for AWK. Of course, the company's deal to combine with WTRG announced last fall is a reason for optimism. This would unite the two largest water utilities in the country to further enhance AWK's scale. As I noted in January, the company's geographic diversification profile would also improve, with a more pronounced presence in Texas and North Carolina.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another reason to like AWK is its pending acquisitions outside of WTRG. Heading into 2026, the company had $582 million of acquisitions under agreement, representing around 104,000 customer connections, per COO Cheryl Norton's opening remarks during the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4872161-american-water-works-company-inc-awk-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 2025 Earnings Call</a>. Longer term, the company has over 1.5 million customer connections in its pipeline that it can selectively acquire in the years ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then, there's the fact that AWK has no shortage of opportunities for investment in its infrastructure in the future. Modernizing and expanding its assets to accommodate growing customer demand is why it expects to invest $19 billion to $20 billion from 2026 through 2030 (not counting WTRG).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Consequently, AWK thinks it can drive 8% to 9% annual rate base growth over that time. Put it all together, and I'm confident that the utility can achieve its 7% to 9% annual adjusted EPS growth target over the next several years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This jives with the FAST Graphs analyst consensus as well. Current forecasts anticipate adjusted EPS will compound by 7.7% annually through 2028, off a 2025 base of $5.69.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229000578132_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1283\" data-height=\"719\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229000578132_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"A summary of AWK's long-term senior unsecured credit ratings, total debt to capital ratio, consolidated debt maturity profile, and liquidity profile as of December 31st, 2025.\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229000578132_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229000578132_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229000578132_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229000578132_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>AWK Q4 2025 Earnings Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financially, AWK is also stable.

AWK also had nearly $1.2 billion in liquidity at its disposal heading into 2026 against manageable debt maturities for its size. That's why it possesses an A S&amp;P credit rating and a Baa1 (BBB+ equivalent) credit rating from Moody's on stable outlooks, respectively (unless otherwise sourced or hyperlinked, all info in this subheading was according to <a href=\"https://ir.amwater.com/news-and-events/financial-releases/financial-release-details/2026/AMERICAN-WATER-REPORTS-STRONG-2025-RESULTS-AFFIRMS-2026-EPS-GUIDANCE-AND-LONG-TERM-TARGETS/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">AWK's Q4 2025 Earnings Press Release</a> and <a href=\"https://s26.q4cdn.com/750150140/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/2025-Fourth-Quarter-and-Year-End-Earnings-Call-Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">AWK's Q4 2025 Earnings Presentation</a>).</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fair Value Is Approaching $150 A Share</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-1772122958713346_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1658\" data-height=\"822\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-1772122958713346_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AWK in FAST Graphs.\" width=\"640\" height=\"317\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"317\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-1772122958713346_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-1772122958713346_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-1772122958713346_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-1772122958713346_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FAST Graphs, FactSet</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since my previous article in January, AWK has logged a 6% total return. All the while, the S&amp;P 500 index (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" class=\"ticker-link\">SP500</a>) was relatively flat over that time. Even so, I believe that the water utility's shares are almost as compelling a value now as they were a couple of months ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is because AWK's forward 12-month P/E ratio is 21.7. That's just a bit above the prior value of 21.5. Put into perspective, both of these values are far less than the FAST Graphs' 10-year average P/E ratio of 29.2.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, I'm leaving my fair value P/E ratio at 24. This would be nearly two standard deviations below the 10-year average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What's my rationale for my fair value multiple? Well, the 7.7% annual adjusted EPS growth consensus (up from a previous value of 6.7%) is essentially the same as the 10-year CAGR of approximately 8%. That drives home my point that AWK's growth prospects remain robust.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the other hand, the higher interest rate environment will remain a drag on the water utility's valuation multiple. The current 10-year U.S. Treasury yield (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y\" class=\"ticker-link\">US10Y</a>) of 4% is materially higher than the 10-year average of roughly 2.7%, according to data from <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2016/10-year-treasury-bond-rate-yield-chart\" rel=\"nofollow\">Macrotrends</a>. Overall, I believe that the 10-year yield will generally be in the high-3% to low-4% range for the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the past 10 years, AWK's earnings yield to the 10-year yield investment spread has been 75 basis points or less. Considering that the fundamentals are holding firm, I think this remains a realistic spread. This is how I arrive at my fair value multiple of 24.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As of now, the calendar year 2026 is 16% complete. That suggests another 84% of 2026 and 16% of 2027 are yet to come over the next 12 months. This produces a forward 12-month adjusted EPS input of $6.16.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plugging my fair value multiple of 24 into this input, I arrive at a fair value of $148 a share. Compared to the current $134 share price (as of Feb. 26th, 2026), that equates to a 10% discount to fair value.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If AWK matches growth forecasts and returns to my fair value estimate, it could deliver a 14% total return by the end of March 2027. Through 2031, the water utility could generate 10%+ annual total returns.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Expect Sizable Dividend Growth To Persist</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229735362868_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1520\" data-height=\"196\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229735362868_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AWK in the Zen Research Terminal.\" width=\"640\" height=\"83\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"83\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229735362868_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229735362868_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229735362868_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/16583532-17721229735362868_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>The Dividend Kings' Zen Research Terminal</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWK's 2.5% forward dividend yield remains below the 3.1% median forward yield of the utility sector. That equates to a 40 basis point narrowing of the spread since January. Still, AWK earns a D- grade from <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AWK/dividends/yield\">Seeking Alpha's Quant System</a> for overall dividend yield (unchanged from January).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Putting aside the modest immediate income, the water utility earns exceptionally high marks in every other area. AWK's adjusted EPS payout ratio is likely to be in the high-50% range for 2026. This would be squarely within its targeted range of between 55% and 60%. What's more, AWK's payout ratio is well below the 75% payout ratio that rating agencies have set forth as the industry-safe standard, according to the Zen Research Terminal.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, the Zen Research Terminal pegs the probability of a dividend cut in the next 12 months at only 1% for AWK. In the next average recession, this risk rises to 2.5%. As a result, the Quant System issues an A grade for overall dividend safety (the same as it was in January).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That sets AWK up to build on its existing 17-year dividend growth streak to become a Dividend Aristocrat in the first half of the next decade. For more context, this is much more established than the sector median of just 9 years. That's how AWK garners A and A- grades from the Quant System for consecutive years of dividend growth and overall dividend consistency, respectively (the latter of which is up from a B+ grade in January).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Quant System anticipates 7.5% annual forward dividend per share growth from the water utility moving forward. This would be well above the sector median forecast of just 5.4%. That's arguably underestimating AWK's annual dividend growth potential by 25 to 50 basis points, too. This is because the company is in a prime position to deliver dividend growth in line with adjusted EPS growth moving forward (its payout ratio is situated perfectly in the middle of its targeted range). At any rate, the Quant System awards A- and B grades for the forward dividend per share and overall dividend growth metrics (the former of which is down from an A grade in January and the latter of which is up from a B- grade).</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks To Consider</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AWK is a fundamentally thriving water utility. However, it still faces risks that could challenge the investment thesis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Just as I discussed in January, the most consequential risk to AWK remains the pending merger with WTRG. Now that shareholders of both companies <a href=\"https://ir.amwater.com/news-and-events/financial-releases/financial-release-details/2026/American-Water-and-Essential-Utilities-Shareholders-Approve-Merger-Related-Proposals-at-Special-Shareholder-Meetings/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">overwhelmingly approved the deal</a> earlier this month, the obstacles that must still be navigated to get this deal finalized are federal regulators (the Federal Trade Commission) and state regulators (e.g., Pennsylvania and New Jersey's public utility commissions).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The most challenging hurdle to clear remains approvals from state regulators in every state where AWK and/or WTRG have significant operations. Quelling <a href=\"https://www.inquirer.com/business/american-water-essentials-merger-risk-20251101.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">legal opposition</a> to the deal is likely going to involve some concessions on the part of the companies, such as promising not to raise rates for two or three years and not laying off local workers for a set period. These trade-offs could temporarily hurt the combined company's profit margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If the deal is finalized, then there's the potential that AWK can't achieve its anticipated synergies. If that happens, it could be a major blow to the logic for doing the deal in the first place. That could put some downward pressure on AWK's growth story.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk to AWK is that while it's already a high-value target for hackers, a completed merger with WTRG would likely further enhance its appeal. If any major cyber breaches are successful, that could set AWK back with regulatory penalties and lawsuits.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One last risk to the water utility is that the environment in which it operates could become unfavorable. What do I mean?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, an <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/pri/topics/livable-communities/utilities/utility-costs-affordability-poll/\" rel=\"nofollow\">AARP survey</a> from last year found that at least three out of four Americans age 50 and older were worried about their utilities going up. Since this demographic tends to be the largest voting bloc, the risk is that such a sentiment could cause regulators to limit the extent of AWK's rate increases. Combined with higher capex, this could weigh on the company's growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a worst-case scenario, adverse rate case outcomes could lead rating agencies to downgrade AWK's credit ratings. That could raise its cost of capital, putting its current capex ambitions at risk.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary: A Boring Way To Collect Double-Digit Total Returns</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On its own, AWK is arguably a best-in-breed water utility. In my view, this would only likely be enhanced if the deal for WTRG is completed. The company's 7% to 9% annual adjusted EPS growth target is the strongest in the industry. Its A-rated balance sheet is also impressive.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shares also look moderately undervalued. Overall, the current valuation provides a realistic path to 10%+ annual total returns over the medium term. That's why I'm reiterating my Buy rating.</p>",

The stock has fewer than 10k followers on SA, company information is sparse and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> it is not a business many investors would think of as an investment opportunity. This is part of its beauty.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The business model will never be disrupted, the demand will always be there and it will stand the test of time. Service Corporation is North America’s leading provider of funeral, cremation and cemetery services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To understand what shaped this company, low key profile and conservative business model, we first need to take a look at it from a historical lens. </p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Historical Viewpoint</h2> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The death scare in 1999</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the late 1990s, the SCI’s founder, <a href=\"https://nmfh.org/robert-waltrip/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robert Waltrip</a>, pursued a hyper-aggressive growth <a href=\"https://portersfiveforce.com/blogs/brief-history/sci-corp\" rel=\"noopener\">strategy</a>. The company acquired thousands of family operated funeral homes and cemeteries globally to consolidate them under SCI. To fund its expansion, SCI took on large amounts of debt and accepted lower returns on capital, just to sustain its growth momentum. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even in a predictable business like this, <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/global-metrics/countries/usa/united-states/death-rate\" rel=\"nofollow\">mortality rates</a> can and will fluctuate over time. 1999 marked the tipping point for the company where slightly lower mortality rates combined with high leverage created ripple effects. In October that year, the company published a quarterly report that greatly disappointed investors and the stock plummeted over 50%, in one day.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This sell-off created a market panic and SCI was no longer able to sell shares to fund acquisitions needed to keep the growth going. With interest payments that needed to be serviced, the company started a fire-sale of its assets and pulled out from the international markets. SCI managed by a thin margin to stabilize and recover over time. SCI stopped trying to take over the world and focused on becoming a lean, North American cash-flow machine. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Today, the company is managed in a conservative fashion. The mindset was forged during the near death experience and instead of expansion, the company is now prioritizing share buybacks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/8/saupload_f70f6106152371c9b1ef047aef4dcfa0.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/8/saupload_f70f6106152371c9b1ef047aef4dcfa0.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/8/saupload_f70f6106152371c9b1ef047aef4dcfa0.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/8/saupload_f70f6106152371c9b1ef047aef4dcfa0.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 2020 pull-forward of demand</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mortality rates can also fluctuate and surprise on the upside. This is exactly what happened when COVID became a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic\" rel=\"nofollow\">global pandemic</a> in 2020. It was an outlier event that generated a massive profit windfall for SCI. The downside was that the succeeding years had very challenging comparisons and it would take years for the company to exceed the high watermark set in 2021. The dust is now settling and the carry-forward effects of the COVID era are behind them. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/27340043-1770232993841946_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2228\" data-height=\"1268\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/27340043-1770232993841946_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"SCI COVID era earnings\" width=\"640\" height=\"364\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/27340043-1770232993841946_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/27340043-1770232993841946_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/27340043-1770232993841946_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/4/27340043-1770232993841946_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>SCI Investor Presentation Q3 2025</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is where we begin our assessment of the company. SCI is showing strong signs of growth again. 2026 could be the year where the stock really takes off for this reliable and resilient dividend machine. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Mortality rates will fluctuate YoY, but over time, it remains a predictable force. We are developing a DCF model to discount future expected cash flow to assess what the company is worth today.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FY25 Performance: Foundation for Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SCI continues to be the undisputed market leader within the fragmented death care industry, holding a revenue market share of about 17%, spanning across Canada and the US. Its competitive advantages being a strong national brand name, operational <a href=\"https://www.sci-corp.com/about\" rel=\"nofollow\">scale</a> and a one-stop shop service provider.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The business model has generated compounded <a href=\"https://filecache.investorroom.com/mr5ir_scicorp/344/Q3%2025%20IR%20Presentation.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">earnings</a> of 8%-12% YoY through organic and capital deployment. Organic growth is achieved through volume and pricing. Capital deployment accounts for the remaining part through investment in the business, <a href=\"https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/SCI/cash-flow/repurchase-of-capital-stock#google_vignette\" rel=\"nofollow\">share buybacks</a> and debt management. A hidden growth lever for this company is also float built up by preened payments, effectively working as an interest-free loan.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2025 marks the year where we are seeing a clear turning point in its <a href=\"https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=101533&amp;ref=319775250&amp;type=HTML&amp;symbol=SCI&amp;cdn=b0ec71006c3e36a82715b83b82f72e45&amp;companyName=Service+Corporation+International&amp;formType=10-K&amp;dateFiled=2026-02-12\" rel=\"nofollow\">results</a>. Revenue up 2.9% YoY, mainly driven growth from Service revenue and Other revenue. Operating Income increased by 5.4%, as the company is starting to normalize the margins to historical levels observed before COVID. G&amp;A continued to decline as % of total revenue, which is a testament to greater efficiency in the business and Net Income improved by 4.6% YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company continued to buy back shares and reduced diluted number of shares by -2.8%. SCI also delivered its guidance target of high-single to low double-digits EPS growth in 2025.

Our conservative scenario indicates an upside of 6.42% and the base scenario a 24.38% upside from current level, excluding dividends. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Factors that support an even higher stock price valuation could be stronger revenue growth over the plan period and/or a lower WACC assumed in the optimistic scenario.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Factors that support a more conservative scenario include a slowdown in its Service Revenue, driven by the ongoing secular shift towards cremation. <a href=\"https://nfda.org/news/media-center/nfda-news-releases/id/9786/nfda-releases-2025-cremation-burial-report-comprehensive-insights-to-guide-the-future-of-funeral-service\" rel=\"nofollow\">NFDA</a> estimate that the cremation rate will reach 63.4% in 2025, more than double that of burial rate of 31.6%. This trend is expected to continue. By 2045, cremations are expected to rise to 82% of dispositions. Cremation pressures the profitability for SCI, as urns are lower margins than high value merchandise like caskets. SCI has thus far been able to offset this through price increases in its traditional services, but its pricing power is not unlimited.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk factor is SCI's high <a href=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-SCI/financials-statistics-and-ratios/debt-to-equity/\" rel=\"nofollow\">debt-to-equity ratio </a>to fund its large share buyback programs. If interest rates rise or if the company receives a credit rating downgrade, the resulting high interest expense would eat into the dividend payments and free cash flow. In addition to this, higher rates would increase the WACC and necessitate a lower valuation reflected in the conservative case. </p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, considering the predictability of the business, conservative operations, interest rates going down and strong implied upside in our DCF model for all scenarios, we recommend to buy the stock, currently trading at $79.20. </p>",

While we continue<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to believe in the risks associated to the debasement trade, longer dated rates have come down considerably and we think it's on the following factors that have driven the recovery in long duration fixed income bets:</span></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>YTM declines driven by a weaker, more immediate outlook about the economy</li> <li>The Supreme Court decision that in principle should require Trump to find another basis for his executive tariffs - disinflationary from productivity expansion</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We aren't particularly positive on the economy. As far as the tariffs are concerned, we imagine that they will come back in some way, just has to be on a different legal basis and may not even need to go through Congress after all. For now the President is using the <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2026/obstacles-facing-trumps-next-attempt-imposing-tariffs\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economics/2026/obstacles-facing-trumps-next-attempt-imposing-tariffs\" target=\"_blank\">BoP authority</a> which is temporary (150 days) before a more solid foundation will be needed for the tariffs which we think he will likely find, though there is the upside if he doesn't. While a weak economic outlook could support duration bets, we continue to maintain the concerns around the debasement trade such that bets like these are excessively risky for the limited fixed income rewards that Treasuries provide.</p> <figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_33336eefd76fda113243cdbb3025376e.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_33336eefd76fda113243cdbb3025376e.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_33336eefd76fda113243cdbb3025376e.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_33336eefd76fda113243cdbb3025376e.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ycharts.com\" target=\"_blank\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SCHQ Breakdown</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The portfolio's effective duration is <a href=\"https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schq\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schq\" target=\"_blank\">13.8 years,</a> which is quite a lot of duration. 22 years is the effective average maturity. <a href=\"https://www.worldgovernmentbonds.com/country/united-states/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.worldgovernmentbonds.com/country/united-states/\" target=\"_blank\">Compared to 12 months ago</a>, YTMs at the 20 year range are the same as today but they've come down considerably from the 6 and 3 month mark which is the period in which the debasement trade started to take effect. As a recap, the debasement trade is the idea that geopolitics and Trump has affected the attractiveness of the USD as a reserve currency, thereby threatening government capital access in the US and raising longer term rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The decision of the Supreme Court that the emergency powers of the President don't cover tariff policy has led to the current tariffs being called illegal. While there is time to find a new legal authority to found the tariffs on, should the tariffs disappear a major geopolitical hiccup and inflationary force would be unwound, hence the reduction of shorter and also longer term rates as the productivity benefits from lower tariffs with a key player like the US would accrue in the long-term as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To elaborate on the other reason why the rates are coming down, there are some worries about the economy. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/us-companies-announce-most-job-cuts-for-any-january-since-2009?cmpid=eveus\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-05/us-companies-announce-most-job-cuts-for-any-january-since-2009?cmpid=eveus\" target=\"_blank\">US job cuts</a> were surging a bit in January. <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/employment-rate\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/employment-rate\" target=\"_blank\">Employment rates</a> have been going down. <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/labor-force-participation-rate\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/labor-force-participation-rate\" target=\"_blank\">Participation rates</a> have also been a bit lower YoY. The main thinking is that this has been on the back of AI. There could be a demand side issue if it translates into a more pervasive white collar anxiety about AI taking jobs. All of this pushes down on rates as it becomes an apparent possibility than unencumbered by inflation, the Fed may lean into attacking the growth mandate. Theoretically, the AI development itself could be disinflationary if it does enough for productivity. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-30/warsh-set-to-face-early-reality-check-as-trump-s-man-at-the-fed\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-30/warsh-set-to-face-early-reality-check-as-trump-s-man-at-the-fed\" target=\"_blank\">This is what the incoming Fed chair, Warsh, is hoping for</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The assumptions behind the USD reserve currency status determine so much of the dollar's value and of the capital access of the US to keep refinancing its balance sheet. We'd rather not take these FI bets that could be tanked on these major revisions in assumptions, though we do think the risks are remote and that the checks and balances in the US proving themselves should be enough to start restoring the slightly wobbly USD trust. Other than that, if we see a <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-confidence\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/consumer-confidence\" target=\"_blank\">clearer decline in consumer sentiment surveys</a>, that could be a sign that the second order anxiety driven effects of the AI threat to employment may start adding more pressure on general economic outlook which would be good for sensitive bets to YTM on the downside. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court ruling may not be a durable help to duration bets assuming a new legal foundation is found for the tariffs, though maybe SCHQ holders will be lucky and the tariffs will actually go away unless congress enacts them. But a new foundation for the tariffs would be the most imminent negative news for duration long exposures. So we still have too few reasons to stop worrying about flare ups in the debasement trade, particularly if the next phase of tariffs includes tactics for government overreach.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But in terms of expense ratios, SCHQ is a better instrument than iShares alternative (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TLT\" title=\"iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF\">TLT</a>) with similar durations but a <a href=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239454/ishares-20-year-treasury-bond-etf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239454/ishares-20-year-treasury-bond-etf\" target=\"_blank\">0.15%</a> expense ratio against a <a href=\"https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schq\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schq\" target=\"_blank\">0.03%</a>.</p>",

It is one of <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/healthcare/genomics-stocks/gene-editing-stocks/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">several</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> gene-editing biotech companies developing novel treatments to cure genetic diseases. Its key focus is a form of gene therapy called base editing, which is proprietary for Beam, using an enzyme to convert DNA bases, for example from C to T or A to G. It is said to offer more consistent gene sequencing outcomes and less genotoxicity than the Crispr Cas-9 technology, which has become better known over the last few years. Beam is the undisputed leader in this particular type of gene editing, which holds great potential.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-1772175845024193_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1398\" data-height=\"650\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-1772175845024193_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Graphic showing technology\" width=\"640\" height=\"298\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-1772175845024193_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-1772175845024193_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-1772175845024193_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-1772175845024193_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Beam Therapeutics</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From initially casting its net quite wide across a handful of different conditions, in 2023 it decided to <a href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/beam-lays-about-100-employees-and-deprioritizes-car-t-programs-push-runway-2026\" rel=\"nofollow\">prioritize its financial and human resources</a> on the pathways most likely to achieve success, principally to extend its cash runway.

Bluebird Bio also saw is <a href=\"https://www.lyfgenia.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lyfgenia</a> SCD treatment approved by the FDA, before struggles with take-up led it to seek a <a href=\"https://www.biospace.com/deals/bluebird-facing-cash-crunch-to-go-private-in-deal-valued-at-30m\" rel=\"nofollow\">private buy-out</a> and <a href=\"https://www.biospace.com/business/bye-bye-bluebird-gene-therapy-biotech-emerges-from-private-buyout-with-rebrand\" rel=\"nofollow\">corporate rebrand</a> last year. The one-time curative treatments that Casgevy and Lyfgenia offer are what Beam is up against with its risto-cel treatment; this is the bar that has been set.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Vertex/Crispr and the renamed Genetix Biotherapeutics have a several-year head start on Beam, it is possible that Beam’s treatment could become the industry standard in time, but this is by no means guaranteed. Their management argues that their specific gene editing technique is better than Crispr Cas-9, which involves the use of an enzyme to make double-stranded breaks/cuts in DNA and repair them. This technique is argued to create cells with varying levels of effectiveness (they are inconsistent) and the process could, theoretically, cause mutations and off-target effects through the harmful rearrangement of chromosomes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It must be said, though, that the latter outcome was not seen in any of their clinical trials. What base editing does, by contrast, is to limit this variability in cells – and therefore mitigate the risks involved – by eliminating double-stranded breaks entirely. While Crispr Cas-9 is used, conceptually, like a pair of scissors, <a href=\"https://beamtx.com/science/base-editing-applications/\" rel=\"nofollow\">base editing is like a pencil that can erase and rewrite</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In November 2024, <a href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/beam-hits-hemoglobin-goal-first-base-editing-clinical-data-reports-death-tied-conditioning\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beam announced results</a> from its first trial (BEACON phase 1/2), which offered data on just 4 patients. The data was very promising, as the treatment brought HbF levels up above 70%, which was above its target of &gt;60%. At this level, in a clinical setting, we’re talking nearly “normal,” essentially asymptomatic with no VOCs occurring. This is obviously a slight but meaningful improvement on what Casgevy offers. More recently, in December 2025, <a href=\"https://investors.beamtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beam-therapeutics-reports-updated-data-beacon-phase-12-trial\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beam provided updated figures from its cohort of 29 patients</a> in the phase 1/2 trial. Patients maintained mean HbF levels above 60%, with a mean reduction in corresponding HbS levels below 40%. Researcher Dr. Ashish Gupta also remarked on its comparatively quicker engraftment and fewer hospitalizations:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>Given the cumbersome nature of the transplant process, it is encouraging that patients receiving risto-cel are on average experiencing a low number of cell collection cycles, rapid neutrophil and platelet engraftment, and low neutropenic days post-risto-cel treatment. Each of these factors contributes to fewer days in the hospital, potentially improving the overall patient experience.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450915744_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1325\" data-height=\"607\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450915744_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Graphic showing drug potential\" width=\"640\" height=\"293\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450915744_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450915744_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450915744_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450915744_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Beam Therapeutics</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One patient unfortunately died during the phase 1/2 trial, very early on (one of the first 4 to be studied). The researcher concluded that this was unrelated to risto-cel specifically, but instead to do with the preliminary myeloablative conditioning protocol, which requires <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/busulfan-intravenous-route/description/drg-20067303\" rel=\"nofollow\">Busulfan</a> (a chemotherapy drug that rids the body of its bone marrow). It nevertheless highlights the problem for risto-cel at this point. For it to truly challenge Casgevy (and to a lesser extent Lyfgenia) – especially considering that Vertex is so much better funded as a company and so brings with it numerous advantages in manufacturing, distribution, and marketing – risto-cel must offer real, tangible, clinical benefits for patients. Early data suggests slightly superior efficacy as I noted above, but the real benefit will be if the conditioning protocol can lessen the patient burden. Indeed, a recent report suggested that the slow take-up of both Casgevy and Lyfgenia two years post-approval has mostly been related to <a href=\"https://www.biospace.com/drug-development/sickle-cell-gene-therapies-casgevy-and-lyfgenia-still-lacking-traction-2-years-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">negative sentiment</a> surrounding the conditioning protocol. No doubt risto-cel will experience the same slow take-up unless they can overcome this challenge.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Challenges of Pre-Treatment Conditioning</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Like Casgevy and Lyfgenia, at present risto-cel requires myeloablative conditioning (Busulfan), which brings a host of nasty possible side-effects, including infertility, veno-occlusive liver disease, nausea, vomiting, mouth sores, and low blood cell counts (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia). The most troubling of these is infertility, especially for young people, and while Vertex offer “fertility preservation services” for patients insured commercially, this does not cover those under the Medicaid program. In mid-2024, <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/vertex-sue-hhs-casgevy-sickle-cell-fertility-treatment-aks/721417/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vertex sued the U.S. government</a> for blocking their offer of financial support (up to $70,000 per patient), but in 2025 a U.S. court <a href=\"https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/dc-court-backs-hhs-denying-vertexs-proposed-fertility-support-coverage-program-casgevy\" rel=\"nofollow\">rejected the suit</a>. This continues to represent a challenge for Vertex in terms of the broad take-up of Casgevy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Returning to risto-cel, while the patient experience might be slightly better than Casgevy at this point, I believe that the true promise of risto-cel is predicated upon the results stemming from follow-up trials BEAM-103 and BEAM-104 (part of the ESCAPE program). Both of these are anti-CD117 monoclonal antibodies that are intended to either suppress or eliminate HSPCs. BEAM-104 has shown <a href=\"https://trial.medpath.com/news/61acb29213ef1585/sickle-cell-patient-dies-in-beam-study-of-base-editing-therapy-biopharma-dive\" rel=\"nofollow\">promising preclinical data</a> (in animal studies), while Beam-103 is advancing human trials presently. In simple terms, what they offer is the potential to use risto-cel in a different way. It offers a non-genotoxic, non-chemotherapeutic alternative to traditional myeloablative conditioning for the blood stem cell transplants required in patient conditioning. The advancement of this treatment to replace toxic chemotherapy in patients preparing to undergo risto-cel treatment would be a real “game changer” that would position it as superior to Casgevy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, investors here need to understand that Vertex/Crispr are not sitting on their hands with Casgevy, but are also responding to the challenge of Casgevy’s unattractive conditioning protocol. In response, <a href=\"https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/vertex-orum-conditioning-gene-editing-dacs/721473/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vertex partnered with Orum Therapeutics</a> who is developing degrader-antibody conjugates, or DACs, for gene editing preconditioning. It offers a “safer and gentler” conditioning regimen for patients, which Vertex can use to entice more SCD patients to undergo its Casgevy treatment. Also, its commercial partner <a href=\"https://ir.crisprtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/crispr-therapeutics-provides-business-update-and-reports-13/#:~:text=CRISPR%20Therapeutics%20continues%20to%20advance,without%20the%20need%20for%20conditioning.\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crispr Therapeutics is developing an anti-CD117 antibody-drug conjugate</a> of its own, which is intended to eliminate HSPCs through a non-genotoxic and non-chemotherapeutic agent, in addition to developing an in-vivo application which removes the need for conditioning altogether. The latter, however, remains in preclinical stage, so is perhaps slightly behind Beam in this regard. I believe these advances should have a material impact on Casgevy sales within the next few years, in my estimation, as patients and physicians learn of these improvements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For risto-cel, <a href=\"https://investors.beamtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beam-therapeutics-sets-strategic-priorities-its-genetic-disease/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beam recently announced</a> that they are \"now prioritizing <em>in vivo </em>delivery for its next wave approach in SCD, complementing risto-cel as a potential best-in-class <em>ex vivo</em> therapy.\"</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450096262_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1430\" data-height=\"637\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450096262_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Graphic showing drug potential\" width=\"640\" height=\"285\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450096262_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450096262_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450096262_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758450096262_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Beam Therapeutics</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For its current ex-vivo treatment, the company plans to submit a BLA (Biologics License Application) to the FDA before the end of 2026. If fast-tracked or given priority attention by the FDA, approval for risto-cel could arrive in mid/late 2027, with commercialization likely in 2028. All of this assumes further positive data and no delays. As such, while their drug might hold grater promise as a treatment for SCD in the long run, Beam are entering this race a significant distance behind Vertex/Crispr, and this could have a negative impact on much-needed revenue generating opportunities post-approval. However, if they can survive this period without significant shareholder dilution through debt financing and bring their better product to the forefront of patient and physician attention, I see significant upside ahead. Again, however, this is by no means guaranteed and investors may wish to watch from the sidelines for the next year or so to determine their cash spend and research trial progress before investing. There are too many unknowns at this point, and an investment here – based on risto-cel at least – would be speculative.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s turn to their other program now, which could have a material impact on their revenue growth over the course of the next few years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Liver-Targeted Program</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this program, Beam are targeting Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) with their BEAM-302 trial, their most advanced in this space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758452313657_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1445\" data-height=\"304\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758452313657_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Graphic of drug pipeline\" width=\"640\" height=\"135\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758452313657_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758452313657_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758452313657_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758452313657_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Beam Therapeutics</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Severe AATD (with the most common homozygous PiZ genotype) impacts more than 100,000 people in the U.S., and there are limited treatment options available. AATD is a <a href=\"https://www.sanofi.com/en/magazine/your-health/cause-copd-alpha-one-antitrypsin-deficiency\" rel=\"nofollow\">genetic disease that can lead to premature emphysema and COPD</a>. For patients, the liver does not produce enough AAT protein, which then causes lung damage. For the lungs, the only treatment is IV augmentation therapy given weekly, but this is by no means curative; it merely <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6680306/\" rel=\"nofollow\">slows the progression of lung tissue loss</a>. AATD can also cause cirrhosis in the liver, but there are no approved treatments for this. In both cases – for lung and liver – patients often end up on the transplant list.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The promise of BEAM-302 is to cure the disease by correcting the faulty gene that causes AATD at its root and thereby restore the proper functioning of the liver and AAT protein production.

It did show a high level of patient tolerability, with all reported adverse events being \"mild to moderate,\" such as \"Grade 1 asymptomatic elevations in liver enzymes (ALT and AST) and transient Grade 1 infusion-related reactions,\" none of which required special treatment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, the company has extended the trial – assessing different dosing levels – and, in a progress update, <a href=\"https://investors.beamtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beam-therapeutics-sets-strategic-priorities-its-genetic-disease/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported in January</a> that more than 25 AATD patients have been treated. Beam plans to enroll approximately 50 additional patients to support a future BLA submission to the FDA, and they recently secured a potential accelerated approval pathway. The company plans to update investors on their progress and release updated data from the Phase 1/2 trial by the end of Q1 2026, a few weeks away.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BEAM-301, which is slightly behind 302 in terms of testing and approval progress, offers another indication for Beam’s base editing biotechnology platform. It aims to correct the R83C mutation in patients with glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSDIa), which is a condition that impacts a patient’s ability to convert glycogen back to glucose to sustain blood sugar. Patients are at constant risk of hypoglycemia, which can lead to seizures, coma, or even death, and the current standard of care is 2-4 hourly doses of cornstarch, even overnight. Bringing enzymatic activity up above 11% is considered the threshold for restoring normal activity, which is sufficient to correct metabolic abnormalities and normalize blood sugar in the R83C mutations. Beam’s preclinical study (on animals) showed ~60% base-editing efficiency to correct the R83C mutation, which shows its very strong efficacy. This is very promising, and Beam is currently running a Phase 1/2 trial, with dosing in one of the two cohorts now complete and data expected before the end of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758456940405_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"891\" data-height=\"521\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758456940405_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Graphic of trial plans\" width=\"640\" height=\"374\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758456940405_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758456940405_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758456940405_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758456940405_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Beam Therapeutics</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Also, on Tuesday, the <a href=\"https://investors.beamtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beam-therapeutics-reports-fourth-quarter-and-year-end-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">company announced its third clinical program</a> (BEAM-304) in its liver-targeted genetic disease, for the disease <a href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/phenylketonuria/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phenylketonuria</a> (PKU). PKU affects approximately 1 in every 25,000 people in the U.S. (potentially 20,000 people in the U.S.), and increases the amount of phenylalanine in the blood. This is an amino acid (protein building block) that is also found in certain foods, like meat, eggs, and dairy, but also aspartame. Too much Phenylalanine can cause intellectual disability among other serious health problems, so “treatments” for the disease involve heavy dietary restrictions. There is no known cure, which presents an excellent opportunity for Beam or another biotech company to develop one. <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4728993/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gene therapy</a> is considered in the scientific community to offer the best opportunity for a curative treatment, and this is what Beam is targeting.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Beam’s Potential Moat</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I view Beam’s liver-targeted program to be their greatest potential revenue-generating asset, given the competition in this space is less intense than in the metabolic program (risto-cel, for SCD and beta-thalassemia). I share management’s enthusiasm for developing curative treatments across their two pipelines as a potential bonanza for the company and its shareholders, but it could take several years for this to come to fruition with meaningful revenue. Beam’s CEO John Evans <a href=\"https://www.stocktitan.net/news/BEAM/beam-therapeutics-reports-fourth-quarter-and-year-end-2025-financial-tzz64aid0dn4.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">remarked on the PKU expansion news</a> that it \"exemplifies the power and scalability of our platform,\" which could, theoretically, target a whole host of different conditions through its proprietary technology, including blood disorders, liver and metabolic diseases, pulmonary and gastro-intestinal diseases, ophthalmology, oncology and CNS and neuromuscular diseases.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Authors of an exploratory study in the <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7503568/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>International Journal of Molecular Science</em> in 2020</a> concluded:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p><em>`DNA base-editing and prime-editing has remarkable potential as a therapeutic tool to correct disease-causing mutations in the human genome. Over 25% of human pathogenic SNPs can be corrected by targeting the four transition mutations, and in principle prime-editing could correct up to 89% of known genetic variants associated with human disease.</em></p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">An SNP – a Single Nucleotide Polymorphism – is a specific type of genetic variation whereby a single nucleotide (reflected by A, T, C, or G in the DNA sequence) has been replaced by another, which directly causes a disease or disorder. These are very common occurrences, in about 1% of the population. As such, it seems that the potential for Beam in this space – being the only major player – is enormous, if they can get it right (showing high efficacy and safety). They are leading the way and will very likely be first to market here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I perceive the main risk to be its balance sheet and its likely long, winding and uncertain pathway toward profitability. I would posit that once they receive FDA approval for BEAM-302 – which could take another 18-24 months if all goes according to plan – they will have built a moat around their business, which can be used to expand their pipeline into several different disease areas, especially those considered “orphan”—that is: diseases previously ignored by big pharma. It is likely that they will need both risto-cel and Beam-302 approvals in order to survive, but I have confidence given the strong efficacy and safety profiles already demonstrated in clinical trials of each. It will just take time, and the company will need to fund its operations (almost) entirely from its balance sheet to sustain themselves.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Financial Considerations</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beam reported a modest amount of revenue in 2025, mainly from collaboration/licensing deals, but this injection of cash flow is inconsistent quarter over quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758447015316_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"735\" data-height=\"399\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758447015316_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Revenue chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"347\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758447015316_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758447015316_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758447015316_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/53083348-17721758447015316_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>StockAnalysis</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company is unlikely to generate any revenue from product sales for another two years, so investors have a tough time of properly valuing this company. The only real decent valuation measure of a pre-revenue company like this is its TAM, which is of course highly subjective. I would nevertheless consider it quite large given the different diseases they could target with base editing, and the pricing power that having the only curative treatment for these diseases could bring. However, investors also have to factor in balance sheet risks, principally dilution caused by debt-financing. Shareholders would have celebrated <a href=\"https://investors.beamtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beam-therapeutics-announces-500-million-strategic-financing\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent news of Sixth Street financing</a> to the tune of $500 million, which pushes out its cash runway to 2029, and will help facilitate the commercialization of risto-cel. The terms of the deal</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>includes $100 million funded at close; up to $300 million available upon the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones for risto-cel; and an additional $100 million available at Beam’s option, subject to mutual agreement between the parties, during the seven-year term of the agreement.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Beam also <a href=\"https://investors.beamtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beam-therapeutics-reports-fourth-quarter-and-year-end-2025\" rel=\"nofollow\">secured a recent deal</a> with Pfizer (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFE\" title=\"Pfizer Inc.\">PFE</a>), extending their four-year collaboration focused on <em>in vivo </em>base editing programs. The arrangement offers Pfizer \"an exclusive, worldwide license for a liver-targeted development candidate,\" which will employ Beam’s \"proprietary liver-targeting LNP to deliver base editing reagents.\" Pfizer will be responsible for developing the drug, securing regulatory approvals, manufacturing, and commercialization, and in return Beam will receive milestone payments alongside the future right to opt in – following the completion of the Phase 1/2 trials – to pay an option exercise fee that secures a global co-development and co-commercialization agreement. This would allow it to share, at a 35/65 split, the new profits from the treatment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I view this collaboration with a world-leading biopharmaceutical company as a major win for Beam, reminiscent of <a href=\"https://investors.vrtx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vertex-and-crispr-therapeutics-establish-collaboration-use\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crispr’s collaboration with Vertex</a> from 2015, which is still going strong over a decade later. Not only providing financial support and leadership/mentorship, the agreement also validates Beam’s proprietary technology and clinical approach.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Presently, Beam have cash and short-term investments of $1.245 billion but burned through $360 million in the previous 12 months ($87 million in Q4 2025 alone). The company has managed to grow its cash pile 46.4% over the past year, from $850 million at the end of 2024. They have total debt of $154 million, which gives them a net cash position of $1.09 billion, representing $10.4 per share. With a market cap of $2.87 billion, investors buying now will receive – subtracting their (net) cash pile – the company’s assets (including property, plant and equipment valued at $205 million) for $1.78 billion, or roughly $18.50 per share. This includes their IP, brand, partnerships &amp; collaborations, and other intangible assets. At a price/book ratio of 2.32, this does not seem overly demanding, and I note that this value has remained between 2.2 and 2.8 for the past 3 years.

However, news related to delays, regulatory missteps, unexpectedly poor clinical data read-outs, expanding overhead costs, or collaborative failures could force the company to seek further cash and debt financing. This may come in 2027 as they gear up to FDA submissions, manufacturing ramp and commercialization. All told, while shareholders have suffered somewhat over the previous few years as BEAM shares have underperformed the market, I feel the worst may be behind it as it gears up to, in all likelihood, a swathe of positive news coming in the back half of 2026 and into next year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In conclusion, I rate Beam a very promising biotech company, with a technological competitive advantage in its proprietary base-editing IP. Their two-pronged approach theoretically helps to de-risk the investment case, while their collaboration with Pfizer (among other companies I neglected to mention) provides validation of their unique gene editing approach and its potential. The moderate risk of dilution to my mind is more than offset by the progress being made to bring its two leading products (risto-cel and BEAM-302) to market, but investors should have patience as this is a 5-10 year story before the full potential of the company may be apparent.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The BEAM share price will likely continue to fluctuate – and may continue to be range-bound for the time being – so it is possible that a better entry point presents itself in time. This is especially considering how volatile the market is presently. However, I believe on balance that long-term shareholders will be rewarded here. For those will to be patient, I rate shares a <em>Buy</em>.</p>",

Emphasis on protein is a prevalent thread in packaged food industry investor materials and market chatter.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investor Takeaways</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I'm tempted to rate Hormel at hold in order to avoid the wrath of its most loyal and patient investors. However, given a long and extraordinarily painful history of flat revenues, falling earnings, and negative returns, investors would be most correct to demand real improvements.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hormel's annualized 1Q26 earnings at $1.32 fall short of consensus estimated YE26 and even YE24 earnings. Even the top end of the company's forward earnings guidance at $1.46/share falls short of YE24's $1.47 share. So far, earnings appear likely to disappoint.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lastly, I don't expect Hormel to produce returns by chasing the consumer trend around protein alongside its peers. I recommend investors carefully consider selling Hormel at current market prices.</p>",

The company beat both top- and bottomline expectations, and delivered a year-over-year sales growth of 10.1%. Double-digit sales growth in the current macroeconomic environment is impressive. Even more impressive that the top-line growth cascaded down all the way till EPS, with gross profit expanding, SG&amp;A contracting, and operating margin expanding.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721107414933212_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"830\" data-height=\"1050\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721107414933212_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"810\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721107414933212_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721107414933212_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721107414933212_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721107414933212_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Results <span>(Urban Outfitters)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So let <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"us\" htloopnumber=\"404899702\">us</em> start breaking down these results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The following table shows the firm's sales by segment. Total sales reached $1.8 billion in the quarter a record for URBN. The retail segment - the largest segment - brought in $1.5665 billion, representing an 8% growth compared to the prior year. Each of the brands contributed to this growth, with Urban Outfitters being the strongest growth driver. These figures clearly indicate that the demand for the firm's products remains high. The growth was driven by increases in sessions and average order value through the digital channels, as well as by higher traffic and higher average unit retail in stores.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not only the retail segment grew, but also the wholesale, driven by the strong demand for Free People by specialty customers. The subscription segment growth was driven by a 40% higher active subscriber base.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The growth was definitely broader-based in terms of brands and segments, but it was also broad-based geographically. Both North American sales, and European and Rest of the World sales grew.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721107936332812_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1042\" data-height=\"964\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721107936332812_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"592\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721107936332812_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721107936332812_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721107936332812_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721107936332812_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Sales by segment <span>(Urban Outfitters)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, these figures are a strong indication that people want URBN's products globally, despite the macroeconomic circumstances. For this reason, I find the business attractive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is not only the sales growth that impresses. Sometimes retailers achieve sales growth by steep discounting and therefore by sacrificing profitability. This is not the case for URBN. Their retail segment gross profit margin expanded from 33.1% to 34.5% YoY. The expansion was driven by:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>lower markdowns at Urban Outfitters and Free People</li> <li>leverage in store occupancy costs</li> <li>leverage in delivery expense due to a reduction in packages per order</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These were partially offset by deleverage in initial merchandise costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The subscription segment margin also expanded by 50 bps, driven by the leverage in logistics expenses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last, but not least, we also have to mention the wholesale segment. While gross profit grew in absolute terms, the margins of this segment shrank, due to tariffs. Nowadays, we have to keep in mind that the rapidly changing tariff policies are far reaching. And the uncertainty around these policies remains a significant risk not just for URBN, but for most businesses. </p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721108731019573_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1030\" data-height=\"844\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721108731019573_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"524\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721108731019573_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721108731019573_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721108731019573_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/56413274-17721108731019573_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Segment margins <span>(Urban outfitters)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operating income margin expanded to 8.8% from 7.7% in the year ago quarter, primarily driven by the stronger gross profits.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FORM\" title=\"FormFactor, Inc.\">FORM</a></span>) is one of the best performing stocks this year as it is up 75% YTD. Since reporting <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4547414-formfactor-non-gaap-eps-of-0_46-beats-by-0_11-revenue-of-215_1m-beats-by-4_5m\">Q4 2025 earnings</a> on February 4th, the stock has been on a strong run, setting<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> new all-time highs consistently. FormFactor’s post-earnings rally hasn’t been without merit as the probe card specialist reported record revenues and expanded its margins significantly due to improved manufacturing efficiencies. These results are promising signs for the company’s performance in FY 2026, in my opinion, since it is well positioned to maintain its strong growth figures thanks to the HBM4 cycle.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a probe card supplier to the top-3 high bandwidth memory (\"HBM\") makers, FormFactor is positioned favorably to benefit from the mass production of HBM4, a feat Samsung (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\">SSNLF</a>) was the first to achieve. At the same time, the company is likely to further benefit from the beginning of HBM4E sampling in the second half of the year. This is due to the higher testing intensity introduced with each new generation of HBM due to the higher layer and pin count, leading probe cards to wear out at a more rapid pace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While FormFactor’s capacity is constrained in the near-term until its transition to the Farmers Branch, Texas facility late this year, management stated that there is room for additional manufacturing efficiencies to boost output, a primary factor for the company’s Q4 margin expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the company’s exposure to the HBM4 cycle, I’m forecasting its revenues and adjusted EBIT to grow 18.5% and 67.9%, respectively, in FY 2026, which could be a major catalyst for a re-rating near peer valuation levels. In light of this, I’m rating FormFactor as a Buy with a $122 price target, implying 25% upside potential from current levels.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Business Overview</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FormFactor operates in the semiconductor testing segment as it sells test and measurement equipment such as probe cards, analytical probes, and probe stations that are crucial for testing ICs during wafer fabrication. The company’s probe cards segment is its largest and represented 81.3% of its total revenue in FY 2025, while its systems segment represented 18.7% of its FY 2025 revenue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Probe cards, FormFactor is one part of a duopoly with Technoprobe (TPRO.MI) where it holds the leading market share in DRAM probe cards, whereas Technoprobe leads in probe cards for logic applications. That said, the company has been expanding its capabilities and is regarded as the market leader in testing silicon photonics, a position that was further strengthened with its latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20340028-formfactor-expands-silicon-photonics-test-capabilities-with-acquisition-of-keystone-photonics\">acquisition</a> of Keystone last December.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As probe cards are the core of its business, FormFactor has a highly customized, consumable-driven business model since probe cards are specific to a single chip design. This means that every time a customer releases a new chip or a new version of a chip, they require new probe cards, allowing for repeatable purchases and directly embedding the company into its customers’ future plans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that probe cards are repeatable purchases, FormFactor is a direct beneficiary from the growing adoption of advanced packaging to counter the slowdown in Moore’s law by stacking multiple chiplet layers into a single package. This trend is rapidly increasing the testing intensity of these chips as a single faulty layer could ruin all dies within the entire stack, leading to significant losses to chipmakers. As a result, each single layer must be tested rigorously before stacking to avoid throwing away entire AI modules.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that in mind, a major tailwind to FormFactor is the increasing layer count of HBM. In HBM3E, the industry norm at the moment, HBM makers typically <a href=\"https://www.kynix.com/Blog/hbm3e-vs-hbm4-2026-specs-performance--supply-guide.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">stack</a> 8 to 12 layers. Yet in HBM4, the industry is moving to 12 to 16 layers, depending on end-customer requirements, further increasing the testing intensity of HBM.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, the shift to HBM4 introduces the doubling of each HBM’s pin count from 1024 bits in HBM3E to 2048 bits. The higher pin count means more physical contact points on the probe cards which require more MEMS per card, driving ASPs higher. At the same time, the higher number of landings required per test leads to a faster wear of probe cards, thus creating a faster replacement cycle for worn out probe cards. This effectively creates a sticky, recurring revenue opportunity for FormFactor even if the number of HBM shipments remains flat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This tailwind is bolstered by FormFactor’s impressive customer list, spanning the three largest HBM makers, Samsung, Micron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU\" title=\"Micron Technology, Inc.\">MU</a>), and SK Hynix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HXSC.F\" title=\"SK hynix Inc.\">HXSC.F</a>), its largest customer, as well as TSMC (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>) and Intel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC\" title=\"Intel Corporation\">INTC</a>). As such, FormFactor plays a major role in the AI supply chain as its probe cards are critical for fabricating the AI chips and networking chips required for hyperscale data centers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, FormFactor is working to expand its presence into other areas including merchant GPUs, an area that Technoprobe leads, as well as custom ASICs. To that end, the company is undergoing a qualification for its probe cards in leading edge AI applications and is in the testing reliability stage of the qualification process, per its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4866106-formfactor-inc-form-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q4 earnings call</a>, which could drive an annual revenue opportunity of around $50 million. If the company is successful in this qualification, management expects to start competing or volume orders for GPU probe cards in the first half of 2026, as stated in its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835020-formfactor-inc-form-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Q3 earnings call</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, FormFactor secured design wins from a custom ASIC customer in Q2 that have generated multimillions in revenue in FY 2025 and sees potential for additional opportunities with this customer’s latest ASIC. Thanks to the company’s progress in these areas, it could be well-positioned to start gaining market share from Technoprobe in FY 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given its growing business momentum, FormFactor is working to expand its manufacturing capacity through a new site in Farmers Branch, Texas. The site, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20122956-formfactor-inc-announces-purchase-of-new-manufacturing-facility\">acquired</a> last June for $55 million, is expected to increase the company’s capacity substantially as it comprises 4 structures and includes 50 thousand feet of clean room space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to increasing capacity, the Farmers Branch site should be a major tailwind to FormFactor’s gross margin once fully ramped due to operating in a lower-cost region compared to the company’s existing facilities in California. On that note, FormFactor intends to invest between $140-170 million in capex in FY 2026 for the site to become online in late 2026 and fully ramp in 2027.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Financial Overview</h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top Line Analysis</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a financial perspective, FormFactor’s latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20388513-formfactor-inc-reports-2025-fourth-quarter-results#source=section%3APress%20Releases%7Csection_asset%3APress%20Releases%7Cfirst_level_url%3Asymbol%7Cbutton%3ATitle%7Clock_status%3ANo%7Cline%3A2\">Q4 earnings</a> paint a picture of manufacturing efficiency and operational excellence as it moves to achieve its <a href=\"https://investors.formfactor.com/static-files/fc58604f-f383-4231-8cc8-1a14dceea52c\" rel=\"nofollow\">target model</a> of an $850 million revenue base, a 47% non-GAAP gross margin, and a 22% non-GAAP operating margin to drive a $2 non-GAAP EPS.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the quarter, FormFactor reported 13.6% YoY revenue growth from $189.5 million to $215.2 million, reaching an annualized revenue run rate of more than $860 million, ahead of its model target. The company’s revenue growth during the quarter saw a return to YoY growth after reporting 2.5% and 0.8% YoY declines in the prior two quarters. In my opinion, this signals a major inflection point considering its lower reliance on SK Hynix, its largest customer, during the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q4, <a href=\"https://investors.formfactor.com/static-files/d40f243f-ccb0-489b-b4a8-23f58f90581c\" rel=\"nofollow\">19.2%</a> of FormFactor’s revenue came from SK hynix, the lowest concentration level since Q3 2024 when the HBM giant represented 18.1% of the company’s revenue. This translates to $41.3 million in SK Hynix revenue during the quarter, down 16.8% sequentially from $49.7 million and 0.9% YoY from $41.7 million.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p>Quarter</p></td> <td><p>Revenue</p></td> <td><p>SK Hynix %</p></td> <td><p>Revenue From SK Hynix</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q1 2024</p></td> <td><p>$168,725,000</p></td> <td><p>15.5%</p></td> <td><p>$26,152,375</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q2 2024</p></td> <td><p>$197,474,000</p></td> <td><p>19.5%</p></td> <td><p>$38,507,430</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q3 2024</p></td> <td><p>$207,917,000</p></td> <td><p>18.1%</p></td> <td><p>$37,632,977</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q4 2024</p></td> <td><p>$189,483,000</p></td> <td><p>22.0%</p></td> <td><p>$41,686,260</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q1 2025</p></td> <td><p>$171,356,000</p></td> <td><p>23.3%</p></td> <td><p>$39,925,948</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q2 2025</p></td> <td><p>$195,798,000</p></td> <td><p>25.0%</p></td> <td><p>$48,949,500</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q3 2025</p></td> <td><p>$202,676,000</p></td> <td><p>24.5%</p></td> <td><p>$49,655,620</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q4 2025</p></td> <td><p>$215,163,000</p></td> <td><p>19.2%</p></td> <td><p>$41,311,296</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FormFactor’s sequential shift from double-digit revenue decline to double-digit growth excluding SK Hynix is a major inflection point as it highlights its customer diversification efforts. This is also evident in management’s commentary in the Q4 earnings call, stating that a historically large microprocessor IDM, likely Intel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC\" title=\"Intel Corporation\">INTC</a>), wasn’t a 10% customer during the quarter, whereas Intel was responsible for 12% of the company’s revenue in the first half of FY 2025. This means that the company’s revenue base is becoming more resilient, supporting its potential for durable growth over the coming years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Along with the strong top-line growth, FormFactor’s gross margin expanded significantly YoY during Q4, reporting a 340 bps expansion to its GAAP gross margin from 38.8% to 42.2% and a 370 bps expansion to its non-GAAP gross margin from 40.2% to 43.9%. What’s impressive about this feat is that the company’s margin expansion wasn’t a result of higher ASPs, but due to manufacturing efficiencies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Over the past two quarters, FormFactor took several actions to drive its unit cost lower through reducing and reallocating its workforce, improving yields, and reducing cycle times at its facilities. The higher yields and lower cycle times are specifically promising since they are structural improvements that allow the company to increase output from its existing manufacturing footprint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this way, FormFactor could continue expanding its gross margin over time while reducing the potential impact of product mix and volume shifts. These structural improvements also provide ample upside for the company’s gross margin expansion efforts once HBM4 probe cards represent a higher share of its business due to the ASP tailwinds associated with HBM4’s higher layer count.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The downside, however, is that generating such margin gains in a relatively short time limits near-term gross margin expansion upside as it appears that FormFactor’s capacity is maxed out. While the company’s target revenue is $850 million at current capacity, its Q1 2026 guidance of $225 million implies an annualized rate of $900 million, indicating that running at a revenue level above its target model will likely be driven by pricing, instead of manufacturing efficiencies as was the case in Q4.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, the company is guiding for Q1 2026 adjusted gross margin of 45%, which is equivalent to its target model after including the 200 bps tariff impact, further supporting my view, in my opinion. Therefore, it is crucial that the Farmers Branch facility is ramped on schedule for the company to fully realize the HBM4 opportunity and gross margin expansion potential, especially since the facility is expected to be accretive to gross margin once it is fully ramped.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Bottom Line Analysis</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving on to the bottom-line, FormFactor’s Q4 earnings highlighted its operating leverage. While the company grew its top line by nearly 14% YoY, its GAAP operating costs only increased by 2.3% from $65.7 million to $67.3 million over the same period, mainly due to a $1.7 million factory setup charge related to the Farmers Branch facility. Excluding this cost, the company’s operating costs remained relatively flat YoY at $65.6 million as it maintained similar R&amp;D and SG&amp;A spending levels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This operating leverage combined with FormFactor’s gross margin gains resulted in a near 200% YoY increase to its operating income from $7.8 million to $23.5 million, driving a 680 bps expansion to its operating margin from 4.1% to 10.9%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a non-GAAP basis, FormFactor reported operating costs of $57.5 million, representing a 4.1% YoY increase from $55.2 million. This increase was primarily driven by the company reporting lower SBC and costs related to acquisitions during the quarter compared to the prior year period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the aforementioned adjusted gross margin expansion, the company reported a 76.7% YoY increase in adjusted operating income from $20.9 million to $36.9 million at a margin of 17.2% compared to 11%, representing a 620 bps expansion. With FormFactor expected to operate at a $900 million revenue run rate, above its target model, and achieve its target adjusted gross margin in FY 2026, its operating leverage could help offset the negative impact from the Farmers Branch facility and its ongoing restructuring efforts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During FY 2026, the company expects to incur $20-25 million in preproduction operating costs related to the ramp of its new facility. Most of these costs will be reported as cost of revenue once the facility is online in late 2026, which could be a headwind to FormFactor’s adjusted gross margin in Q4 2026, unless it is able to drive further gross margin expansion through manufacturing efficiencies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, FormFactor is undergoing a <a href=\"https://investors.formfactor.com/static-files/a139d40d-e246-4c50-af17-11d2ea523b60\" rel=\"nofollow\">restructuring</a> plan to reduce its California footprint ahead of its transition to the Farmers Branch facility. Under this plan, the company is consolidating its Baldwin Park and Carlsbad, California facilities. According to its latest <a href=\"https://investors.formfactor.com/static-files/f533947f-8aa6-4043-9dde-35c31aac81f0\" rel=\"nofollow\">10-K filing</a>, the company has already stopped manufacturing in Baldwin Park in January and expects to end manufacturing in Carlsbad in December 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FormFactor is also reducing its headcount by 200-300 employees, some of which will be retained until the transition is complete. Overall, the company expects to incur between $30-40 million in GAAP charges related to this plan in FY 2026, of which $10-15 million will be cash charges.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This suggests that while FormFactor may achieve its target revenue and adjusted gross margin in FY 2026, achieving its target adjusted operating margin could be a difficult task as a result of these additional costs. However, these costs are crucial to setting the company up for improved profitability in the long-term as it would incur lower taxes, utility costs, and labor rates in Texas compared to California.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that in mind, management intends to share an updated target model on FormFactor’s Analyst Day next May, as shared in the Q4 earnings call. In my opinion, the updated model could be for revenues between $1-1.2 billion, adjusted gross margin between 49-51%, and adjusted operating margin between 25-27% due to the anticipated capacity increase and lower cost structure of the Farmers Branch facility.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Liquidity Analysis</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FORM/cash-flow-statement\">cash flow</a>, FormFactor’s operating leverage is being reflected on its cash conversion. In Q4, the company reported 22.7% YoY growth in free cash flow from $28.2 million to $34.7 million, despite a 47.6% YoY increase in capex from $7.7 million to $11.3 million, as operating cash flow grew 28% from $35.9 million to $46 million. This represented a 120 bps YoY expansion to its FCF margin from 14.9% to 16.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another promising sign is the company’s improved working capital management in Q4 compared to the prior quarter as its adjusted operating income to OCF flow through rate improved sequentially from 94.4% to 124.5%. While the flow through rate was down YoY from 171.8% as a result of higher working capital, driven by increases in accounts receivable and inventory levels, it is directly related to the higher sales volumes reported during the quarter compared to the prior year period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that in mind, it is crucial for Formfactor to continue improving its flow through rate in FY 2026 which is set to be an extremely capex-heavy year ahead of the Farmers Branch going online later this year. As mentioned earlier, the company expects to incur $140-170 million in capex related to the facility and is targeting $30-35 million in capex according to its target model, implying that it could incur between $170-205 million in capex this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As such, maintaining the pace of flow through rate improvement during FY 2026 will be crucial for the company to limit the impact on its existing cash balance, which stood at $275.2 million at the end of FY 2025.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 2-Year HBM4 Cycle Tailwind</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The primary catalyst for FormFactor in FY 2026 is the HBM4 cycle that was kickstarted earlier this month with Samsung being the first to <a href=\"https://semiconductor.samsung.com/news-events/news/samsung-ships-industry-first-commercial-hbm4-with-ultimate-performance-for-ai-computing/#:~:text=HBM4's%20performance%20can%20be%20further,cost%20of%20ownership%20%28TCO%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">commence</a> mass production of HBM4. Samsung’s HBM4 utilizes 12-layer stacking to offer capacities ranging from 24GB to 36GB. Looking ahead, Samsung intends to utilize 16-layer stacking to expand its capacity offerings up to 48GB to align with its customers’ timelines.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Samsung’s announcement follows earlier <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/samsung-start-production-hbm4-chips-next-month-nvidia-supply-source-says-2026-01-25/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reports</a> that it passed HBM4 qualification tests for Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) and AMD (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) ahead of its rivals, SK Hynix and Micron. With that in mind, Micron recently <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4868828-micron-technology-inc-mu-presents-at-wolfe-research-auto-auto-tech-and-semiconductor\">stated</a> that it is ramping HBM4 sample shipments to customers for testing, a quarter ahead of schedule, while SK Hynix is <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2026/02/09/news-samsung-hbm4-reportedly-to-ship-first-after-lunar-new-year-initial-share-projected-at-mid-20/\" rel=\"nofollow\">preparing</a> for mass production following positive qualification tests with Nvidia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given this environment, FormFactor’s revenues in the first half of 2026 could exceed $225 million due to potentially higher HBM4 revenues from Micron and SK Hynix’s ongoing customer qualification. This impact can be similar to the potential contribution from Samsung over the prior two quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On that note, it appears that FormFactor’s Q4 and Q3 2025 revenues saw a larger contribution from Samsung compared to prior quarters. In Q3, FormFactor’s revenue from South Korea grew 70% YoY from $41.7 million to $70.8 million and decelerated in Q4 to 55% from $43 million to $66.6 million.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p>Quarter</p></td> <td><p>South Korea Revenue</p></td> <td><p>YoY</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q1 2024</p></td> <td><p>$50,700,000</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q2 2024</p></td> <td><p>$49,100,000</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q3 2024</p></td> <td><p>$41,700,000</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q4 2024</p></td> <td><p>$43,000,000</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q1 2025</p></td> <td><p>$43,200,000</p></td> <td><p>-14.8%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q2 2025</p></td> <td><p>$57,100,000</p></td> <td><p>16.3%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q3 2025</p></td> <td><p>$70,800,000</p></td> <td><p>69.8%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q4 2025</p></td> <td><p>$66,600,000</p></td> <td><p>54.9%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, excluding SK Hynix, South Korean revenue grew 420% YoY in Q3 from $4.1 million to $21.1 million and accelerated in Q4 to 1825% from $1.3 million to $25.3 million. These revenue levels are near Q1 2024 levels where Samsung represented 12.4% of the company’s revenues, per the latest 10-K, equivalent to $20.9 million, before dwindling as Samsung no longer became a 10% customer in the following quarters.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p>Quarter</p></td> <td><p>South Korea Less SK Hynix</p></td> <td><p>YoY</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q1 2024</p></td> <td><p>$24,547,625</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q2 2024</p></td> <td><p>$10,592,570</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q3 2024</p></td> <td><p>$4,067,023</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q4 2024</p></td> <td><p>$1,313,740</p></td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q1 2025</p></td> <td><p>$3,274,052</p></td> <td><p>-86.7%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q2 2025</p></td> <td><p>$8,150,500</p></td> <td><p>-23.1%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q3 2025</p></td> <td><p>$21,144,380</p></td> <td><p>419.9%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Q4 2025</p></td> <td><p>$25,288,704</p></td> <td><p>1824.9%</p></td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In light of this, I expect FormFactor’s quarterly revenue run rate in the first half of FY 2026 to be near $230 million. Meanwhile, the company could see its quarterly revenue exceed the $230 million mark in the second half of the year as Micron and SK Hynix join Samsung in mass producing HBM4 due to the higher layer and pin counts of HBM4 relative to HBM3E driving higher demand for probe cards.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The primary drivers for this tailwind, in my opinion, are SK hynix's estimated dominant share of Nvidia’s 2026 HBM4 orderbook, along with Samsung’s yield struggles. According to TrendForce, SK hynix is estimated to hold a mid-50% share of Nvidia’s HBM4 needs this year for deployment in Vera Rubin later this year compared to a mid-20% share for Samsung and 20% for Micron, based on Nvidia’s assessment of each supplier’s track record, HBM4 capacity, and qualification success.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This allocation suggests that FormFactor is well-positioned to have a near-guaranteed large probe card sales volume to SK hynix, given that it is the company’s largest customer, which is further supported by management stating that Q1 2026 HBM revenue will be weighted towards SK Hynix. At the same time, FormFactor’s sales to Samsung are likely to grow since Samsung’s yields are currently estimated to be around <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2026/02/13/news-nvidia-may-relax-hbm4-specs-as-samsung-and-sk-hynix-reportedly-face-capacity-yield-limits/\" rel=\"nofollow\">60%</a>, whereas SK hynix achieved a <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/02/27/news-sk-hynix-fast-tracks-hbm4-development-reportedly-hits-70-yield-in-12-layer-testing/\" rel=\"nofollow\">70%</a> HBM4 yield in testing last year, and Micron stated that HBM4 yields are on track.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Samsung’s low yields compared to its peers could be an opportunity for FormFactor this year since low yields typically lead to more probe card orders. This is due to the higher urgency to test HBM more aggressively to find the working chips among the defects, which wears out the needles faster.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another tailwind for FormFactor in the second half of the year is introduction of HBM4E samples. With Samsung expecting to begin sampling HBM4E in the second half of 2026, it is likely that its peers will do the same within the same period to maintain their market presence. This allows FormFactor to capture early probe card demand from the three main HBM players testing their HBM4E samples before shipping to customers for testing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that in mind, HBM4E presents a significantly larger growth opportunity for FormFactor since it will be based on 16-layer stacking, which will further increase testing intensity compared to HBM4, and thus lead to faster wear out of probe cards. Moreover, sales volumes of HBM4E are likely to be significantly higher than HBM4 since Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>, GOOGL), which is responsible for 30% of the total HBM demand, is reportedly <a href=\"https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-it/2026/02/19/ZZ2ED3X2EJEDHD34NZUBM7FAYM/\" rel=\"nofollow\">skipping</a> HBM4 for its AI Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and moving directly to HBM4E. This could potentially boost FormFactor’s HBM probe card sales volumes through FY 2027, when mass production of HBM4E begins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering the positive impact from HBM4 testing on FormFactor’s revenues in the second half of FY 2025, participating in HBM4E testing later in 2026 could have a similar impact on the company’s revenues. Accordingly, I expect FormFactor’s quarterly revenue run rate to approach $240 million in the second half of FY 2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2026 Forecast</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given the aforementioned HBM4 tailwinds, as well as the company’s potential to generate GPU and custom ASIC revenues in FY 2026, I’m forecasting FormFactor’s FY 2026 revenues at $930 million, representing 18.5% YoY growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the company’s near-term capacity constraints can limit further upside, as mentioned earlier, it should be noted that management stated that it can still extract additional output from existing facilities. When combined with the potentially higher ASP of HBM4E probe cards, I believe my FY 2026 revenue forecast is achievable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering the improved manufacturing efficiency associated with operating at such a revenue level, I’m forecasting FormFactor’s adjusted gross margin in FY 2026 at 46%, which translates to a gross profit of $427.8 million.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite my forecasted top-line growth and gross margin expansion, I’m forecasting FormFactor’s adjusted operating costs to represent 27% of my revenue forecast, $251.1 million, representing 16.9% YoY growth. My forecast includes the negative impacts of the factor setup costs associated with the Farmers Branch facility and the restructuring costs the company is set to incur in FY 2026, limiting its adjusted operating margin expansion potential.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on this, I’m forecasting FormFactor’s adjusted operating income at $176.7 million, representing 67.9% YoY growth, and implying an adjusted operating margin of 19%, a 560 bps expansion from the 13.4% margin reported in FY 2025, but still lower than the current target model’s 22%.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td colspan=\"2\"><p>FY 2026 Forecast</p></td> <td><p>YoY</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Revenue</p></td> <td><p>$930,000,000</p></td> <td><p>18.5%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Adj.

While FormFactor may appear overvalued at first glance, its valuation pales in comparison to ATE suppliers Advantest (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ATEYY\" title=\"Advantest Corporation\">ATEYY</a>) and Teradyne (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TER\" title=\"Teradyne, Inc.\">TER</a>) trading at forward EV/EBIT multiples of 47.58 and 46.55, respectively.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, its direct peer Technoprobe trades at a 55.86 forward EV/EBIT multiple based on an FY 2026 EBIT forecast of <a href=\"https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/TECHNOPROBE-S-P-A-133432182/finances/\" rel=\"nofollow\">€198.6 million</a> and an €11.1 billion EV, based on an <a href=\"https://markets.ft.com/data/equities/tearsheet/summary?s=TPRO:MIL\" rel=\"nofollow\">€11.75 billion</a> market cap and a €657 million net cash position, according to its latest <a href=\"https://www.technoprobe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Half-Year-Financial-Report-as-of-30.06.2025.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">H1 2025 report</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The primary factor driving Technoprobe’s premium valuation relative to FormFactor is its larger exposure to foundry and logic probe card applications since they are less cyclical and more design-intensive compared to memory applications where FormFactor leads.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, with FormFactor in the midst of a potential multi-year HBM growth cycle and expanding its presence in foundry and logic applications, I expect it to re-rate near Technoprobe’s EV/EBIT multiple. This view can be supported by Advantest’s January 2025 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/19964457-advantest-forms-strategic-partnerships-with-formfactor-and-technoprobe\">investments</a> in both FormFactor and Technoprobe, signaling that the broader ATE market views both companies as equals.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In light of this, my target EV/adjusted EBIT multiple for FormFactor is 52.34 based on a 60% weight to Technoprobe’s multiple and a 20% weight for each of Advantest and Teradyne. This target multiple represents a 6.3% discount to Technoprobe while also representing a premium to both Advantest and Teradyne. Such a premium is justified, in my opinion, due to probe cards’ consumable nature allowing for a recurring revenue stream unlike test systems which are typically one-time purchases and largely depend on customers’ capex plans.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">By applying this target multiple to my forecasted adjusted operating margin, as a proxy to adjusted EBIT, my price target for FormFactor is $122, representing 25% upside potential from its current valuation.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Price Target</p></td></tr> <tr> <td><p>Adjusted EBIT</p></td> <td><p>$176,700,000</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>EV</p></td> <td><p>$7,353,515,319</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>EV/Adj.

The first risk worth noting regarding the Farmers Branch facility is potential delays in the ramp timeline, as any delay could leave the company capacity-constrained near the peak of the HBM4 cycle, potentially leading to the loss of sales volumes. Such delays could also increase FormFactor’s cash burn substantially this year and drain its existing $275.2 million cash balance, potentially leading it to raise capital to shore up its balance sheet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk to consider is FormFactor potentially failing to retain key personnel in California before its transition to Farmers Branch. This could lead to quality control issues or missed delivery windows for customers, which could compress gross margins and negatively impact the company’s bottom-line performance in FY 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Operational risks aside, a major risk to my thesis is a potential HBM correction. If hyperscalers’ AI capex slows down, the HBM market could enter an oversupply period, and thus, lowering demand for HBM probe cards. This could be devastating for FormFactor, especially with its ongoing investments in the Farmers Branch facility and restructuring plan, and would compress its valuation. In that case, FormFactor’s stock could fall sharply given that its high valuation multiples are already pricing in its opportunity in the HBM4 cycle.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I’m bullish on FormFactor thanks to its favorable position in the HBM4 cycle as a key probe card supplier to the three major HBM makers. Through this position, the company is set to benefit from the beginning of HBM4 mass production in the first half of 2026, after Samsung became the first to mass produce HBM4, as well as the sampling of HBM4E in the latter half of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While FormFactor appears to be operating at max capacity, management sees room for further manufacturing efficiencies to drive higher output from existing facilities ahead of its transition to Farmers Branch. Combined with potentially higher ASPs for HBM4 probe cards, I’m forecasting FormFactor’s FY 2026 revenues at $930 million and adjusted operating income at $176.6 million, representing a 19% adjusted operating margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my opinion, these results could drive a rerating near Technoprobe’s valuation multiples, especially with FormFactor’s efforts to expand into foundry and logic probe card applications, with existing traction in GPU and custom ASIC probe cards. Based on this, I’m rating FormFactor as a buy with a $122 price target, representing 25% upside potential from current levels.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TRIN\" title=\"Trinity Capital Inc.\">TRIN</a></span>) has been on my Top 3 BDC list along with Kayne Anderson BDC, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KBDC\" title=\"Kayne Anderson BDC, Inc.\">KBDC</a>) and Fidus Investment (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FDUS\" title=\"Fidus Investment\">FDUS</a>) for quite some time.</p> <p>For example, in my previous follow-up <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4840054-trinity-capital-one-of-the-best-buy-the-dip-moments-in-bdc-space\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4840054-trinity-capital-one-of-the-best-buy-the-dip-moments-in-bdc-space\" target=\"_blank\">piece</a> on TRIN, I viewed the then-current BDC<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> dip as one of the best buying opportunities in the entire BDC space. Starting from that date, TRIN is up by ~13% (on a total return basis) despite the notable sector-wide selloff that has pushed TRIN's share price lower in the past ~30-day period.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My investment case on TRIN was mostly built around these aspects:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Cheapest internally managed BDC to buy. I'm not including PhenixFIN (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFX\" title=\"PhenixFIN\">PFX</a>) in the mix for obvious (different business focus) reasons.</li> <li>Very competitive yield</li> <li>Clean earnings profile (e.g., almost no PIK)</li> <li>Robust portfolio quality</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a nutshell, it boiled down to a juicy and durable dividend case that was supported by a defensive and slowly but surely growing underlying business (or NAV).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And I have to say that it does not feel bad to be right. The recent Q4, 2025 <a href=\"https://ir.trinitycap.com/static-files/bd413a14-cf69-4e77-add9-730dccaf9735\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.trinitycap.com/static-files/bd413a14-cf69-4e77-add9-730dccaf9735\" target=\"_blank\">earnings package</a> clearly proves that TRIN is not your typical high-yielding BDC. And perhaps the best thing here is that we have once again a dip situation in front of us and, at the same time, freshly baked quarterly earnings data points that provide strong evidence of TRIN's dividend (and NAV) durability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's dive in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q4, 2025 figures, we can see that TRIN has managed to deliver an NII of $0.52 per share, which is consistent with the result achieved in the previous quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some might think that it is nothing positive and even disappointing to see stagnating performance. However, as a close and active follower of the BDC space, seeing almost every Q4 BDC earnings report that has been published so far, I can say that this kind of result is exceptional.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, I can't even name a single BDC that has produced stable NII per share results compared to the prior quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason why BDCs have registered weaker NII generation levels is mostly associated with the interest rate cuts <span>by the Fed in Q3 and Q</span>4 <span>2025</span>, where falling SOFR has compressed their NII yield profiles. Then, of course, there are select examples that have suffered non-accruals and been more exposed to spread tightening dynamics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, as I stated above, TRIN is not your typical BDC. And in this particular instance, it is the combination of the following items that has contributed to stable NII per share levels:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Expanding portfolio base without meaningful non-accrual hiccups.</li> <li>Improved spreads at the cost of debt front.</li> <li>Most importantly, unique NII interest rate sensitivity profile.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The essence of the last bullet is very nicely captured in this chart:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49926601-17720818311829045.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"NII sensativity\" width=\"608\" height=\"485\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"608\" data-height=\"485\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49926601-17720818311829045.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49926601-17720818311829045.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49926601-17720818311829045.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>TRIN Q4, 2025 earnings report</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because of favorable interest rate floor mechanics, TRIN is almost perfectly protected from lower interest rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would even say that TRIN has a chance to extract some benefit from lower base rates as it achieved interest rate savings through floating debt (leverage) facilities and pockets higher repayment fees, while the asset yield side remains largely flat. And, of course, in this context, we have to remember that TRIN holds 209 warrant positions across 130 portfolio companies, which move closer and closer in the money as the interest rate environment becomes more supportive for deal making.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, if we speak about credit quality, which has become the key question or concern for the market (mostly driven by SaaS fears), I have two important points to make here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, TRIN has one of the lowest exposures to SaaS in the BDC world. For example, in Q4 its exposure to SaaS was 9.4%, which is down from ~11% in Q3 (that was already a very low level). Meanwhile, the sector blue chips, such as Ares Capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARCC\" title=\"Ares Capital\">ARCC</a>) and Blackstone Secured Lending (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BXSL\" title=\"Blackstone Secured Lending Fund.\">BXSL</a>) have SaaS accounting for ~20% of their loan books (I'm not saying anything bad about these two names, just putting things into perspective).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The comment from management in the Q4 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874784-trinity-capital-inc-trin-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874784-trinity-capital-inc-trin-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">earnings call</a> provided an encouraging color pertaining to the SaaS issue as well:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The recent overreaction around AI's impact on the software industry is not new to us. We've been dealing with AI-driven disruption for more than 3 years and we've made thoughtful decisions to strategically diversify our portfolio and opportunistically invest in adjacent sectors to the AI space. Enterprise SaaS is currently 9% of our portfolio.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, when it comes to SaaS risk, I think that it would be fair to say again that TRIN is not your typical BDC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, the overall portfolio quality remained in solid shape. The non-accruals came in below 1% of FV. The income that could be tied to PIK stood at an industry-leading level as well (i.e., at ~2%, while the <a href=\"https://www.raymondjames.com/-/media/rj/dotcom/files/corporations-and-institutions/investment-banking/industry-insight/quarterly-bdc-market-update.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.raymondjames.com/-/media/rj/dotcom/files/corporations-and-institutions/investment-banking/industry-insight/quarterly-bdc-market-update.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">sector average</a>, at least based on Q3 data, was 7.9%). These dynamics also go hand in hand with the fact that about 85% of total loan investment principal for TRIN is secured by first liens on the enterprise value equipment, and for enterprise backed loans, the weighted average loan-to-value is just 17%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bottom line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on the current P/NAV statistics, where TRIN trades at 1.14x, this BDC still remains as the cheapest internally managed vehicle. And this is despite very robust Q4 earnings figures with a unique earnings and credit quality profile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given TRIN's $1.2 billion investment pipeline going into Q1 2026, access to accretive equity finance via NAV issuances, and expanding fee-generating asset management platforms (which are also a source of cheap capital), I would certainly expect durable NII per share results. The interest rate risk isolated earnings profile comes in handy as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my humble opinion, the Q4 report once again proves that TRIN is not your typical BDC. The interest rate protection mechanism is unique; the credit and earnings quality falls certainly within the top decile, and the fact that it is an internally managed BDC is also a significant (and rare) advantage that provides a strong valuation support (which is good for accretive equity issuances to support sustainable portfolio growth).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TRIN remains on my Top 3 BDC list.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

This represents an upgrade by the global index provider from frontier to emerging market status.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong growth combined with a recognition of its recent capital market reforms in the form of index inclusion means that Vietnam's stock market has gained increased attention from global investors. But, with the vast majority of Vietnamese stocks listed locally and some completely restricted from foreign investment at the individual stock level, Vietnam's stock market can be difficult to access. Even if one can access the market, stock selection can be a challenge for new investors because, as an emerging market, Vietnam's stock market lacks the breadth and depth of sectors seen in more developed stock markets, such as China's.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What are some of the benefits of Vietnam ETFs?</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vietnam ETFs can provide diversified exposure to Vietnam's stock market in a single investment that trades on a US exchange.* However, the <a href=\"https://kraneshares.com/etf/kpho\" rel=\"nofollow\">KraneShares Dragon Capital Vietnam Growth Index ETF</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KPHO\" title=\"KraneShares Dragon Capital Vietnam Growth Idx ETF\">KPHO</a>), through ownership of Dragon Capital's locally-listed product, the Diamond ETF, KPHO provides access to the stocks that reached or are nearing their Foreign Ownership Limits. KPHO also employs an index-based fundamental screen based on specified ranges of price-to-earnings (P/E) and asset-to-equity ratios, as well as a proprietary growth ratio calculated by the index provider, to select eligible securities.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What is the outlook for Vietnam's stock market?</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As investors are looking for opportunities outside the United States and especially within emerging markets, amid a declining US dollar, Vietnam looks compelling. As of February 11, 2026, the average P/E ratio among KPHO's underlying holdings was only 9.7 compared to 17.2 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. At the same time, Dragon Capital, the fund's sub-advisor, expects net profit growth of 16% to 18% in 2026, which is in line with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.<sup>2</sup></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What are KPHO's top 10 holdings and how do they contribute to Vietnam's growth story?</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">KPHO's current top 10 holdings span financial services, manufacturing, retail, technology, logistics, and real estate. These are all key components of Vietnam's current growth story, which is primarily driven by manufacturing for export, rising incomes and spending, and lending to support these development areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_image-3_1.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Vietnam ETF: 10 Stocks Investors Should Get To Know\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_image-3_1.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_image-3_1.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_image-3_1.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_image-3_1.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_image-3_1.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below, we provide a brief description of each of KPHO's top ten holdings, accompanied by financial and operational highlights from 2025.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">KPHO Top 10 Holding Profile &amp; 2025 Earnings Update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Data from Dragon Capital, KraneShares, company releases &amp; filings as of 12/31/2025. % changes are year-over-year (YoY) unless otherwise indicated.</em> <em>Figures may be adjusted (non-GAAP).</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Hoa Phat Group</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hoa Phat is an industrial manufacturing group in Vietnam that started out as a construction machine and equipment trading company and gradually expanded its operations to include the production of steel, steel pipes, and agricultural products. It also supplies materials for infrastructure projects such as airports and high-speed rail, which are important for Vietnam's current stage of development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Hoa Phat Group By The Numbers (2025):</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +12.4% to $6.0 billion</li> <li>Net Income +28.5% to $0.6 billion</li> <li>Net Margin 9.9%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.04</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hoa Phat managed a solid earnings recovery in 2025, supported by higher steel volumes on improved domestic demand compared to 2024. Although fourth quarter net profit rose 38%, results were temporarily weighed down by approximately $34.2 million in depreciation and interest expenses following the early capitalization of a second blast furnace at a key steel plant. Steel continued to dominate revenues, accounting for 94% of fourth quarter sales. Despite short-term cost pressures, operating leverage improved as capacity utilization normalised throughout the year.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Vietnam Prosperity (VP) Bank</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VP Bank is one of Vietnam’s largest private-sector banks by assets, operating a diversified platform across retail banking, corporate lending, consumer finance, securities, and insurance. The bank has continued to expand its scale and deepen its ecosystem, supported by a focus on digitalization and fee-based income alongside its core lending activities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>VP Bank by The Numbers (2025):</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +19.9% to $2.9 billion</li> <li>Net Income +52.0% to $0.9 billion</li> <li>Net Interest Margin 5.4%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.12</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VP Bank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VUPPF\" title=\"VP Bank AG\">VUPPF</a>) reported improved profitability in 2025. In the fourth quarter, profit before tax rose 43% and net profit rose 43% and net profit rose 72%, reflecting improved operating and bottom-line results. Overall lending growth in the consumer and corporate segments was 35% in the fourth quarter, driven by both the parent bank and improving contributions from subsidiaries FE Credit and VP Bank Securities. Asset quality improved as non-performing loans (NPLs) were reduced to nearly 3%. Meanwhile, cost discipline kept the cost-to-income ratio at near 24%. Strong fee income, bad-debt recoveries, and subsidiary earnings also reinforced the bank’s recovery momentum in 2025.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sacombank</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sacombank is another key private-sector bank in Vietnam. The bank currently operates 560 branches not only in Vietnam, but also in Laos and Cambodia. Sacombank focuses on retail lending (mortgages, auto loans, etc.) and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) lending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Sacombank by The Numbers (2025)</em>:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +11.8% to $1.2 billion</li> <li>Net Income $0.2 billion</li> <li>Net Interest Margin 3.2%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.12</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sacombank recorded a +4% increase in operating income in the fourth quarter. Although the bank's net interest income declined, Sacombank still managed to increase its revenue and net income thanks to a 42% reduction in operating expenses. The bank still recorded a loss of $106 million in the fourth quarter due to a sharp jump in provisioning expenses of $355 million.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Vietcombank</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Originating as a specialized bank serving the country’s external economic activities, Vietcombank has evolved into a full-service, multi-functional financial institution. Today, it operates across a wide range of sectors, offering top-tier services in international trade and traditional banking activities such as capital management, fund mobilization, credit provision, and project financing, as well as modern banking services, including foreign exchange, derivatives, card services, and electronic banking. With a market capitalization of more than $20 billion, Vietcombank now ranks among the world’s 100 largest listed banks. Vietcombank operates an extensive network of more than 600 branches, 3,090 ATMs, 121,035 card payment acceptance units nationwide and 24,000 employees.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Vietcombank By The Numbers (2025):</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +27.4% to $0.4 billion</li> <li>Net Income +4.0% to $0.2 billion</li> <li>Net Interest Margin 2.7%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.09</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2025 results were mostly in line with the market’s expectations. Vietcombank's credit growth was 15%, compared to Vietnam's overall credit growth, which was reported at 19%. Vietcombank's growth was driven slightly more by retail credit compared to corporate. Consumer credit increased by +18.5% versus only 13% for corporate credit. Net interest margin improved slightly in the fourth quarter, while its ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) remains low compared to the industry average in Vietnam, at just 0.6%.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>HD Bank</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Established in 1990, HD Bank provides a wide array of financial and banking services to individuals, businesses and investors. The bank has a network of 347 banking transaction points and 22,921 financial transaction points, serving over 30 million customers in its ecosystem, including airlines, supermarkets, telecommunications firms. Recently, HD Bank has focused on a strong digital transformation strategy across operations and client-facing activities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>HD Bank by The Numbers (2025):</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +25.4% to $1.6 billion</li> <li>Net Income +29.3% to $0.6 billion</li> <li>Net Interest Margin 4.4%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.13</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">HD Bank's net profit after taxes &amp; minority interests (NPATMI) increased 64% to $200 million in the fourth quarter. Asset quality improved, lowering the number of NPLs as a percentage of total loans outstanding, and the growth of current accounts and savings accounts (CASAs) recovered to 12.4% from the 10% exhibited in the previous quarter. Credit grew by 31% YoY and 13% quarter-over-quarter thanks to strong corporate loan growth of 34% YoY and despite modest retail loan growth of 5% YoY.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>FPT Corporation</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FPT is a pioneer in Vietnam's digital transformation and a leader in IT consulting services, providing and deploying technology and telecommunications services and solutions. With 38 years of history, presence in 30 countries and almost 50,000 employees, FPT is the largest listed technology company in Vietnam.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>FPT Corporation by the numbers (2025):</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +11.6% to $2.7 billion</li> <li>Net Income +19.3% to $0.4 billion</li> <li>Net Margin 16.0%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.20</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Core IT services revenue increased +21% in the fourth quarter on increasing domestic and global demand for IT services. Meanwhile, the telecom segment exhibited slower growth of +9%, but saw better cost management and, as a result, improved profitability.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Gemadept</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gemadept is a large private port operator in Vietnam, owning ports nationwide across North, South and Central Vietnam. The Gemalink Deep-sea Port is ranked among the 19 ports in the world capable of receiving the largest vessels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Gemadept by the numbers (2025):</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +23.1% to $0.2 billion</li> <li>Net Income +15.2% to $0.7 billion</li> <li>Net Margin 27.4%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.14</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fourth quarter revenue increased 14.4% to $62 million, adding to total revenue of $230 million in 2025. Revenue from ports rose 12%, accounting for 89% of total sales, as logistics and other business lines revenue increased 35%. Total cargo volume recorded as having been handled by Gemdept's ports increased 17% to 3.1 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). The gross margin for 2025 improved to 46% from 44% in 2024.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Vinhomes</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vinhomes, a large residential property developer in Vietnam by market capitalization, had recorded $37 billion in cumulative contracted sales since 2010 as of October 2025, with presales outstanding of 285,700 residential units, approximately 517,000 residents across its properties nationwide, and 30 urban complexes developed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Vinhomes By The Numbers (2025):</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +50.6% to $5.9B</li> <li>Net Income +29.3% to $1.6B</li> <li>Net Margin 27.3%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.06</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vinhomes delivered solid sales growth of +218% in the fourth quarter, booking $3.9 billion in net sales thanks to bulk sales at Vinhomes Green Paradise, unit deliveries at Ocean Park 2 &amp; 3, and further sales at Vinhomes Royal Island. Fourth quarter net profit after tax and minority interests (NPATMI) rose +119.8% to $1 billion, while presales remain strong at $1.7 billion with contributions from Ocean Park 2, Golden City, Wonder City and other projects. Unbilled presales in Vinhomes Wonder City, Golden City, Ocean Park 2, Royal Island and Green City totalled $7.2 billion and are expected to be converted into revenues when the units are delivered.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mobile World Group (MWG)</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MWG is Vietnam’s leading multi-category retail platform by revenue and net income. The company operates thousands of stores nationwide across multiple chains which include thegioididong.com (a retail chain for mobile phones, laptops and accessories), Điện Máy Xanh (a consumer electronics retail chain) and Bách Hoá Xanh (chain of 2,559 modern groceries retail stores), among others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MWG directly benefits from a clear structural shift underway from traditional trade toward modern retail formats, i.e., developed world-style supermarkets as opposed to open-air, multi-vendor markets. Modern trade penetration has increased from approximately 20% of total retail value in 2019 to around 27% in 2024, reflecting steady migration toward organized channels. This transition has been particularly evident in essential categories. In grocery retail, modern trade penetration rose from 9% to 13% over the same period, as consumers prioritized convenience, consistent product quality, and price transparency. At the same time, the growing importance of scale and logistics efficiency has reinforced the competitive advantages of organised retailers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Mobile World by the numbers (2025)</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +16.5% to $6.0B</li> <li>Net Income +89.1% to $0.3B</li> <li>Net Margin 4.5%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.01</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MWG exceeded profit expectations in the fourth quarter. DMX, which is a subsidiary consumer electronics chain, contributes 43.8% to total revenue, followed by BHX (grocery stores) at 30% and thegioididong (mobile phone stores) at 23.9%. After a period of restructuring, BHX saw 789 new stores opened in 2025, all of which have delivered positive operating profits and nearly 70% of the stores recorded positive EBIT. For 2026, MWG set target of +18% YoY growth in revenue and +30% growth in net profits.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Nam A Commercial Bank</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nam A Commercial Bank (NAB) officially commenced operations on October 21, 1992, and was one of the first commercial joint-stock banks established after the Banking Ordinance was issued in 1990, which effectively allowed the development of a private banking system. NAB currently offers almost 280 transaction centres and employs more than 5,300 personnel. In 2025, NAB was included in the Southeast Asia 500 list by Fortune Magazine.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Nam A Commercial Bank by the numbers (2025):</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +27.4% to $0.4B</li> <li>Net Income +15.9% to $0.2B</li> <li>Net Interest Margin 2.7%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.09</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NAB posted +57% top line growth for 2025 at $152 million, concluding the year with revenue growth of +27% to $444 million. NPATMI for the whole year saw growth of +16%, reaching $161 million in 2025. NAB reported a decrease in NPLs in the fourth quarter, down to 2% from 3% in the previous quarter. The NPL ratio for 2025 is at 2.2%, a slight improvement from 2.3% in 2024. CASA was at the highest level for 2025 in the fourth quarter at 6.1%. However, the CASA remained lower than the 6.6% reported in 2024.</p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">*Diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against a loss.

This figure is sometimes called the “bottom line” because it shows the final profit attributable to shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Revenue growth</strong>: The percentage change in a company’s revenue from one period to the next. It is typically calculated as (current period revenue−prior period revenue)/prior period revenue (current period revenue−prior period revenue)/prior period revenue and measures how quickly sales are expanding or contracting over time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>EPS (earnings per share)</strong>: A profitability metric calculated by dividing a company’s net income attributable to common shareholders by the weighted‑average number of common shares outstanding over a period. It indicates how much profit the company generates for each individual share of stock.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Cost-to-Income Ratio:</strong> A key financial metric measuring operational efficiency, calculated by dividing a company's operating costs by its operating income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://kraneshares.com/vietnam-etf-10-stocks-investors-should-get-to-know/\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener noopener\">Original Post</a></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The forward projected EV to EBITDA number of 10.6x and sales of 0.51x (into the middle of calendar 2026) are quite the bargain vs. 2024's equivalent peaks of 40x and 4.5x \"forward\" estimates. All told, if analyst projections hold true, the enterprise valuation stats may point to lower-than-typical underlying ratios on operating results for owners, going back to 2010.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/17314402-17721109349407043.png?io=w640\" alt=\"YCharts - Super Micro Computer, Enterprise Valuation Analysis, Since 2010\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCharts - Super Micro Computer, Enterprise Valuation Analysis, Since 2010, Recession Shaded</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, Seeking Alpha now ranks SMCI with an overall \"A-\" <em>Quant Factor Valuation Grade</em> vs. historical trading ratios and peer AI computer manufacturers currently. The datapoint I like the most is the forward PEG ratio (price to earnings divided by earnings growth rate) of just 0.47x vs. a sector-wide average of 1.4x. Assuming AI buildout rates do not crash and burn in a recession soon, acquiring any asset in the industry with a PEG well under 1.0x (considered strong buy territory historically on Wall Street) should work out well for investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/17314402-17720624894308467_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1140\" data-height=\"1180\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/17314402-17720624894308467_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMCI/valuation/metrics\" width=\"640\" height=\"662\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"662\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/17314402-17720624894308467_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/17314402-17720624894308467_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/17314402-17720624894308467_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/17314402-17720624894308467_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha Table - Super Micro Computer, Quant Valuation Grades, February 24th, 2026</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Timing The Buy Trade</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, if Super Micro is sitting on a sound valuation with well above average growth prospects, when should an investor acquire a stake? Honestly, today (ASAP) would be a good answer without knowing anything about technical analysis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, the chart pattern of low volatility and a tight price range in recent months is a positive sign SMCI's quote is turning the corner and preparing to rise again. In fact, a variety of momentum indicators have been moving higher in unison for the first time since October.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Relative strength vs. the S&amp;P 500 index, the <em>Accumulation/Distribution Line</em>, and <em>On Balance Volume</em> are now each above their respective 50-day moving averages (boxed in gold below). Eight times out of ten, this condition exists when price is trending higher, in nearly any equity you research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A price breakout in coming days to new multi-month highs (above $35) would seem to confirm a new up leg has begun for shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/17314402-1772109850316475_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"633\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/17314402-1772109850316475_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"StockCharts.com - Super Micro Computer, 18 Months of Daily Price &amp; Volume, Author Reference\" width=\"640\" height=\"477\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/17314402-1772109850316475_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/17314402-1772109850316475_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/17314402-1772109850316475_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/17314402-1772109850316475_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>StockCharts.com - Super Micro Computer, 18 Months of Daily Price &amp; Volume, Author Reference</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Super Micro Computer has been one of (if not the) worst performer for investors in the AI hardware space since March 2024's share quote peak. The stock's -68% price change is matched against advances of +100% or better in many peers. My thinking is 2026 may produce the opposite for trends, namely a material gain for SMCI vs. flat to lower pricing in the sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/17314402-1772067157772846.png?io=w640\" alt=\"YCharts - Super Micro Computer vs. AI Hardware/Hyperscaler Peers, Price Change, Since March 2024\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCharts - Super Micro Computer vs. AI Hardware Peers, Price Change, Since March 2024</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Don't say it cannot happen. The valuation for Super Micro has moved from one of the most expensive to the cheapest in the industry, over the last two years. Really, only <strong>Hewlett-Packard</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPQ\" title=\"HP Inc.\">HPQ</a>) may have a lower valuation regime today in its competitor grouping. However, HP is mainly focused on slower-growth consumer products, holding way too much debt. So, a countertrend SMCI rally in the face of selling elsewhere is entirely possible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/17314402-17720675722761755.png?io=w640\" alt=\"YCharts - Super Micro Computer vs. AI Hardware Peers, Forward 1-Year P/E Est., Since March 2024\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCharts - Super Micro Computer vs. AI Hardware Peers, Forward 1-Year P/E Est., Since March 2024</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For contrarians, pure value investors, and growth-focused capital allocators (PEG and GARP players), Super Micro makes an excellent choice today for purchase. Plus, in terms of timing your buy, technical upside momentum has been building in February.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have a $50-60 SMCI price target range into early 2027 (for a 12-month outlook). Nothing spectacular for gains, but such a result (of +50% to +85% for a total return) could be award winning if most AI hardware names are flat to lower over the same span. Effectively, this move would simply be a retest of October's high trade above $59. At $60, SMCI would trade closer to its 10-year and 5-year average P/E multiple around 20x (estimated EPS approaching $3 in 12 months), and a forward PEG calculation above 1.0x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What are the investment risks? Downside (or limited upside) may result if the Big Tech boom turns to bust this year, particularly regarding stock market popularity with investors and share pricing. Plus, a recession could force hyperscalers and cloud providers to actually cut spending and cancel contracts for new data center hardware. Under either scenario, I suspect Super Micro Computer would trade closer to tangible book value, where 1.5x for a multiple has been considered incredibly cheap over the decades. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/17314402-17721120544927385.png?io=w640\" alt=\"YCharts - Super Micro Computer, Price to Tangible Book Value, Since 2010, Recession Shaded\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCharts - Super Micro Computer, Price to Tangible BV, Since 2010, Recession Shaded</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With tangible book value of $11.67 per share, potentially rising to $14 over the next 12-18 months, my modeling of a blowup bottom would be around $20 into 2027, using a long-term 1.5x tangible BV ratio. So, the $18 low quote in November 2024 should hold in a major bearish drawdown this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given upside potential to $60 vs. downside to $20, I feel the rewards are starting to smartly outweigh the risks in the low-$30s for a purchase price. I rate Super Micro Computer a <em>Buy</em> and have been building a position over the past week.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Thanks for reading.
