In simple terms, Meta had accumulated billions of dollars' worth of future tax deductions on its books, but under the new CAMT system, which calculates taxes based on financial statement income rather than regular taxable income, many of these deferred tax assets became less valuable or unusable. Accounting rules <a href=\"https://www.accountingtools.com/articles/deferred-tax-asset-valuation-allowance.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">require</a> companies to immediately write down deferred tax assets when it's more likely than not they won't be fully realized, so Meta had to take the $15.93 billion charge against earnings in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More concerning than the tax charge is how fast Meta escalates its AI spending. The company raised its 2025 capital expenditure guidance to $70-72 billion, up from a previous range of $66-72 billion. To put this in perspective, Meta's capex in 2024 was just $24.3 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49396430-1761855394894297_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1193\" data-height=\"765\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49396430-1761855394894297_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Meta's Capital Expenditures\" width=\"640\" height=\"410\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49396430-1761855394894297_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49396430-1761855394894297_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49396430-1761855394894297_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49396430-1761855394894297_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49396430-1761855394894297_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49396430-1761855394894297_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49396430-1761855394894297_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/49396430-1761855394894297_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Meta</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The increased capex will be directed primarily toward AI infrastructure as Meta chases what CEO Mark Zuckerberg calls \"personal superintelligence.\" As vague as it sounds, Meta clearly lacks a solid vision of how to effectively allocate the ever-increasing capex.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meta's AI Strategy: Too Many Issues Right Now</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">CFO Susan Li <a href=\"https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/META-Q3-2025-Follow-Up-Call-Transcript.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">indicated</a> that expenses in 2026 will grow \"significantly faster\" than in 2025.

When Google builds AI capacity, it can sell that through Google Cloud to enterprise customers. When Amazon invests in AI, it has AWS as a revenue stream. Meta's only path to profitability at this point is to improve its own advertising and social products, which makes the investment much more risky.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the meantime, Meta's <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/meta-defends-llama-4-release-against-reports-of-mixed-quality-blames-bugs\" rel=\"nofollow\">rollout</a> of its Llama 4 AI models in April 2025 was a complete mess. The latest Meta's AI models perform poorly, and the company was accused of <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/08/meta_llama4_cheating/\" rel=\"noopener\">manipulating</a> the benchmarks. Half a year later, Meta hasn't announced any meaningful updates to its models, while competitors release updated AI models every several months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The organizational instability that became apparent throughout 2025 also looks concerning. The company reorganized its AI teams multiple times this year, which suggests that management doesn't have a clear vision for how to structure these efforts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In May 2025, Meta <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/27/meta-ai-restructure-2025-agi-llama\" rel=\"nofollow\">restructured</a> its AI teams into two main units: an AI products team headed by Connor Hayes, and an AGI Foundations unit co-led by Ahmad Al-Dahle and Amir Frenkel. The split was supposed to speed up product development and give the organization more flexibility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Then, in August, just three months later, Meta <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-19/meta-restructures-ai-group-again-in-pursuit-of-superintelligence\" rel=\"nofollow\">created</a> a new organization called Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL), with a key team under the name of TBD Labs run by Alexandr Wang that would focus on foundation models like the Llama series.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reorganization was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/technology/mark-zuckerberg-meta-ai.ht\" rel=\"nofollow\">described</a> by insiders as the largest restructuring to date in Meta's AI division. However, when a company restructures every few weeks, that signals a lot of confusion at the top about strategy and execution, in my view.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To make things worse, Meta has recently <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/alexandr-wang-meta-superintelligence-labs-layoffs-memo-2025-10\" rel=\"nofollow\">laid</a> off 600 employees in its newly created Meta Superintelligence Labs division. Thus, Meta is stuck with inferior AI models and a smaller AI team facing regular corporate reorganizations to handle the existing issues.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There's another problem with the company's plan to \"front-load building capacity\": a potential lack of available hardware. OpenAI has already <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/openai-nvidia-systems-partnership/\" rel=\"nofollow\">engaged</a> in <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/amd-signs-ai-chip-supply-deal-with-openai-gives-it-option-take-10-stake-2025-10-06\" rel=\"nofollow\">partnerships</a> with both Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>) and AMD (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) to ensure it gets as much AI hardware as possible in the foreseeable future. In a hypothetical positive scenario with AI adoption aggressively rising, Meta <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-08/the-circular-openai-nvidia-and-amd-deals-raising-fears-of-a-new-tech-bubble\" rel=\"nofollow\">won't</a> be a priority customer for hardware companies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, Meta may lose in both scenarios. If AI adoption is successful and massive, Meta may struggle to obtain all the necessary hardware at a reasonable price. If AI adoption happens to be slower than expected, Meta may waste hundreds of billions of dollars with poor return on investment.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The advertising business is strong enough to support the current valuation at around 26x forward earnings, but more evidence is needed that the massive AI investments will actually generate meaningful returns. The company needs to demonstrate that Llama 4 and future models can compete effectively with rivals like GPT and Claude, that the organizational structure can finally stabilize, and that there's a clear path from $100+ billion AI spending to improved financial results and higher profitability.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Until these aspects get addressed with actual data and results, the risk/reward profile for Meta stock looks okay at best, in my opinion. The stock isn't extremely expensive, but the execution risks around the AI strategy are significant and shouldn't be ignored.</p>",

Since their introduction in May 2000, the iShares ETFs have supplied a bounty of data about the performance record of ETFs. It's not what people expected. We'll get to that in a couple of paragraphs.</p> <p>Although the SPDR S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>), (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Futures\">SPX</a>) dates to 1993, in 2000 it was still a rounding error within the equity market. All 80 ETFs that existed that year totaled about $65 billion, <sup>1 </sup>a mere 0.4% of the U.S. stock market. <sup>2 </sup>By year-end 2023 assets in passive funds finally exceeded those in active funds; lately, to pick a single ETF <em>totally </em>at random, the iShares Bitcoin (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BTC-USD\" title=\"Bitcoin USD\">BTC-USD</a>) Trust ETF alone is close to $90 billion. <sup>3</sup></p> <p>The ETF era began in earnest that year, with a continuously and massively expanding annual inflow of funds, in particular drawn from active managers. The 2000 to 2025 ETF record is every bit as important as the seminal Ibbotson and Sinquefield study of asset returns from 1929 to 1975. <sup>4 </sup>It is a question-raising counterpart to accepted wisdom and asset allocation practices.</p> <p>Ibbotson and Sinquefield introduced the expectation that stocks should return 10% or more annually over time. Yet, in the past 25 years—across the spectrum of large and small cap sectors, growth and value, domestic and international—with virtually no exceptions, annualized equity ETF returns were in the <strong>7% to 8% range </strong>. Fixed-income ETFs—across the maturity spectrum and even for inflation-indexed investment grade bonds— <strong>returned 3.5% and below </strong>; adjusted for taxes and inflation, they were <strong>negative </strong>.</p> <p>That return shortfall is all the more surprising—and should be worrisome—given the massive one-decade lift from the Information Technology sector which, inclusive of Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), Meta and Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>), now comprises 46.1% <sup>5 </sup>of the S&amp;P 500 market value. One person's worry can differ from someone else's.</p> <p>Most investors worry, as expressed in the valuations, about the <em>opportunity </em>cost of missing outperformance in the IT sector—now synonymous with the AI/datacenter phenomenon. Few worry about the virtually inevitable <em>capital loss </em>cost of participating: with IT's index dominance, there's nowhere to hide, no saving diversification grace to be had, should IT valuations contract if/when any of a range identifiable emerging risks make themselves felt. All such episodes of market concentration and valuation extremes end similarly.</p> <figure contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618651469464557.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Line chart showing the performance of iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW-US) and S&amp;P 500 (&lt;span&gt;SP500&lt;/span&gt;) from October 2015 to October 2024.

Some might argue that this is a selection date convenience that invalidates the conclusions. That argument ignores the extraordinary expansion in revenues and valuation multiples that has fueled the current market. Because now it's a peak to peak measurement. In any case, May 2000 also—and this is the very point—coincides with the inception of the ETF era and its supportive impacts.</p> <p>It can also be asked, “Is 25 years not ‘long term’ enough that the IT sector, in particular, must still be accorded special deference?” For instance, at the Dot.com Bubble peak, Technology represented almost exactly one-third of the S&amp;P 500 by weight. <sup>6 </sup>The remainder of the index had rather low valuations—it’s not clear at all that the year-2000 starting point for long-term stock market performance is unfairly maligned by the Dot.com bubble. On a weighting basis, the IT sector was well exceeded by Health Care, Consumer Staples, Consumer Discretionary, and Financials. At that peak, the Consumer Staples forward P/E was below 15, and Financials were about 12.5. <sup>7</sup></p> <p>For a sharper compare-and-contrast, a generous selection of large-capitalization growth companies in late 1999, ranging from the likes of Abbott Labs (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABT\" title=\"Abbott Laboratories\">ABT</a>) and The Hershey Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HSY\" title=\"The Hershey Company\">HSY</a>) to M&amp;T Bank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MTB\" title=\"M&amp;T Bank Corporation\">MTB</a>) had an average ROE of 25%, about the same as a selection of Technology companies like Intel (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INTC\" title=\"Intel Corporation\">INTC</a>), Microsoft, and Oracle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>).</p> <p>Yet, while the trailing 12-month stock performance of the Technology stocks averaged 166% (yes, indeed), the aforementioned blue-chip economic super-performers’ average return was negative—to be exact, -15%.</p> <p>The year-forward average P/E of the Technology companies was 122x earnings, while the estimated P/E for these “normal” stocks—not normal, actually, in terms of their extraordinarily high returns on equity—was 15.7x earnings.</p> <h4>Market Concentration Then and Now:The Antediluvian Era of ETF Indexation vs. Today</h4> <div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th>Positions</th> <th>% of S&amp;P 500 Total Market CapitalizationAt Sept. 1988</th> <th>% of S&amp;P 500 Total Market CapitalizationAt Oct. 9, 2025</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Positions</td> <td>At Sept. 1988</td> <td>At Oct. 9, 2025</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Top 10</td> <td>18.0%</td> <td>38.9%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Top 20</td> <td>26.8%</td> <td>48.2%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Top 25</td> <td>30.5%</td> <td>51.5%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>#25 Constituent</td> <td>Procter &amp; Gamble (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PG\" title=\"The Procter &amp; Gamble Company\">PG</a>)</td> <td>Procter &amp; Gamble</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Top 50</td> <td>45.0%</td> <td>61.9%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>\n<span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button>\n</div> <h4>S&amp;P 500: Some Sector Weight Changes on the 25th Anniversary of the ETF Indexation Era</h4> <div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th></th> <th>% of S&amp;P 500Total Market CapOct 1990</th> <th>1990E P/E</th> <th>% of S&amp;P 500Total Market Cap10/16/2025</th> <th>2025E P/E</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Energy</td> <td>14.8%</td> <td>13.9</td> <td>2.8%</td> <td>16.7</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Info.

That two-sides-of-the-coin result in the stock performance of these two groups was created by the suction pump effect of the bubble market pulling money out of the “blue chips” into the dot.coms. The notion that the stock market can reliably generate 10% annualized returns should not be accorded any special protection from objective evaluation.</p> <p>In deference to the World Series, now in full swing, this Commentary’s major points will be organized rather like a baseball lineup.</p> <h3>First Batter Up: Sidestepping the Index by Investing with the House...Securities Exchanges</h3> <p>Part I, last quarter, introduced the idea of sidestepping the index entirely, yet with a rational, fact-based expectation of a higher-than-index long-term return. Also the idea that there’s more than one way to do this. The academic literature about efficient markets and modern portfolio theory—and the ever-burgeoning indexation movement—asserts that this scenario shouldn’t exist.</p> <p>That it <em>can </em>exist is in part an effect of the market impact of the index investment vehicles themselves. Originally intended to measure market performance, with the idea of participating in a very modest way that doesn’t alter that which is being measured, indexed investing has become “the market” and the marginal trade. When such a great portion of the finite volume of investment funds that is available at any given time flows into one gravitational vortex of the market—in this era, the mega-cap and IT stocks—there must necessarily be an investments funds volume deficit elsewhere, the shallows well away from the deep, crowded pool of the efficient marketplace. Many such areas, in fact, where valuations are distorted downward instead of upward.</p> <p><strong>Securities Exchanges </strong>, as prefaced last quarter, are the most conceptually familiar of these alternative, contra-index equity classes. As the venues where transactions take place, they sit, like a croupier at a casino, atop the market action, ultimately indifferent to the fashions and tempests of the moment. All the while, they collect their spreads and benefit from periodic volatility as well as long-term rising volumes.</p> <p>Herewith, a review by the manager of our Blockchain Development ETF (actively managed, of course), Brandon Colavita. You should note, in this section, another paradox around scarcity value: although the four major incumbent securities exchanges operationally encompass the totality of the stock market, they themselves comprise only a 0.4% aggregate weight in the S&amp;P 500. As with other strategies we employ that have an implicit inflation hedge character, there is precious little of it available to an index buyer.</p> <hr> <p>The securities exchange model is so powerful that nearly every exchange with a 20-year public track record has outperformed its respective regional stock index, in most cases by a wide margin. It’s a global phenomenon: The U.S., Japan, Hong Kong, the UK, Singapore, you can see the list in the accompanying schedule. The business model provides global exposure to a wide variety of assets, many of them either absent from—or only marginally available in—the indexes themselves. It allows them to maintain their favorable financial characteristics regardless of where it is implemented, regardless of the economic variables of each specific region.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th>As of September 30, 2025 – 20-Year TR (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USD\" title=\"ProShares Ultra Semiconductors ETF\">USD</a>)</th> <th>Cumulative</th> <th>Annualized</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>CME Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CME\" title=\"CME Group Inc.\">CME</a>) Inc</td> <td>692%</td> <td>10.90%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>S&amp;P 500 Total Return Index</td> <td>702%</td> <td>10.97%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Excess</strong></td> <td><strong>-9%</strong></td> <td><strong>-0.06%</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Nasdaq (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NDAQ\" title=\"Nasdaq, Inc.\">NDAQ</a>) Inc</td> <td>1208%</td> <td>13.72%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>S&amp;P 500 Total Return Index</td> <td>702%</td> <td>10.97%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Excess</strong></td> <td><strong>506%</strong></td> <td><strong>2.75%</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Japan Exchange Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/JPXGY\" title=\"Japan Exchange Group, Inc.\">OTCPK:JPXGY</a>) Inc</td> <td>2131%</td> <td>16.79%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Topix Total Return Index JPY</td> <td>160%</td> <td>4.90%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Excess</strong></td> <td><strong>1970%</strong></td> <td><strong>11.90%</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Hong Kong Exchanges &amp;

Current exposures of our strategies are not just a function of initial allocations, but of the performance of the individual securities we hold. As long as conviction in a position remains, it is allowed to compound without the impediments—the decision risks, taxes and friction—of trading.</p> <p>In this way many of our portfolios manifest a natural trend towards concentration. With time, the best performing companies have become some of the most influential positions, while lesser performing securities have self-limited their impact.</p> <p>Not every idea will have the same level of success. But we are confident in comprehensive fundamental research that incorporates and reconciles the quantitative with the qualitative. That means the business model, not merely the financial metrics; market and index structure, not merely weightings, arbitrary sector designations and volatility stats; the long-term economic and competitive context over short-term index-relative returns. Enough so to let each thesis play out uninterrupted. While the strategy exhibits low turnover, the underlying holdings are constantly evaluated, since research analysis—not passion—is what dictates changes.</p> <p>There is no little irony that—as long-term investors who espouse and practice minimal turnover—a central theme and allocation is the securities exchange business model, which depends upon monetizing the financial markets’ ever-increasing turnover and trading. Of course, exchanges are capturing other parties’ needs to transact; their own business, while adaptive to new trading instruments and sources of volume, is highly persistent. CME was founded as the Chicago Butter and Egg Board in 1898; today, their largest contracts are interest rate futures, while some of their fastest growing are related to cryptocurrencies.</p> <p>This inherent adaptability— <em>growing with </em>, not despite, the introduction of new, “disruptive” assets and trading methods—has been a feature of the securities exchanges for as long as the available data show, and they have about the greatest longevity of any publicly traded business in the world. The NYSE dates to May 17, 1792, and the London Stock Exchange’s history goes back to 1698 in the venue of Jonathan’s Coffee House.</p> <p>Since 1957, when the S&amp;P 500 was established, creative destruction has ravaged, merged or replaced half of the original companies. <sup>8 </sup>By 2003, of the 341 surviving descendants (including products of mergers and spin-offs); 41 were foreign companies; 11 were in the process of bankruptcy proceedings; another 119 are no longer in the S&amp;P 500; 63 were taken private. And that was two decades ago. As to the original Dow (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DOW\" title=\"Dow Inc.\">DOW</a>) Jones members...today they’re hardly recognizable, like Distilling &amp; Cattle Feeding. <sup>9</sup></p> <p>While constant trading is the antithesis of our portfolio management practice, that is decidedly not the investment world’s preference. There is no reason to believe that human psychology will change or that markets will cease to innovate, so in this sense our portfolios benefit from the ever increasing transaction volume and velocity.</p> <p><strong>Figure 2: Composition of Original S&amp;P 500 firms on December 31, 2003.</strong></p> <figure contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-1761865146976997.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"The diagram shows the composition of the Original S&amp;P 500 (3/1/1957, 500 firms) and its descendants: Original S&amp;P 500 (500 firms) branches into: Survivors Portfolio (125), Merged Firms (92), and Private Firms (74).

The SPDR, even with $600 billion of assets, trades $44 billion worth of its shares daily, which means 100% turnover every 14 days.</li> <li>In some cases, trading hours have increased, markets have gone electronic, platforms have introduced low-latency matching engines (sub-20-millionths-of-a-second transaction speed for some platforms). The list of adaptive developments goes on.</li> </ul> <p>But all of these are operational details of adjusting to the moment or an era; they are necessary to any going concern, but don't really explain why exchanges are so different than other businesses. Exchanges are where businesses go, where the world goes, to lay off risk and hedge, to raise capital, to buy and sell securely and with transparency, where there is the presence and availability of all the other buyers and sellers and the liquidity afforded by their joint presence in the same place. It's the venue, the (regulated) bazaar, that allows our capital markets to operate.</p> <p>Another reason for the extraordinary performance of exchanges aligns perfectly with our portfolio management philosophy: it is the incredible ability of these exchange platforms to let their products compound without impediment, and without the need for commensurate capital investment to support new levels of volume.</p> <p>Though not all new products are successful, after the initial offering, whether an ETF or a futures contract, exchange volume is largely the result of market response to the pure utility or function it provides to potential participants—as opposed to any marketing initiative or incentive the exchange could offer to induce transactions. Coca-Cola (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KO\" title=\"The Coca-Cola Company\">KO</a>) and Philip Morris (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PM\" title=\"Philip Morris International Inc.\">PM</a>) spent scores of billions of dollars to secure expanding and persistent sales; the securities exchange is simply open for business.</p> <p>In the case of derivatives, if the product solves some market need for hedging or speculation, then there is a fair chance of success. If the contract grows in popularity, the exchange infrastructure—its fixed cost—is already in place. That infrastructure is, essentially, a trade execution and processing computer system, so it can typically do so with minimal marginal costs to the exchange itself. Processing a thousand orders is not much different for a computer than processing a million. And the most popular products, as defined by market demand, typically become the highest-volume products on the platform.</p> <p>Here are the top contracts in the U.S. exchange traded derivatives markets in 2024, along with their annualized trading volume increase in the past 20 years.</p> <p><strong>Growth of top exchange derivatives over the past 20 years</strong></p> <div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th>Asset Group</th> <th>Subcategory</th> <th>2024 Volume (mm)</th> <th>2004 Volume (mm)</th> <th>20 Year Ann'l Volume % Change</th> <th>20 Year Ann'l Price % Change</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Equity</td> <td>Individual Security Products</td> <td>6,519</td> <td>1,017</td> <td>9.7%</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Equity</td> <td>Exchange Traded Products</td> <td>4,659</td> <td>51</td> <td>25.3%</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Equity</td> <td>Equity Index Products</td> <td>2,583</td> <td>417</td> <td>9.6%</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Interest Rates</td> <td>Medium Term (2-10 years)</td> <td>1,752</td> <td>463</td> <td>6.9%</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Interest Rates</td> <td>STIRS</td> <td>1,417</td> <td>448</td> <td>5.9%</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Energy</td> <td>Natural Gas</td> <td>403</td> <td>39</td> <td>12.4%</td> <td>-7.1%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Energy</td> <td>WTI</td> <td>290</td> <td>66</td> <td>7.7%</td> <td>-0.1%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Interest Rates</td> <td>Long Term (&gt;10 years)</td> <td>285</td> <td>15</td> <td>15.9%</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Other</td> <td>Equity</td> <td>269</td> <td>0</td> <td>49.2%</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Agriculture</td> <td>Corn (Maize)</td> <td>131</td> <td>32</td> <td>7.4%</td> <td>3.7%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Energy</td> <td>Electricity Products</td> <td>122</td> <td>1</td> <td>30.5%</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Currencies</td> <td>USD vs Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa</td> <td>115</td> <td>31</td> <td>6.7%</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Metals</td> <td>Gold</td> <td>109</td> <td>20</td> <td>8.8% / 12%*</td> <td>11.0%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Agriculture</td> <td>Soybeans</td> <td>94</td> <td>25</td> <td>6.8%</td> <td>2.2%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Currencies</td> <td>USD vs Asia Pacific</td> <td>91</td> <td>11</td> <td>11.3%</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Other</td> <td>Bitcoin 6-Year Volume: 2024 vs. 2018</td> <td>83</td> <td>2(2018)</td> <td>83.13%(2018)</td> <td>71.6%(2018)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Agriculture</td> <td>Wheat</td> <td>61</td> <td>14</td> <td>7.7%</td> <td>1.9%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Currencies</td> <td>USD vs Americas</td> <td>52</td> <td>9</td> <td>9.1%</td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Agriculture</td> <td>Soy Meal</td> <td>50</td> <td>10</td> <td>8.6%</td> <td>2.2%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Agriculture</td> <td>Soy Oil</td> <td>50</td> <td>9</td> <td>9.2%</td> <td>3.9%</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p>Source: Futures Industry Association, World Bank (for commodity pricing)</p> <p>* The 12% figure includes all global exchanges covered by the Futures Industry Association, not just U.S. exchange-traded contracts.</p> </td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table>\n<span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button>\n</div> <p>Overall, market volume has expanded at more than a 10% annual rate over this 20-year span. Which, as is obvious, exceeds the growth rates of GDP (4.4%) and U.S. corporate profits (6.0%). One will note not only the diverse range of assets absent from the equity indexes—including the mundane like soy oil and wheat—but that even the volumes of those quotidian agricultural commodities have exceeded corporate profit growth. Moreover, as impressive as the rates of core product offerings of the early 2000s have been, newer products have taken center-stage.</p> <ul> <li>As ETF growth has exploded, so too have ETF derivatives volumes—futures, options—such as those relating to SPY and QQQ.</li> <li>Bitcoin is now a top #20 contract; the asset itself did not even exist until 2009, and futures trading didn't commence until 2017.</li> <li>Although electricity demand has been pretty flat in the US for 20 years, the volatile nature of the markets (pricing, weather events, regional dislocations) has led to an increase in contract volume of over 30% annualized over a period of 20 years. A wheat farmer facing uncertain weather halfway through the growing season might wish to hedge that risk by selling some of the future crop in advance—that is, for future delivery. Similarly, a utility company facing possible summer drought conditions for its hydro-electric power plants might purchase some futures—electricity for future receipt—to make up for any output shortages. Note the difference between the return to the exchange itself of electricity contract volume, and the returns to the S&amp;P 500 of electric utility sector.</li> </ul> <p>In practice, it hasn't mattered which contracts succeed, only that capital markets continue to operate in order to accommodate the innumerable changing needs of a working economy. A working economy requires a bridge between the physical world (like commodities—wheat, gold and oil) and the financial world (currency, interest rates, stock indexes), a place where both immediate and future supplies can find buyers, buyers can find sellers, risk can be hedged, or prospective returns magnified. <em>Exchanges are the crossroads between the physical world and the financial.</em></p> <p>This is why the securities and derivatives exchanges have always been able to capture new assets, new financial vehicles, and new technologies (indifferent to the winners and losers). And why they have grown in excess of the underlying price of those same assets. How does that happen?</p> <p>Put simply: trading begets more trading. More activity typically leads to tighter spreads, providing better execution prices for traders, and making platforms more attractive. Each trade or each tick helps reflect new information on assets, and even the smallest price movements can incentivize activity for those looking to capitalize on perceived mispricing. Similarly, new positions can require offsetting positions in other assets, as traders need to efficiently manage margin and collateral to fit their allowed exposures.</p> <p>The prior charts highlighted exchange performance versus local country indexes and exchange-traded derivative volume growth in the US. But how did those individual contract volumes respond to different levels of price appreciation in the underlying assets? We've broken out the prior volume chart by commodities with more discrete pricing to compare.</p> <p>We have multiple examples of price trajectories, but volume growth has been robust in nearly every instance. Natural gas exhibited a significant price decline in the U.S. over the prior 20 years. Contract volumes were impressive. WTI was pretty flat, but volumes still grew at a robust rate. Bitcoin contract volume was even able to outpace the massive appreciation in underlying market.</p> <p>Gold was the one outlier, but consider these points. First, this chart only highlights exchange-traded contracts on U.S. exchanges. Including all global exchanges covered by the Futures Industry Association, gold contract growth was actually over 12% annualized over the prior 20 years. This is another reason why we hold so many exchanges across the world. Global exchanges do not exhibit a high level of correlation to one another and we are still able to capture market activity no matter where it occurs. Second, the exchanges were not required to make binary bets on the asset to capture growth. And finally, the exchanges did not require much in terms of capital expenditures to service these contracts.</p> <p>Tie in some counter cyclical elements, because exchanges still collect on volume to the downside of asset pricing, and you have a really powerful—and, importantly, almost indefinitely long-lived—business.</p> <p><strong>— Brandon Colavita</strong></p> <hr> <h4>Creative Destruction (Obsolescence) and Concentration in the S&amp;P 500: The One-Generation Change in the Top 10</h4> <div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th>At Sept. 1988</th> <th>Sector</th> <th>At Sept. 2025</th> <th>Sector</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>IBM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IBM\" title=\"International Business Machines Corporation\">IBM</a>)</td> <td>Information Tech</td> <td>NVIDIA Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>)</td> <td>Information Tech</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Exxon Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>)</td> <td>Energy</td> <td>Microsoft Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>)</td> <td>Information Tech</td> </tr> <tr> <td>General Electric (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GE\" title=\"General Electric Company\">GE</a>)</td> <td>Electrical Equip.</td> <td>Apple Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>).</td> <td>Information Tech</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Royal Dutch Pete</td> <td>Energy</td> <td>Alphabet Inc (GOOG,GOOGL)</td> <td>Information Tech*</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AT&amp;T (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T\" title=\"AT&amp;T Inc.\">T</a>)</td> <td>Industrials, Miscell.</td> <td> <a href=\"https://amazon.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon.com</a> Inc</td> <td>Information Tech*</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Ford Motor Co (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/F\" title=\"Ford Motor Company\">F</a>)</td> <td>Autos</td> <td>Broadcom Inc (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>)</td> <td>Information Tech</td> </tr> <tr> <td>General Motors (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GM\" title=\"General Motors Company\">GM</a>) Corp</td> <td>Autos</td> <td>Meta Platforms (ME<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T\" title=\"AT&amp;T Inc.\">T</a>A)</td> <td>Information Tech*</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Merck &amp; Co (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MRK\" title=\"Merck &amp; Co., Inc.\">MRK</a>)</td> <td>Drugs</td> <td>Tesla (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T\" title=\"AT&amp;T Inc.\">T</a>SLA) Inc</td> <td>Consumer Discr.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Philip Morris Cos (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PM\" title=\"Philip Morris International Inc.\">PM</a>)</td> <td>Tobacco</td> <td>Berkshire Hathaway (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BRK.B\" title=\"Berkshire Hathaway Inc.\">BRK.B</a>)</td> <td>Financials</td> </tr> <tr> <td>BellSouth Corp</td> <td>Telephones</td> <td>JPMorgan Chase (J<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PM\" title=\"Philip Morris International Inc.\">PM</a>)</td> <td>Financials</td> </tr> <tr> <td>* Standard &amp; Poor's classifies Amazon as Consumer Discretionary, and Meta and Alphabet as CommunicationSources: Salomon Brothers; iShares</td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table>\n<span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button>\n</div> <h2>Next Batter Up: Localized Inflation Investing vs. Scarcity Investing</h2> <h3>Preamble: Is There Inflation? You Gonna Believe the CPI or Your Lying Eyes?</h3> <p>It's almost impossible to read a Horizon Kinetics (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HKHC\" title=\"Horizon Kinetics Holding Corporation\">OTCPK:HKHC</a>) paper of the past half-decade without a reference to inflation's preeminence as a threat to capital preservation, and its near inexorable approach. It's also almost impossible to see inflation in the reports of official figures like the Consumer Price Index.</p> <p>One reason is that measuring inflation, at least as practiced by economists, is surprisingly challenging. Partly because consumer behavior shifts in response to price changes: If beef prices rise enough, consumers will substitute cheaper food items. Therefore, the price of the basket of foods that enters the CPI calculations will not measure the full price impact. Yet price increase certainly does impact that family.</p> <p>More than that, it is well-nigh impossible to develop a consensus around whether such inflation even exists. That's because different societal constituencies have radically different perceptions of the magnitude of inflation: food and rent price increases might be near-intolerable for low-income consumers, yet almost below the notice of high-income consumers (and of policy makers as consumers, too).</p> <p>Even the elegant example of the Big Mac Index, which made its first appearance in The Economist magazine in 1986, fails to determine a societally internally consistent level of inflation. The engagingly simple idea was that this particular fat/salt/sugar delivery vehicle (yes, protein, too) embodies its own basket of inputs. Not only various food commodities, but also labor, rent and energy costs, among others. Nor does determining the average price of a Big Mac entail any data collection, methodology or policy controversy; the data source is simply the price charged at the digitized restaurant counter.</p> <p>Yet the Big Max Index is also problematic: as of April of this year, the average pre-tax price of that commodities-on-a-bun construction ranged from $4.68 in Texas to $6.72 in Massachusetts, a 44% differential. <sup>10 </sup>The U.S. is large enough that cost pressures can vary greatly by region.</p> <p>To continue this exercise in inflation indeterminacy:</p> <ul> <li>For the 12 months through August 2025, the CPI increased by 2.9%.</li> <li>For the 12 months through this August, the restaurant industry's Total Food Away From Home category experienced menu price inflation of 3.9% —and, for full-service restaurants, 4.6%.</li> <li>The 16-month average Big Mac price, from year-end 2023 to April 2025, is up an annual 9.2%. <sup>11</sup> </li> </ul> <p>The restaurant sector is a more important factor in GDP than one might think. In addition to food sales, it includes 15% of the entire U.S. workforce, plus real estate rental costs, plus supplies purchases, and so forth. A problem in the restaurant industry is almost by definition a problem for the U.S. economy.</p> <p>Moreover, the above figures <em>underreport </em>inflation. Restaurants have not raised their menu or output prices as much as the input prices they pay. The reason is that limited-service restaurants—fast food restaurants in civilian parlance—assert that their customers resist menu price increases in proportion to the menu inflation rate. Price increases result in diminished traffic. The inability to raise prices will naturally result in compressed profit margins.</p> <p>That is seen in the Producer Price Index for Food Wholesaling: The food input costs with which the restaurant companies must contend rose by 10.0% in the 12 months through this August.</p> <p>That illustrates the problem. Vast sections of the public have been experiencing a troubling increase in inflation for some years now, a phenomenon objectively confirmed by restaurant industry menu prices. And restaurant sector investors apparently perceive the problem, too, as manifested in poor returns since the convenient inception of the Advisor Shares Restaurant ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EATZ\" title=\"AdvisorShares Restaurant ETF\">EATZ</a>) almost five years ago. EATZ appreciated by an annual 3.3% during the period, and the McDonald's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD\" title=\"McDonald's Corporation\">MCD</a>) figure is 8.4%. <sup>12 </sup>McDonald's is number 43 in the S&amp;P 500. Nevertheless, neither the perception nor the data is registered in the government's headline inflation statistic, the CPI.</p> <figure contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-1761865556302301.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Since-Inception Chart of Advisor Shares Restaurant ETF (&lt;a href='https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EATZ' title='AdvisorShares Restaurant ETF'&gt;EATZ&lt;/a&gt;).

And Why Could It Be Important to Me?</h2> <h2>A Historical Example of an Important Wealth Preservation Risk and an Effective Hedge</h2> <p>If an accepted measure of inflation has yet to be achieved, it follows that there can't be a coherent government policy around it. However, even if there were such a policy, the risk to—or investment opportunity for—any individual is more likely to be <strong>localized inflation </strong>, meaning local to a specific commodity or locale or one very narrow segment of the economy, rather than generalized inflation.</p> <p>For instance, if the price of oil were to soar, as happened in the 1970s, you might think to mitigate the problem by owning appropriately sized investments in the oil industry. Here's how that would play out:</p> <ul> <li> <em>The Capital Preservation Risk: </em>If you spend 5% of disposable income on petroleum-related products like gasoline, heating oil and natural gas, then, all else constant, a doubling of oil prices would reduce your disposable income by 5%.</li> <li> <em>Ostensible Solution: </em>Allocate 5% of your investment portfolio to petroleum producers. Then—if the portfolio is at least the size of your annual spending and saving—it would increase enough to offset the energy-based loss of purchasing power.</li> </ul> <p>This might seem like a logical course of action, but in practice, that strategy failed. There is a vast difference between owning a corporation that drills for oil, and owning the cash flow directly connected to the price and production volume of oil. A lot happens in a corporation's income statement between the revenue line and the net income line. Also on the balance sheet, and between the starting and ending valuation multiples of the corporation's shares. That strategy worked this way...</p> <ul> <li>Oil averaged $1.82 per barrel in 1972, and by 1974 increased over five-fold to $11.</li> <li>The price of Exxon at year-end 1972 was $2.73 per share (adjusted downward to reflect stock splits), but by year-end 1974 had declined by 26% to $2.02.</li> </ul> <p>While ExxonMobil (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XOM\" title=\"Exxon Mobil Corporation\">XOM</a>) is a hedge against inflation in theory, in practice any meaningful inflationary trend is likely to be accompanied by higher interest rates. Higher rates reduce the value of most capital assets. This is rational, since the company's reserves replacement costs will increase, perhaps substantially—everything from labor and equipment to new land leases and reserves. Thus, an Exxon investor will never have access to the entirety of the company's putative earnings, the woulda coulda shoulda earnings.</p> <p>Although the long-term share price of ExxonMobil—one of the best-performing energy companies—is clearly <em>correlated </em>with the price of oil, it does not seem to outperform oil. Particularly when it would be most helpful, during an oil price spike. This can be seen in the accompanying chart, spanning 23 years from a then-relative low in oil prices to a recent relative high.</p> <p>A better way to benefit from localized oil price inflation is through an oil royalty trust.

Although net royalty acres are fixed at inception, advances in petroleum geology engineering mean that as of 2024, SBR's proved oil and gas reserves are substantially higher than in 1999, despite all the production from those reserves over the course of those 25 years, and despite Sabine Royalty incurring no capital expenditures for 25 years.</p> <figure contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618655562578866.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Line chart titled 'WTI Crude Oil vs Exxon (&lt;span&gt;XOM&lt;/span&gt;) vs Sabine Royalty Trust (&lt;a href='https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBR' title='Sabine Royalty Trust'&gt;SBR&lt;/a&gt;)'.

Because the cash flow is distributed monthly, with no reinvestment requirement, oil or natural gas price increases will automatically be translated in short order to distributable income. Its business model is to just collect royalty checks, pay the 0.7% of revenues (!) it incurs in administrative costs, and send the remaining 99.3% to unit holders.</p> <p>That makes it a suitable hedge against oil and gas price increases. Nor need one anticipate inflation to make good use of such an instrument—it's not a binary win-or-lose choice.

The largest three gold ETFs hold 1,678 metric tonnes of gold. That is twice the increase in global demand over the past decade. It's a third of annual global demand. And contrary to the ordinarily understood laws of supply and demand, the mere existence of ETFs is creating incentives for gold miners to <em>not </em>produce gold.</p> <p>This is because a sober mining company management cannot respond as it once might have to an apparent increase in demand, if that demand is from ETF buyers. The miner must maintain a disciplined production profile to avoid the severe financial repercussions of committing long-term production capital in response to a very fidgety buyer.

In 2020, Newmont Mining adopted a stated goal of reducing such emissions by 32% for the ensuing 10 years. But gold mining's carbon footprint is not just a matter of powering the machinery to extract ore. The ore must be smelted in a furnace under intense heat, not so different in that sense than steel production, which necessarily involves an intense use of carbon. There isn't a way to reduce CO <sub>2 </sub>emissions by 2% to 3% a year without limiting production increases.</p> <p>All these factors—the oversupply position a decade ago, introducing climate change goals into production planning, and the demand/supply uncertainty around the financialization of the gold market—has had a clearly observable impact on production. Capital expenditures peaked in 2015, and global mine production has been flat ever since.</p> <p>There is also the fact that ore grades (the proportion of gold in the rock extracted in the mining process) are declining materially. The average gold grade was 1.31 g/t Au in 2022, down 13.4% since 2012, <sup>14 </sup>and poised to fall further as miners expand into deeper/lower quality mine plans. This not only increases the all-in sustaining cost for mine break-evens, but is considerably more carbon intensive.</p> <figure contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-1761865556196639.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Bar chart titled 'Mine production of gold worldwide from 2010 to 2024 (in metric tons)'.

Demand has gradually caught up to the level of available supply. But, there won’t be sustained new supply from the mining sector. Even if only from a basic engineering and permitting perspective, new mine production of significance can’t just be “ramped up” on a dime; not even in a decade. As just discussed, it’s unlikely to happen on a corporate policy basis, either.</p> <p>When supply can’t be increased in the face of higher demand, even if the incremental demand is modest, price becomes the balancing factor, and those price changes can be truly disproportionate. We’re calling that localized inflation, because it's completely uncorrelated with the ordinary systemic factors like national monetary policy or the general inflation rate.</p> <p>For all of this discussion about mining companies and gold, at Horizon Kinetics we bought neither.

Upon recovering its initial investment, its subsequent return on capital is nearly astronomical.</p> <ul> <li>Unlike the metal, the royalty company has an ongoing high-level ROE, even when the gold price is not rising, so a financial return is always being earned.</li> <li>Unlike the miner, there are no capital expenditure requirements and virtually no operating expense.

We spent so much time on them because there's a payoff: In gold, the phenomenon of localized inflation is already apparent, but the other extractive industries will eventually have the same experience.</p> <p>The financial markets won't help these companies either. Extraction-based commodity production is very capital intensive, but it is exceedingly difficult for producers to attract significant equity capital, because they can't compete with the need to raise fantastic amounts of capital for data centers and artificial intelligence projects. Would you be more likely to answer the phone for a chance to invest in: A) an iron ore mine with a payback period beginning in 10 years; or B) a datacenter developer that's up and running in a few? With little or no equity capital available to them, there's not much chance for mining companies to address a supply deficiency even if they perceive a long-term demand opportunity.</p> <p>This raises three lines of related thought relative to portfolio positioning.</p> <p>One is that future <em>localized inflation </em>can often be anticipated with a high degree of confidence. We've seen to what great effect that understanding can be put, using the appropriate asset-light vehicle. All that's required is patience for the compounding to manifest.</p> <p>A second thought is that <em>scarcity value </em>can magnify the return possibilities of a localized inflation beneficiary. While Sabine Royalty was an astoundingly more successful beneficiary of higher oil prices and inflation than an actual extraction company like Exxon, scarcity value was not one of the attributes of its superior performance.</p> <p>The additional attribute of scarcity value can apply two ways: to the asset itself; and to the security associated with it, as when a company attracts more buying interest than its stock market capitalization can support—when there aren't enough shares to go around.</p> <p>A company that embodies both anticipatory localized inflation and scarcity value could be extraordinarily remunerative.</p> <p>A third thought is that <em>even a small-cap company </em>can control or be economically linked to an asset that is critical to—meaning a limiting factor for—a large industry. It is possible for such a small company to be the largest such in its economic sector or geographical area. In the right circumstance, it can achieve terms of trade advantage with an industry's dominant companies. Historically, superior ROE and financial performance are a function of having pricing power.</p> <figure contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Illustration of a mouse wearing a crown and holding a trumpet, with the text 'THE MOUSE THAT ROARED'.\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"151\" height=\"175\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170680962.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>This might seem like a does-not-compute proposition in a world with an almost monomaniacal focus on the largest, most-owned companies that owe some of their preeminence to sheer scale and the market power that comes with it. But consider one illustrative out-of-the way example, and then one or two more obvious ones that, like gold, are likely to be top-of-mind in the foreseeable future.</p> <p>The out-of-the-way example is potash. Potash, you say? This is what provides potassium, one of the three essential crop nutrients, the other two being nitrogen and phosphorus. Global food production at the current scale would collapse without their near-constant application.</p> <p>The rising future demand curve for crop fertilizers is based on some inexorable factors that are noticeably similar to prior discussions about why demand for oil and gas is not going to fade away any time soon:</p> <ul> <li>The global population continues to rise, which proportionately requires additional fertilizers.</li> <li>Food demand rises faster than population, because rising standards of living in poorer nations come with greater caloric intake.</li> <li>Further, a higher share of that new caloric intake is from animal products and other calorie-rich foods like vegetable oils, which require incrementally more crop production than grains and legumes.</li> <li>Importantly, the amount of arable land does not increase, which means that, on a per-capita basis, cropland is in constant decline: from 4,000 square meters in the 1960s to about 2,500 sqm in 2000. 2,500 sqm is about half the size of an American football field, including the end zones. Per-capita cropland was last projected by a U.N. study to fall to 1,900 sqm by 2030.</li> <li>All of this means higher required crop yields, which will require disproportionately more fertilizer, net of other yield enhancement technologies and process improvements.</li> </ul> <p>This sequential expansion function between population growth, wealth effect and fertilizer demand is shown in the accompanying chart from BHP (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BHP\" title=\"BHP Group Limited\">BHP</a>) (which mines not only metals and coal, but potash, too).</p> <p>As to demand, 90% of global potash consumption is for agriculture.</p> <p>As to supply, there was a decade-plus expansion to answer a demand cycle that caused prices to quintuple, peaking at $682/ton in 2009.</p> <p>That expansion phase ended around 2015, when potash traded in the $300 range, but created an oversupply position that then caused prices to gradually decline through 2020, to $202.</p> <p>Supply disruptions caused by the Russia sanctions temporarily caused a price spike to $1,200 in 2022 (whoopsie, demand exceeded supply!), but it quickly returned to 2015's $360 range. <sup>15</sup></p> <p>Accordingly, prices are not high enough to induce investment in new supply and reserve replacement, so producers are availing themselves of still-extant surplus capacity. However, that excess capacity is expected to be fully utilized in the next several years...this all sound familiar?</p> <p><strong>Population up ~2.5 fold since 1960, crops ~3.5 fold, potash ~4.5 fold (Index, 1960 = 100)</strong></p> <figure contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658179171288.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart showing Population, Crop production, and Potash fertiliser demand (Index, 1960 = 100) from 1960 to 2020.

Almost 80% of U.S. potash imports comes from Canada. Canada is the world's largest supplier—at a 30%, share—and holds 45% to 60% of global reserves, depending on the calculation method.</p> <p>Within Canada, three companies produce all the potash, two of which produce more than a quarter of global supply. They are asset intensive mining companies, with a host of their own cyclical and capital risks and limitations, no different than for oil or gold extraction. And, wouldn't you know it, there is actually a potash royalty company, and it gets its royalties from those two largest North American potash producers. This is Altius Minerals (A<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/T\" title=\"AT&amp;T Inc.\">T</a>USF).</p> <p>Altius doesn't call itself a potash royalty company, because potash is a bit less than one-third of its royalty revenues. On the other hand, its Base &amp; Battery Metals royalty revenues, which are about 40% of the total, are mostly from copper, which is also very difficult to get exposure to. Another nearly 10% came from iron ore. All of these commodities share the supply/demand dynamics that have been discussed thus far. Another nearly 20% of royalties are from solar and wind power projects, almost exclusively in Texas.</p> <p>To get exposure to these otherwise difficult-to-isolate strategic commodities that are each steadily approaching their localized scarcity expression moments—when the demand/supply balance tips—Altius has a market value of only $1.2 billion. The combined market cap of the two potash miners, Nutrien and Mosaic, is almost $40 billion. The market cap of Freeport-McMoRan (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/F\" title=\"Ford Motor Company\">F</a>CX), the copper miner is nearly $60 billion.</p> <p>Another frame of reference for the scarcity value of a $1.2 billion company like Altius Minerals: the lowest-weight stock in the S&amp;P 500, at less than 1/100 <sup>th </sup>of one percent, is News Corp (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NWSA\" title=\"News Corporation\">NWSA</a>). It has a stock market value of $15 billion. Which company has superior portfolio-relevant characteristics?

For the more recent five years to 2024, gas consumption rose at a 1.25% rate and was again exceeded by production volume growth of 2.2%.</p> <p>That defines oversupply, and the price reflects it. Since the roughly 2014 peak in hard commodity price, the price of natural gas is about flat. In inflation-adjusted terms, “flat” means about 67% lower.</p> <p>The anemic demand for natural gas is linked to a near-absence of new electric power demand. For the five years between 2014 and 2019, U.S. electric power supply rose only 0.14% a year. In the next five years to 2024, supply rose at a 0.72% rate. The more recent years' rise in demand, modest though it was, is partly attributable to datacenter growth. Those were the cloud storage datacenters that pre-date the 2023/2024 AI datacenter era.</p> <p>Interestingly, natural gas use for electric power generation category rose by 66% in the 10 years to 2024, or by over 5% per year. This had nothing to do with the datacenter boom. It was as a replacement for coal, which declined from 43% of total to 16%, while natural gas rose from 30% to 47% of U.S. utility-scale power generation. However, it does show that natural gas will be the fuel of choice for the datacenter buildout.</p> <p><strong>Natural Gas Price (Henry Hub (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HUBG\" title=\"Hub Group, Inc.\">HUBG</a>))</strong></p> <figure contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-1761865817651807.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Line chart showing Natural Gas Price (Henry Hub) from July 2016 to July 2025.

The share price of NRG Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NRG\" title=\"NRG Energy, Inc.\">NRG</a>), which has placed itself at the forefront of capturing datacenter demand for access to the electric grid power, expanded from trailing 2024 earnings to year-forward estimated earnings. <sup>18 </sup>Utility company shares, somnolent for a decade, outperformed the S&amp;P 500 in this bull market year.</p> <p>Electricity demand is now rising on a heretofore unknown scale. Rather than reprise another lengthy exercise in deriving those figures, here's a shorthand sketch from someone who knows a lot about datacenters. Unknown to us except through a six-week-old transcript, this gentleman caught our attention as an outcome-agnostic third party without a particular angle to work. He's not an investment banker, a data center owner or developer, or even an electric utility CEO. He's just, to do him a oversimplifying injustice, a builder for hire who knows certain datacenter essentials from the inside, the nuts and bolts, out.</p> <p>He elucidates many of the same concepts with which our clients have become familiar. Among them: the mind boggling scale of the demand; the area-density limitations of solar and wind power—separate from the intermittency problem—and the impracticality of the land resources they require for other than supplemental use. The same for the storage limitations of batteries and the requirement, in turn, for backup natural gas generators even when renewables are being used.</p> <p>Other than saying this is EMCOR (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EME\" title=\"EMCOR Group, Inc.\">EME</a>) Group (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EME\" title=\"EMCOR Group, Inc.\">EME</a>) Chairman and CEO Anthony Guzzi, he'll introduce himself through selected excerpts from a recent presentation, with which many condensing liberties were taken. <sup>19</sup></p> <blockquote> <p>If you just take it at the top level, EMCOR is a company where we actually do the work, right? We're a company of plumbers, pipefitters, electricians, sprinkler fitters, HVAC technicians, and operating engineers. So, said simply, we're a skilled trades company. If you look at trades, we're up here at the top of the food chain. We're looking to either build something, fix something, retrofit it, and then do ongoing maintenance.</p> <p>Now, if you think about overall, at our heart, we're contractors. So that by definition, we're flexible, we adapt, and we don't really create demand. And we have to have our company positioned to be able to execute for our customers.</p> <p>What's favorable now? A lot of people want to build gas pipelines right now, so we're going through some compressor stations. The power sector is more thoughtful, I would say, right now. The engineers are back in charge, the people that actually understand the energy industry and what it takes to baseload a grid, what latent power really means in a grid to keep it running, what it takes to power data.</p> <p>So, think about a data center, think about regulation. Data centers went from being 10 megawatts, 20 megawatts when we were building for people like Morgan Stanley (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MS\" title=\"Morgan Stanley\">MS</a>) or JPMorgan (J<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PM\" title=\"Philip Morris International Inc.\">PM</a>), 2005, 2006. Then we started building these cloud storage data centers, which are still growing high single digits. And they were 50 megawatts. Folks, that's a lot of power.</p> <p>And now, cloud storage is sort of getting up to 100 megawatts. AI is about 200 megawatts to 300 megawatts. So let's put that in perspective for you. 200 megawatts? There's about, let's say, four people in a household. <strong>200 megawatts is probably the power needed for 15,000 to 20,000 people, so a mid-sized town, small town.</strong></p> <p><strong>Cartoon by Paul Noth</strong></p> </blockquote> <figure contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-1761865817602201.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Cartoon by Paul Noth showing a large, modern data center building next to a small, traditional house, with a person standing in the yard.

That is clearly expressed in the Nvidia share price, at 28x next-year earnings, versus ExxonMobil at 15x estimated earnings. As quickly as the valuation view of electric power producers was altered, so can it be altered for natural gas producers.</p> <h2>Demand in the Global Market</h2> <p>The U.S. is not the only market for natural gas, of course. In 2016, Cheniere (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LNG\" title=\"Cheniere Energy, Inc.\">LNG</a>) was the first company in 40 years approved to export liquefied natural gas overseas. Between 2015 and 2024, LNG exports from the U.S. rose from 28 billion cubic feet to 4,367 bcf. Cheniere, which exports more than the next three largest companies combined and accounts for near 40% of total U.S. exports, <sup>21 </sup>estimates that the global LNG market in the next five years will expand at a 6% rate. U.S. natural gas, upon delivery, is far cheaper than in Europe and Asia.</p> <p>To date, the great majority of LNG shipments has been to Europe, but the amount of regasification facilities under construction in China means it is preparing to import a great deal more.</p> <p>China's and India's natural gas consumption is exceedingly low relative to their populations and industrial capacity, because they still rely heavily on coal. They should be anticipated to purchase much greater quantities in the future. No small portion of this need—aside from rising per-capita income—will be to enable their own AI datacenter expansions. AI buildout has rapidly taken on a national security and global competitive character.</p> <p>These five countries—China, the U.S., India, Russia, and Japan—dwarf all others in electricity generation. For example, Germany's total is 5% that of China, and one-quarter of India's.</p> <figure contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658170873764.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Line graph titled 'Liquefied U.S. Natural Gas Exports' showing exports in Million Cubic Feet from 2015 to 2025.

AI datacenter demand for natural gas, inclusive of the socioeconomic dynamics of the world's two most populous nations, should eventually intersect with gas supply.</p> <p>Which brings us to the particularly localized form of inflation that applies to natural gas.</p> <h4>Largest Natural Gas Consumers (2024)</h4> <div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th></th> <th>(in billion cubic meters)</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>United States</td> <td>902.2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Russia</td> <td>477.0</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>China</strong></td> <td><strong>434.4</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Iran</td> <td>245.4</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Saudi Arabia</td> <td>121.5</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>India</strong></td> <td><strong>70.3</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Source: 2025 Energy Institute Statistical Review of World Energy</strong></td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table>\n<span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button>\n</div> <h2>The Localized Nature of Natural Gas Supply</h2> <p>Simultaneous with being a global commodity like oil, coal or gold, natural gas is unlike them in that it is also distinctly localized. The others can—variously—be driven, trucked, pipelined, or trained; gold can be flown. They effectively have 100% domestic distribution reach.</p> <p>But natural gas can't always be brought to where it's needed. There are 3 million miles of gas pipeline in the U.S., but there do arise new areas of demand or new sources of supply that have insufficient or no pipeline access. Gas is too diffuse to transport except via pipeline; it won't get in a truck. It is exceedingly difficult to build a new pipeline, though. The many local interests that oppose such construction can keep a proposed project in court for a very long time. There's a long list of abandoned projects, even of the billion-dollar scale.</p> <p>This can lead to highly localized supply/demand distortions. There can be a surfeit of natural gas at the well head, but a shortage where it's needed: the electricity generation plant. Those who require large quantities of new electric power might have to migrate—power plant and all—to where the gas can be had.</p> <p>Another unique limitation of natural gas as a commodity is storage: It takes a lot of room unless liquefied, which is too expensive for this purpose, and the storage capacity of U.S. gas tanks is finite. Even the most minor supply/demand imbalance can have a dramatic impact. On June 9, 2022, U.S. natural gas futures plummeted $1.27/million btu, roughly 15%, when a fire at a Texas LNG producer caused a loss of about 2 billion cubic feet of export capacity for a few months. That volume, which would have been liquefied, had to be stored. This was not even 1/10 <sup>th </sup>of 1% of national storage capacity. <sup>22 </sup>But it occurred during the peak summer season for filling gas storage tanks. So, inelastic demand for limited supply: price regulates.</p> <p>That understanding is now making its way into a few publications. The accompanying extraordinarily condensed excerpts from an article in the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>—sent our way by a Managing Director at a large and storied global private wealth manager who happens to know that not all of us read it—about a newly announced giga-scale datacenter notes the risk to datacenters that were built without considering the availability of sufficient sustained power supply.</p> <p>The article also hints that the requisite supply of gas should be had on a sufficiently large tract of land that is definitely not proximate to any population center. One area that can supply both needs is West Texas, where this project is being built.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td> <p>THE WALL STREET JOURNAL</p> <h2>A Giant New AI Data Center Is Coming to the Epicenter of America's Fracking Boom</h2> <p>By Bradley Olson [Follow]</p> <p>Oct. 15, 2025 9:06 am ET</p> <p>An Nvidia-backed AI startup is planning to build a massive datacenter complex that is capable of generating its own power on a site that is two-thirds the size of Central Park...on a sprawling ranch in West Texas...located near natural-gas production and processing sites and already has long-haul fiber routes.</p> <p>Many planned facilities across the U.S. have been built without power generation capabilities.

The more limiting factors that a datacenter planner must simultaneously solve for, the fewer the choices of location. For instance, the article does mention water sufficiency, but within the scope of the full article only as a tangential reference. It is anything but tangential. In fact, water is likely to be the ultimate limiting factor in the AI electric power demand era.</p> <p>Supply, again, is the reason. Water is the world's scarcest critical commodity. In a survival priority list, air is the most critical commodity. Everyone knows that. We can tolerate an \"air shortage\" for a matter of a few minutes. But air is both free and freely available everywhere around us. Water comes next on the survival list; that's a matter of a few days. We do pay for water, though so little in this nation that it's often experienced as if it's as plentiful as air, so most of us hardly think about it.</p> <p>The reality is that over 97% of the world's water is in the oceans or other saline bodies of water. Of the 3% that's fresh water, 2.5% points are unavailable, being fixed in ice, or in the ground or atmosphere. That leaves 0.5%. <sup>23 </sup>In the U.S., the largest user of that 0.5%—more than for crop irrigation—are electric power plants. <sup>24 </sup>And those figures are 10 years old, well before even the cloud data-center power demand era.</p> <h4>Where Water is Found</h4> <div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody> <tr> <td>Oceans</td> <td>97.2%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Ice Caps/Glaciers</td> <td>2.0%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Groundwater*</td> <td>0.62%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Freshwater Lakes</td> <td>0.009%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Inland seas/salt lakes</td> <td>0.008%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Atmosphere</td> <td>0.001%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Rivers</td> <td>0.0001%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>TOTAL</td> <td>99.8381%</td> </tr> <tr> <td>*Some of this lies too far under the earth's surface to be extracted at an affordable cost</td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody></table>\n<span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button>\n</div> <p>Power plant water use is on a scale as mindbogglingly great as the amount of electricity that Nvidia chips draw. The reason is that they are all thermal plants—whether powered by coal, nuclear or natural gas—boiling the water to produce the steam to rotate the turbine to turn the generator that makes the electricity. An AI datacenter’s natural gas power plant will need the same water an electric utility plant does.</p> <p>Finding remote land proximate to natural gas is a necessary but insufficient resource package for an AI datacenter. Water is required, too. Farm country might seem a good idea, but ground water for irrigation is already problematic throughout much of the country due to chronic excessive withdrawals that have begun to damage aquifers.</p> <p>The western Permian Basin (Delaware Basin) has a dramatic excess supply of natural gas. This is primarily due to a large amount of “associated gas” that is produced as a byproduct in oil wells, and exacerbated by inadequate pipeline takeaway capacity. The price of gas at the local (Permian) Waha Hub is not infrequently negative (producers <em>pay </em>someone to take their gas). The western Permian also sits atop an enormous underground aquifer of non-potable brackish water. Distinct from the brackish water, there is water mixed with the hydrocarbons in the rock formations, such that drilling activity brings up about four times as much water as oil.</p> <p>Logic dictates that datacenter buildout will migrate to where the essential multi-resource package is readily available. The size of the profit opportunity in water for incumbent providers and handlers in that region is very surprising to the uninitiated. It’s a discussion that won’t be done justice in these last few pages, so Part III next quarter will review that phenomenon, both in water and for companies that control or have royalty interests in land and water provision (since these are inextricably linked).</p> <div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td> <p>THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.</p> <h3>This Texas Town Is an Energy Powerhouse.It’s Running Out of Water.</h3> <p>Severe drought has Corpus Christi scrambling to meet growing demand from companies like Exxon and Tesla</p> <p>By Benoit Morene [Follow]</p> <p>Oct. 12, 2025 11:00 am ET</p> </td></tr></tbody></table>\n<span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button>\n</div> <h2>Not an Oxymoron: Buying Big Economic Market Power in Small-Cap Companies</h2> <figure contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658897961264.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"small image of a mouse with the caption 'the mouse that roared'\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"74\" height=\"61\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658897961264.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658897961264.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658897961264.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658897961264.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658897961264.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658897961264.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658897961264.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/542689-17618658897961264.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of which, these companies are of a size that excludes them from the indexes (go ahead, take a look).

A demonstration of the economic significance of this business, as de minimis as it might seem, is that if water takeaway activity is curtailed or stopped, then drilling must be curtailed or stopped, since about four barrels of water come up from the well with every oil-equivalent barrel. There must be a place to put it.</p> <p>A virtually identical company operating in the same area, <strong>Aris Water Solutions (ARIS) </strong>, was acquired two weeks ago by a natural gas pipeline company for $1.5 billion. WaterBridge's 2,500 miles of pipeline have produced water handling volumes of about 2.4 million barrels/day; Aris's water handling volume was 1.2 million barrels/day. These volumes will continue to expand, even if oil-and-gas volumes weren't to, because as wells either age or go deeper, the proportion of water produced rises. Of course, pricing can rise, too.</p> <p>If only a single inference-rich metric of this business were to be offered, a good one would be this: the revenue and operating margin in this business, per barrel of water, are about $0.85 and $0.45.

This year, residents moved into the first of three Tejon Ranch master-planned communities to be entitled. The company's strategy is to invest in getting land entitled for commercial and residential development, enhancing the land value with each step in that process.</p> <p>Land is <em>not </em>real estate, though it can become real estate. It certainly isn't a REIT, which is a debt-leveraged, financialized investment that can't compound adequately versus inflation, since it must issue more debt and/or equity in order to fund property acquisitions. If Tejon Ranch is a strategic type of asset, the price for it, in market cap, is $430 million.</p> <p><strong>LandBridge Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LB\" title=\"LandBridge Company LLC\">LB</a>) </strong>controls a portfolio of 277,000 acres in the “core” of drilling activity in the Permian (Delaware) Basin. It was created in October of 2021 to procure land that is requisite for managing water infrastructure in that unique locale. Water infrastructure, unlike oil and gas, is not subject to eminent domain protections, despite water egress and disposal being an essential aspect of hydrocarbon extraction. This is to say, Texas landowners must provide easements (at reasonable rates) to oil and gas infrastructure providers to facilitate energy extraction; no such protection is granted to water infrastructure. The result is surface land being a highly strategic but still underappreciated asset in the energy industry.</p> <p>The company operates similar to a “triple-net” lessor. It incurs minimal expenses (operating and capital) related to the development of the land; it is the lessee—oh, say Chevron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVX\" title=\"Chevron Corporation\">CVX</a>)’s field operations team and potentially Microsoft’s contracted datacenter builder/manager—that bears that burden. In this way, consonant with a royalty business, higher water volumes, market capture and pricing all flow through to the shareholders in a capital efficient manner. The land position also facilitates exceptional returns on invested capital investment opportunities for water infrastructure developers, adding another growth vector.</p> <p>It should be noted that this land is also proximate to various high-profile data center campus developments and is thus well-positioned to benefit from this development—at no incremental cost to the company. Optionality is so prized in the financial markets, and so many sophisticated and often probabilistically improbable strategies are pursued in its name—options, futures, leverage, <em>any </em>kind of technology, growth stock investing, IPO investing, venture capital—that it one almost hears resonant echoes of that old 1980 favorite by Johnny Lee [unfairly butchered to suit <em>this </em>venue]:</p> <blockquote> <h3>Lookin' For Optionality</h3> <p>Well, I spent a lifetime lookin' for you</p> <p>...

It is relatively unusual as being a pureplay on natural gas, of which there are few. This one, at this time, also presents another predictive attribute, a transitory “problem” that provides an equity yield curve opportunity.</p> <p>Unlike a pure royalty, this trust is a “net profit interest” that receives payment net of the operator (Hilcorp) operating and capital costs. The trust is not obligated to provide capital for these costs, but they are deducted from distributions, and in the event of a deficit, accumulated until covered by net cash flows. In practice, there is an interest-free capital contribution arrangement.</p> <p>Hilcorp increased the capital investment budget to $34 million in 2024, compared to $4.4 million in 2023, likely in response to a high realized gas price of $4.69/mcf in 2023. This did in fact result in a roughly 50% production increase, which was confounded by realized gas prices thereafter falling 56%. Accordingly, the Trust had amassed a capital deficit of over $20 million by the end of 2024. This resulted in the suspension of dividends, and an exodus of yield-oriented investors.</p> <p>There are various scenarios based on projected production volumes, capital spending levels and gas prices where the distributions will be reinstated and grow to material amounts. The gas reserves and production haven't gone anywhere and, if anything, run-rate production will be higher, meaning the essential value of the assets is intact. It's just a matter of waiting for the capital deficit to be erased by ongoing royalties, which is—and this is wonderful investment tool in such instances—just a matter of waiting.</p> <p><strong>Altius Minerals Corp. </strong>receives royalties from two miners that supply one-quarter of global potash and three-quarters of U.S. potash needs.

It's stock market value is $1.1 billion.</p> <p>To repeat an earlier compare-an-contrast observation about pure size vs. undiluted economic participation in resource scarcity value: The combined market cap of those two miners (The Mosaic Company (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MOS\" title=\"The Mosaic Company\">MOS</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MOS\" title=\"The Mosaic Company\">MOS</a>) and Nutrien Ltd (N<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TR\" title=\"Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc.\">TR</a>).), sometimes more profitable, sometimes less, is just under $40 billion.</p> <p><strong>Mesabi Trust (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MS\" title=\"Morgan Stanley\">MS</a>B) </strong>holds a royalty interest on the Northshore (iron ore) Mine in the Mesabi Range in northern Minnesota. The mine operator is Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (CL<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/F\" title=\"Ford Motor Company\">F</a>), an integrated iron and steelmaking company. The mine produces a specific type of high-grade iron ore that is a critical input material for electric arc furnace steelmaking. Cliffs has oriented its domestic growth strategy around electric arc furnaces and is thus highly sensitive to producing the requisite feedstock.</p> <p>The royalty agreement dates to 1961. The terms have never been in question until recently. Cliffs decided that it did not want to pay a royalty related to the “premium” for the high-grade ore. An arbitration panel resoundingly agreed with the Trust and awarded $72 million in residual payments in late 2024. However, the parties are now back in front of an arbitration panel for a related issue subsequent to the ruling.</p> <p>The Cliffs attempt to circumvent the royalty agreement obscures a highly valuable iron royalty stream with decades of remaining—and low cost—reserve life. It's not difficult to calculate the current cash flow yield assuming historical mine production levels, current iron prices and the contracted premium. Fortunately, few other investors appear to take the time.</p> <hr> <div class=\"table-responsive\">\n<span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td> <p>Important Disclosures</p> <p>Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Guardant's Screening revenue is now at a 100 million USD run rate, and its MRD business is helping<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to drive growth.

Guardant's therapy selection and biopharma business also remain strong, in part due to improved product capabilities. In addition, Guardant believes that using liquid biopsy to guide switching to a new treatment upon emergence of a resistance mutation will provide significant upside. The SERENA-6 trial with AstraZeneca is important in this regard.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618193092136905_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"375\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618193092136905_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Guardant Health Products\" width=\"640\" height=\"255\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618193092136905_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618193092136905_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618193092136905_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618193092136905_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618193092136905_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618193092136905_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618193092136905_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618193092136905_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure 1: Guardant Health Products <span>(source: Guardant Health)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Reveal is Guardant's fastest-growing oncology product and should be an important growth driver long term due to the nascent state of the market.

Medicare coverage for CRC surveillance was achieved earlier in the year. Guardant also recently submitted its IO monitoring data to MolDx in support of Medicare reimbursement and submitted chemotherapy monitoring data for publication. There is also CDK4/6 inhibitor monitoring and studies across more than 5 additional tumor types.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The introduction of an Ultra-sensitive tissue-informed MRD assay also appears imminent. Guardant Reveal Ultra will bring sensitivity down to the 1 ppm level, which is important given that ultra-high clinical sensitivity remains a challenge for tissue-informed MRD tests.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618194202976642_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"940\" data-height=\"368\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618194202976642_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Reveal Data Pipeline\" width=\"640\" height=\"251\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618194202976642_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618194202976642_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618194202976642_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618194202976642_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618194202976642_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618194202976642_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618194202976642_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618194202976642_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure 3: Reveal Data Pipeline <span>(source: Guardant Health)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Guardant's screening business is also an area of emerging strength, although it hasn't all been smooth sailing. The stock took a hit after the release of the Shield V2 colorectal cancer screening test results, presumably because it fell short of investor expectations. The Shield CRC V2 test improved Stage I sensitivity from 55% to 62%, but otherwise appeared to offer fairly similar performance to the V1 test.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Guardant recently established collaborations with Quest Diagnostics and PathGroup to help drive adoption. Shield is expected to be available for physicians to order through Quest in Q1 2026. Upcoming guideline and HEDIS updates (NCCN, American Cancer Society, USPSTF) could also be a catalyst for long-term growth. Inclusion in the ACS guidelines is expected in the near future, which could set the stage for commercial coverage in a number of states.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618195029665499.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shield Volumes\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"590\" height=\"429\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618195029665499.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618195029665499.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618195029665499.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618195029665499.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618195029665499.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618195029665499.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618195029665499.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618195029665499.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure 4: Shield Volumes <span>(source: Guardant Health)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Shield multi-cancer test is also now broadly available. Physicians need to elect to receive the multi-cancer report, and patients must authorize the release of their medical records to Guardant. This is expected to provide reach to hundreds of thousands of patients and a scalable platform for generating clinical data generation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It will likely be several years before Guardant has the data to support coverage of this product. Early data has been promising, though. For example, a study of over 9,000 people demonstrated 99% specificity and 41% PPV for solid tumors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618195502717588.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shield Multi-Cancer Detection Data\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"590\" height=\"416\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618195502717588.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618195502717588.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618195502717588.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618195502717588.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618195502717588.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618195502717588.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618195502717588.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-17618195502717588.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure 5: Shield Multi-Cancer Detection Data <span>(source: Guardant Health)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Guardant received <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835201-guardant-health-inc-gh-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">2 additional companion diagnostic</a> approvals in Q3.

Guardant's revenue growth rate is now accelerating as its expansion into the MRD and cancer screening markets begins to have a financial impact. These are much larger markets and should drive strong growth long term. The competitive dynamics of these markets are yet to really play out, but Guardant is well positioned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761819700830438.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Guardant Health TAM\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"326\" height=\"104\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761819700830438.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761819700830438.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761819700830438.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761819700830438.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761819700830438.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761819700830438.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761819700830438.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761819700830438.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Table 1: Guardant Health TAM <span>(source: Created by author using data from Guardant Health)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Guardant's revenue multiple has moved significantly higher over the last 12 months, the company remains reasonably valued.

The valuations of liquid biopsy companies as a whole also look low relative to many other sectors given expected revenue growth and margins at scale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761818209658603_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1079\" data-height=\"335\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761818209658603_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Guardant Health EV/S Ratio\" width=\"640\" height=\"199\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761818209658603_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761818209658603_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761818209658603_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761818209658603_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761818209658603_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761818209658603_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761818209658603_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/50485001-1761818209658603_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Figure 10: Guardant Health EV/S Ratio <span>(source: Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside of shifts in competitive dynamics as the technology matures, the primary risks are related to the quality of upcoming data readouts, reimbursement decisions, and inclusion in guidelines. I believe developments in these areas are likely to be favorable, though. I also expect Guardant's revenue growth to remain strong in the near term, and there is potential for the company's revenue multiple to increase as the strength of the business becomes better appreciated. As a result, I remain bullish on Guardant's prospects.</p>",

What’s next for GBP/USD? Let’s discuss.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">GBP/USD: Cable under tension</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As an Englishman, I can say that the collective feeling amongst the British public regarding the UK economy currently leaves much to be desired. The highest inflation of any G7 nation, rising unemployment, and, at best, a middling economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Safe to say, things are not looking too peachy going into Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves' budget next month, which is almost sure to raise taxes in some capacity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Put simply, the current outlook for the UK economy, particularly in terms of public finances, is less than stellar, which is encouraging those to sell the sterling in favour of other currencies.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s take a look at two headline macroeconomic themes within GBP/USD markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-1.width-1400.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1400\" data-height=\"731\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-1.width-1400.png?io=w640\" alt=\"British Pound Currency Index (BXY) &amp; US Dollar Currency Index (&lt;a href='https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DXY' title='US Dollar Index'&gt;DXY&lt;/a&gt;), D1, TVC, TradingView, 30/10/2025\" width=\"1280\" height=\"668\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-1.width-1400.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-1.width-1400.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-1.width-1400.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-1.width-1400.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-1.width-1400.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-1.width-1400.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-1.width-1400.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-1.width-1400.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>British Pound Currency Index (BXY) &amp; US Dollar Currency Index (DXY), D1, TVC, TradingView, 30/10/2025</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">GBP/USD: Fundamental Analysis 30/10/2025</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Markets are nervous of UK fiscal woes:</strong> While the public finances of many developed nations are currently somewhat dubious at best, this is particularly true for the United Kingdom, with a multibillion-pound hole that needs to be addressed by the upcoming budget in November.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While developments concerning the budget continue to do the media rounds, which will inevitably only increase as November 26th approaches, Rachel Reeves is stuck between a rock and a hard place, between honoring campaign pledges not to raise taxes on working people and VAT while simultaneously needing to find an estimated £30bn to balance spending with tax income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To make matters worse, and coming at an inopportune time for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, an assessment to be released on Friday by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) is expected to substantially downgrade UK productivity forecasts, resulting in a further estimate of £20 billion in shortfall.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Not to mention government borrowing also exceeded estimates in the first half of 2025 by £7.2bn as per last week’s <a href=\"https://obr.uk/docs/dlm_uploads/PSF-commentary-September-2025.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\">OBR commentary</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tying this back to GBP/USD, however, is remarkably simple: the fiscal health of the UK economy appears to be worsening, and investors are collectively demanding a higher level of risk premium to hold sterling-denominated assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This fundamental downgrade in sterling’s rating when compared to other stores of wealth is what has led, in no small part, to the recent GBP/USD downside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The UK economy is at serious risk of stagflation.</strong> Granted, the term is often used loosely, but stagflation is a genuine concern for the UK economy. Currently, the Bank of England is faced with a serious ‘catch-22’:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Rising unemployment, now at 4.8%, its highest level since July 2021</li> <li>Poor GDP growth, with recent estimates for Q2 at a measly 0.3%</li> <li>Stubborn inflation, at 3.8% YoY in September and, crucially, almost double the 2.0% target</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Naturally, the top two bullets would support the notion of cutting rates, while stubborn inflation would support hiking, putting Governor Andrew Bailey and his team of decision makers in an inevitable position.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the Bank of England is due to vote on monetary policy on November 6th, most predict their hand will be forced in maintaining rates at 4.00%, owing to recent inflation trends.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-2.width-1400.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1400\" data-height=\"1090\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-2.width-1400.png?io=w640\" alt=\"UK Interest Rates, investing.com 30/10/2025\" width=\"1280\" height=\"997\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-2.width-1400.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-2.width-1400.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-2.width-1400.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-2.width-1400.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-2.width-1400.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-2.width-1400.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-2.width-1400.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_GBP-USD-30-10-2025-2.width-1400.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw -

In short, FLAU offers a better expense ratio, as it is only 9 basis points, far below the 50 basis points for EWA. On the other hand, liquidity is much lower than EWA, with an AUM of $80 million for FLAU. The fund structure is also less concentrated for FLAU, with 54.31% of the fund assets concentrated in the top 10 holdings as opposed to 62.59% for EWA. FLAU has 105 holdings, while EWA has 58.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53538703-1761855867801784.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"416\" height=\"127\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53538703-1761855867801784.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53538703-1761855867801784.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53538703-1761855867801784.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53538703-1761855867801784.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53538703-1761855867801784.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53538703-1761855867801784.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53538703-1761855867801784.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53538703-1761855867801784.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The performance is comparative between the two funds, short-term and long term.

Starting off with geopolitics, a big positive momentum has been building up with the normalization of bilateral relations with China, with the Australian Prime Minister describing the countries as <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-keen-stable-australia-ties-despite-tensions-rivalry-2025-10-27/\" rel=\"nofollow\">“friends”</a>. The ties between these countries are crucial in my opinion, as China is Australia’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_largest_trading_partners_of_Australia\" rel=\"nofollow\">biggest</a> trading partner, especially significant for crucial trading materials such as iron ore, coal, and agricultural exports. A stable relationship means a predictable economy, and a predictable economy translates to growing positive investment sentiment. Continuing on that note, we’ll focus on the materials and mining sector, as I think it will play an important part in the outlook for the ETF ahead, and even though the bulk of the ETF is invested in the Financials sector, we have to remember that this sector is cyclical and traditionally has been etching out good performance when the economy is doing well, and Australia’s economy is <a href=\"https://www.fifthquadrant.com.au/australias-economy-export-industries#:~:text=Iron%20Ore:%20The%20$138%20Billion,ripple%20directly%20through%20Australia's%20economy\" rel=\"nofollow\">dependent</a> on the metals and mining sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Australia is also poised to <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/australias-share-of-global-mined-production-and-reserves-2024\" rel=\"nofollow\">benefit</a> from the energy transition, with the country being one of the biggest players in the global mining production and reserves, especially for metals such as lithium, rare earth elements, nickel, copper and cobalt, all necessary for the clean energy supply chain and the EV transition. We can see in <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/executive-summary\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> research by IEA how crucial these metals are and their value in every technological chain, from renewable energy to electric cars. And according to the research:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>In a scenario that meets the Paris Agreement goals (as in the IEA Sustainable Development Scenario [SDS]), their share of total demand rises significantly over the next two decades to over 40% for copper and rare earth elements, 60-70% for nickel and cobalt, and almost 90% for lithium. EVs and battery storage have already displaced consumer electronics to become the largest consumer of lithium and are set to take over from stainless steel as the largest end user of nickel by 2040.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This, in my opinion, is a clear structural driver for the Australian economy, given especially the government's clear indication that it intends to boost and support this sector through the <a href=\"https://www.industry.gov.au/mining-oil-and-gas/minerals/critical-minerals\" rel=\"nofollow\">Future Made in Australia National Interest Framework.</a> The Materials sector represents around 20% of the fund’s assets, and for simplicity's sake, we won’t take into consideration the second-hand effects the sector has for the whole economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Australian dollar is traditionally a cyclical currency and moves in line with commodity demand, and in my opinion, should hold firm or appreciate in the short term as the relationship with China stabilizes and we have a risk on global sentiment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">These are all positive catalysts for the ETF in my opinion and should provide upside in the short, medium, or long term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Not All Shiny For The Land Down Under </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Continuing with the Materials sector, aside from the structural demand for critical miners, Australia remains the largest exporter of iron ore, exporting around <a href=\"https://www.worldstopexports.com/iron-ore-exports-country/\" rel=\"nofollow\">half of total iron ore exports </a>and the outlook for the ore isn’t exactly bright. Headwinds like a drop in Chinese steel production which has been falling for <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/china/steel-production\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noopener\">some months</a> now and the start of the <a href=\"https://www.riotinto.com/en/operations/projects/simandou\" rel=\"nofollow\">Simandou project</a> in Guinea is the largest unearthed iron ore reserve in the world and the increase of supply will <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-06-18/australian-iron-ore-is-less-valuable-than-used-to-be/105426072\" rel=\"nofollow\">negatively impact</a> the iron ore industry in Australia.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A similar picture is present for coal, with the IEA <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/news/global-coal-demand-to-remain-on-a-plateau-in-2025-and-2026%20\" rel=\"nofollow\">forecasting</a> coal demand to slightly increase in 2025 and decline to remain on the same level as the previous year. Interestingly, the IEA forecasts coal demand to decrease in China marginally, while demand in the US is expected to increase by 7% and to decrease in the EU by 2%. Australia is the <a href=\"https://www.iea.org/countries/australia/coal\" rel=\"nofollow\">second largest</a> exporter of coal, behind Indonesia. Last month the Australian Treasury released a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/sep/20/australias-fossil-fuel-earnings-set-to-fall-by-50bn-a-year-by-2035%20\" rel=\"nofollow\">modeling result</a> indicating that coal and gas exports are expected to decline by 50% in just five years as demand for the fossil fuels drops.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Big Four</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moving on, the biggest sector concentration for this ETF is the banking sector and the Australian banking sector is somewhat unique as four banks <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking_in_Australia\" rel=\"nofollow\">dominate</a> the whole industry. We can see that the Big Four are also dominant in this fund's assets:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53538703-17618564393094254.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"605\" height=\"250\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53538703-17618564393094254.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53538703-17618564393094254.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53538703-17618564393094254.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53538703-17618564393094254.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53538703-17618564393094254.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53538703-17618564393094254.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53538703-17618564393094254.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/53538703-17618564393094254.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Together, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CBAUF\" title=\"Commonwealth Bank of Australia\">OTCPK:CBAUF</a>), Westpac Bank Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WEBNF\" title=\"Westpac Banking Corporation\">OTCPK:WEBNF</a>), ANZ Group Holdings Limited (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ANZGF\" title=\"ANZ Group Holdings Limited\">OTCPK:ANZGF</a>) and National Australia Bank Limited (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NABZY\" title=\"National Australia Bank Limited\">OTCPK:NABZY</a>) have on their balance sheets the majority of deposits and loans. This concentrated structure has allowed them high profits, especially the last few years, as the Reserve Bank of Australia has enforced a restrictive monetary policy and high interest rates. As we know, banking is a cyclical industry, and profits are cyclical. One of the most important drivers of profit for these banks is the net interest margin. In my opinion, the <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/cash-rate-target-overview.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">cash target rate</a> set out by the RBA has hit a plateau, and even though <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/australia/inflation-cpi\" rel=\"nofollow\">inflation</a> spiked in Q3 to 3.2% compared to 2.1% in Q2, I do not think this will prompt the RBA to enforce a rate hike. Simultaneously, mortgage demand is booming, with the market being pumped by the new government initiative <a href=\"https://www.brokernews.com.au/news/breaking-news/first-home-guarantee-helps-buyers-sooner-but-at-a-cost-288126.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">First Home Guarantee</a> scheme, with a 5% deposit down for a mortgage.

The housing market is critical to the Australian economy and the banking sector, as around 60% of the loans are <a href=\"https://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2021/sp-ag-2021-09-22.html#:~:text=household%20balance%20sheets.-,Banks,to%20small%20and%20medium%20businesses\" rel=\"nofollow\">housing loans</a>.

The obvious risk also for a US friendly state in the Asian Pacific region is geopolitics, even though we see moderation in the relationship with China, any troubling noise between the US and China could find Australia in the crosshairs.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Australian capital market has had a good year so far, with positive catalysts being the improving relationship with China and the fact that Australia is a major source for some critical minerals necessary for the green transition, defense technologies, and the chip industry. The banking sector is also poised to have a good year with surging mortgage demand and with rising inflation in the last quarter proving to be a problem to the rate cut cycle. However, valuation being on the expensive side, elevated housing market risks, and the expected slowdown in demand for key exports both short term and long term, point me to a HOLD recommendation.</p>",

The company's shares surged by double-digits following the earnings release, as the market was happy about the company's<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> profitability trajectory. Relative to the more expensive Magnificent 7 stocks, AMZN looks like a solid value, but it isn't a must-own investment at a price of $250, as some other big tech players look even better.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Past Coverage</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have written about Amazon.com here on Seeking Alpha in the past, with my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4807482-amazon-post-earnings-slump-justified\">most recent article</a> being from three months ago. I gave AMZN a neutral rating back then, which worked out well so far -- on the day of the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20287289-amazon-com-announces-third-quarter-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\">Q3 release</a>, AMZN was up 3% from one quarter earlier, which is a decent return, but a little less than what investors got from the broad market. With one quarter having passed since my last article on Amazon, and with AMZN reporting its Q3 results on Thursday, it is time to update my views on the company.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Happened?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During regular trading hours, Amazon.com was down 3% on Thursday, pulling back with the broad market and the tech-heavy NASDAQ (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/QQQ\" title=\"Invesco QQQ Trust ETF\">QQQ</a>). But in after-hours trading, AMZN is up by a hefty 13% at the time of writing -- the result of the following <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511707-amazon-gaap-eps-of-1_95-beats-by-0_39-revenue-of-180_2b-beats-by-2_44b\">earnings release</a>:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/28873105-17618604269745526.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Amazon.com Q3 earnings release\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"617\" height=\"111\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/28873105-17618604269745526.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/28873105-17618604269745526.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/28873105-17618604269745526.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/28873105-17618604269745526.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/28873105-17618604269745526.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/28873105-17618604269745526.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/28873105-17618604269745526.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/28873105-17618604269745526.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Amazon.com Q3 earnings release <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We see that AMZN beat estimates on both lines, which is always a good thing. The revenue beat wasn't very large, at roughly 1%, but earnings per share trounced estimates, with AMZN's bottom-line number coming in 25% ahead of what Wall Street analysts were forecasting -- AMZN hit the highest analyst estimate perfectly. This was Amazon's fifth double beat in a row, but it was the biggest profit beat in absolute terms, which could explain why investors were so happy with AMZN's earnings report, although I believe that Amazon's consolidating share price in the recent past may also help explain the positive reaction -- the market didn't seem very enthusiastic about Amazon going into this earnings report.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon.com: Strong Profitability</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon's company-wide revenue growth of 13% was appealing, I believe. After all, Amazon's gigantic revenues in absolute terms make it quite hard to maintain a very high relative growth rate -- considering this, I think that the 13% revenue increase is very solid, even though tech peers like Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) and Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META\" title=\"Meta Platforms, Inc.\">META</a>) have reported better relative growth for the third quarter. During the second quarter, revenues had grown by 13% as well, thus we can say that there is neither significant positive nor significant negative momentum on a company-wide scale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon's business is split into three main sections, which can differ quite a lot when it comes to growth, profitability, etc. Amazon's biggest unit in terms of revenue generation is the U.S. retail business, where around 60% of company-wide revenue is being generated. The U.S. business grew by 11%, relative to one year earlier, which was in line with the growth rate one quarter earlier -- no big surprise here. The international business grew a little faster, at 14% versus the previous year's quarter, which is partially due to a weakening U.S. Dollar -- on a currency-neutral basis, the international segment grew by 10%, which is more or less in line with the U.S. business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon's growth star, of course, is AWS: During the third quarter, the unit saw sales expand to $33 billion, which made for a 20% increase versus one year earlier. Considering this is now a ~$130 billion a year tech unit, a 20% annual growth rate seems quite compelling to me. Here, we also saw positive momentum: AWS's growth rate was 18% during the second quarter, thus, growth did not only remain strong, it actually accelerated. That bodes well for the current quarter and 2026, I think, assuming Amazon can maintain positive momentum. Since AWS offers some AI exposure, the ongoing AI trend/hype seems to have a positive impact on Amazon's highest-margin business.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenue growth is good, but investors want to see profits, of course. Here, Amazon did well, too -- at least if we correct Amazon's reported numbers for some one-time items. Operating profit was $17.4 billion for the third quarter, in line with one year earlier. But that was due to two one-time items that \"hide\" Amazon's underlying profit growth. The company settled a legal issue with the FTC, which cost $2.5 billion, and the company experienced a charge of $1.8 billion for the planned massive layoffs that were announced a couple of days ago. Backing out those two items, Amazon would have generated an operating profit of $21.7 billion, which would mean growth of 25% versus one year earlier. Not only is that a pretty nice growth rate in general, it also means that AMZN's margins expanded nicely -- the operating profit growth rate was almost twice as high as the revenue growth rate.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This was, not surprisingly, partially driven by growing AWS profits, but Amazon's retail business did well, too. Backing out the aforementioned charge, the U.S. business (which is more profitable than the international business) saw profits expand by $1.6 billion over the last year. Low fuel expenses due to low oil prices helped with profitability, but Amazon also benefited from operating leverage that results in margin expansion as the company expands, all else equal. Amazon's AWS profits were up by $1.0 billion, before accounting for layoff expenses, which were not broken down on a business unit basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net income was impacted by the above charges to operating earnings, but also saw a one-time impact from Amazon's stake in AI company Anthropic becoming more valuable -- AMZN booked a $9.5 billion pre-tax gain in Q3, which helps explain how Amazon was able to beat profit estimates so easily.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Amazon's operations are capital-intensive, both for the retail business -- warehouses, trucks, etc. -- as well as for the tech business, where huge data center investments are needed. With Artificial Intelligence investing picking up at AMZN, as well as at its peers, capital expenditures rose substantially over the last year. That's why free cash flows declined, despite operating cash flows improving: Operating cash flows over the last twelve months totaled $131 billion, up 16% over the previous year, but due to capital expenditures of $116 billion over the last year, free cash flow declined to only $15 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For a company that is valued at roughly $2.7 trillion, that's not a lot -- the trailing free cash flow multiple is 180 or so. One can argue that capital expenditures will not always remain this high, and that major AI and data center investments will result in better operating cash flow and profits down the road, but I think that the discrepancy between the company's free cash flows and its market capitalization shouldn't be completely ignored by AMZN bulls.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Is Amazon A Good Investment?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The valuation looks better when we focus on profits instead of free cash flows, but even then, Amazon isn't a bargain. The company is forecasted to earn $6.65 or so this year, with shares trading at around $250 following the earnings release -- this makes for a 38x earnings multiple. Even when we account for some earnings estimate upside revisions in the coming days following AMZN's Q3 earnings beat, the valuation will remain in the mid-to-high-30s. That's not expensive compared to where Nvidia (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA\" title=\"NVIDIA Corporation\">NVDA</a>), Advanced Micro Devices (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>), or Tesla (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA\" title=\"Tesla, Inc.\">TSLA</a>) are trading -- but Magnificent 7 peers Meta Platforms and Alphabet are considerably cheaper, despite growing even faster than Amazon.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That is why I'm not an AMZN bull at current prices: With cheaper, faster-growing tech giants with AI exposure available today, I see more value elsewhere -- that doesn't mean that AMZN is a bad company at all, just that it is a less opportune investment compared to alternatives.</p>",

I was impressed by several key items on Microsoft's report, particularly:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>The largest EPS beat and third-largest revenue beat vs. expectations <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT/earnings\">in the past 20 quarters</a>.</li> <li>The largest YOY growth rate in the two segments that matter most, business processes and cloud, going back at least nine quarters.</li> <li>An Azure business that, rather than maturing and slowing down, seems to be accelerating (see chart below).</li> <li>Strong op margin expansion (48.9% in the recent quarter vs. 46.6% in the comparable period last year) that was clearly driven by scale, as gross margins did not pick up any tailwind, but operating expenses (particularly sales and marketing) remained well under control.</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/40779175-1761848660967248_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"887\" data-height=\"570\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/40779175-1761848660967248_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bar Chart, YOY Change in Azure Growth (in pct pts)\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"411\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/40779175-1761848660967248_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/40779175-1761848660967248_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/40779175-1761848660967248_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/40779175-1761848660967248_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/40779175-1761848660967248_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/40779175-1761848660967248_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/40779175-1761848660967248_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/40779175-1761848660967248_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>DM Martins Research</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that the last point above flies under many investors' radars, yet it helps to justify my bull thesis on the company and stock. As the chart below clearly depicts, Microsoft has managed to deliver operating profits as consistently and predictably as one could expect. This is the result, in my view, of Microsoft's transition to what is now mostly a SaaS- and subscription-based business model under the leadership of Satya Nadella.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I wrote in a Microsoft article that is now about seven years old, \"recurring revenue offers revenue predictability\" and \"the stock market [...] places a higher value on predictable recurring revenue as it translates into meaningful valuation.\" Yes, Microsoft's F1Q was impressive as a stand-alone quarter. But more importantly, it helped to cement the idea that the company, even at a massive scale, can still deliver what I believe to be what investors value the most: predictable, high-margin, cash-flow-rich results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a perfect segue to the next topic, my perma-bull thesis on MSFT.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c6496acf11b642f8a7061ad5f368ae65.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c6496acf11b642f8a7061ad5f368ae65.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c6496acf11b642f8a7061ad5f368ae65.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c6496acf11b642f8a7061ad5f368ae65.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c6496acf11b642f8a7061ad5f368ae65.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c6496acf11b642f8a7061ad5f368ae65.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c6496acf11b642f8a7061ad5f368ae65.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c6496acf11b642f8a7061ad5f368ae65.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_c6496acf11b642f8a7061ad5f368ae65.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Perma-bull Thesis On MSFT</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Microsoft is one of those businesses that I have never turned bearish on, once I understood the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4183655-microsoft-this-might-turn-me-into-a-bull\">value proposition</a> in 2018. This is not to say that I am blind to the risks of investing in the company's equity (although, to be fair, <a href=\"https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&amp;sl=5AFRBwkrg6O9mQ3k9o7jZE\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSFT has historically been the least volatile stock</a> of all within the Mag 7 peer group). It also does not mean that I would never abandon my bull thesis as a matter of loyalty to the company or my convictions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I presented several times in the past, value perception is primarily a function of two factors above any other: risk and growth. On the risk side, the chart immediately above provides a visual representation of how consistently at delivering results, Microsoft has been for many years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a> also helps to support the case. As of the most recent period, Microsoft held nearly $60 billion in net cash, defined here as cash and liquid investments less short- and long-term debt. This is in part why the company can so easily afford to invest in infrastructure to ride the tailwinds of the cloud and AI revolutions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, Microsoft's net working capital (current assets except cash, minus current liabilities except debt) is -$40 billion (net liability positive), which is astounding when coupled with cash flow from operations of $147 billion in the trailing twelve months. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4727705-apple-stock-return-on-invested-capital-producing-massive-amounts-value\">Not unlike its peer</a> Apple (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>), this means that Microsoft is able to create lavish amounts of cash \"out of thin air\" — that is, while having its operations financed primarily by its customers and vendors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3f08112b8b4c71faf55c5d33251ef1ce.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3f08112b8b4c71faf55c5d33251ef1ce.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3f08112b8b4c71faf55c5d33251ef1ce.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3f08112b8b4c71faf55c5d33251ef1ce.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3f08112b8b4c71faf55c5d33251ef1ce.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3f08112b8b4c71faf55c5d33251ef1ce.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3f08112b8b4c71faf55c5d33251ef1ce.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3f08112b8b4c71faf55c5d33251ef1ce.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_3f08112b8b4c71faf55c5d33251ef1ce.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The growth side of the valuation equation is what I believe more clearly supports my bullish stance. While MSFT's trailing EPS multiple of 38.3x (see above) may keep value investors at bay, merely looking forward a couple of years helps to understand why the share price is likely to grow into a next-year P/E that currently sits at \"only\" 28.7x. With fiscal 2028 P/E at 24.3x today, one of two things must be true: either (1) Microsoft will disappoint analysts and investors and deliver below-consensus EPS going forward, which the company virtually never does, or (2) MSFT stock will more than likely climb towards an EPS valuation above 30x through the next 2–3 years, which is much more reasonable for a stock of this quality.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the reasons outlined above, I maintain my perma-bull stance on MSFT. While a 3% single-session pullback may not be enough to call this a dip-buying opportunity, it is better than nothing: I am accumulating shares on this modest pullback.</p>",

Record revenues of $102.47 billion (+7.9% year-over-year) and earnings per share of $1.85 (estimated at $1.77). It was the best September quarter in the company's history, driven by double-digit growth in services (+15%) and a significant recovery in the Mac (+13%), while the iPhone maintained a solid pace of expansion (+6%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606959998257_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1038\" data-height=\"704\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606959998257_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Apple\" width=\"640\" height=\"434\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606959998257_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606959998257_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606959998257_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606959998257_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606959998257_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606959998257_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606959998257_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606959998257_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Apple</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The main driver was the <em>services segment</em>, which added $28.75 billion in revenue, an all-time high thanks to the expansion of the App Store, Google licenses, AppleCare, and digital subscriptions. The CFO specified that growth was double-digit in almost all categories and regions. Here, in addition to highlighting revenues, I'd like to focus on the stability of margins; in fact, the gross margin exceeded expectations thanks to the growing weight of services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606467203033_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1038\" data-height=\"524\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606467203033_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Agar Capital\" width=\"640\" height=\"323\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606467203033_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606467203033_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606467203033_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606467203033_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606467203033_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606467203033_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606467203033_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606467203033_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Agar Capital</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <em>Wearables, Home, and Accessories</em> categories also performed strongly, totaling $9 billion and beating estimates by $8.6 billion. Demand for the AirPods Pro 3 and Apple Watch SE, which had remained flat for several quarters, has indeed returned. The CFO reported $1.1 billion in tariff costs in the quarter, a figure that explains why operating expenses (+11% year-over-year) rose more than expected. Yet, they did not impact profitability, further demonstrating how Apple manages to defend margins even in unfavorable geopolitical environments.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The sore point remains the same. The Achilles heel that once accounted for 20% of revenues has now fallen to around 15%. China, the company's third-largest market. This is not the first time we have seen it, yet it is a really unstable market, therefore results in that area frequently decide income. Apple has fallen today in that region. Revenue decreased 3.6% to $14.5 billion, some 12% below analysts' estimates. I believe that while the weight of rivalry was felt, limitations on AI characteristics (not accessible in the nation) also had detrimental consequences. These statistics caused the market to initiate the selloff I previously described, therefore erasing $130 billion in market capitalization within minutes (or seconds).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In any case, I don't believe this is a structural weakness, but rather a temporary effect. Some iPhone 16 and 17 models are still limited by production capacity (management itself has confirmed this), and this explains much of the slowdown in sales. So it's not a question of demand, but of availability, and I believe that in this case, it's better to have a production constraint than a loss of market share. Don't you think so?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"960\" data-height=\"558\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Agar Capital\" width=\"640\" height=\"372\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606604701216_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Agar Capital</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's worth noting, however, that the $1.9 billion decline in sales in China was more than offset, in absolute terms, by sales exceeding $2.3 billion in Europe. This, combined with the CEO's guidance, may be why the stock recovered from the initial shock of the Chinese results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Indeed, CEO Tim Cook, during the conference call, expressed confidence in a \"return to growth in the holiday quarter\" and highlighted record results in India, which recorded its best quarter ever. According to forecasts, Apple therefore expects growth of 10% to 12% in the quarter ending in December, with iPhone sales experiencing \"double-digit growth\" (the consensus was around +8%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cook also mentioned the $600 billion investment plan in the United States over the next four years, in an attempt to approximate President Trump's model of bringing manufacturing back home while protecting the supply chain.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606682427776_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"924\" data-height=\"508\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606682427776_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Agar Capital\" width=\"640\" height=\"352\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606682427776_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606682427776_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606682427776_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606682427776_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606682427776_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606682427776_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606682427776_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618606682427776_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Agar Capital</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On the cost front, expenses have remained under control and cash remains abundant at $132 billion, strengthening financial visibility for buybacks and AI investments.

Operationally, the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL/balance-sheet\">balance sheet</a> remains solid, but I had no doubts about that. Gross margins rose above expectations, operating costs remained under control, and the company continued to aggressively return capital (approximately $90.7 billion in buybacks this year) while keeping the dividend stable at $0.26 per share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1004\" data-height=\"448\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Agar Capital, Bloomberg\" width=\"640\" height=\"286\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-1761862500995549_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Agar Capital, Bloomberg</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gross cash (cash and short-term securities) is $132 billion in gross cash, meaning there's virtually no need for leverage for any type of investment.

They can continue to return capital to shareholders—and do so aggressively, with record buybacks—without having to sacrifice strategic investments in AI. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The 10–12% <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511434-apple-slips-as-iphone-china-sales-fall-short-in-q4\">growth target</a> for the December quarter sounds believable to me and, in my view, draws emphasis away from geographic volatility—the \"China case,\" Apple's problem) to margin resilience and the more lucrative service mix, which is expanding in double digits. Personally, I am rather unconcerned about the (temporary) China problem—particularly if it's connected to supply restrictions (rather than demand) and if sales in Europe, Japan, and APAC compensate well.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Rating Update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I​‍​‌‍​‍‌ am not trying to follow the trend of the market. I pass from Buy to Strong Buy. I had already gone the other way, in fact, at one point, I gave it a Sell rating. I was mistaken, I acknowledged it, and I am acknowledging it once again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The recent figures have removed a large part of the doubts that I had. To summarize, demand is stable, margins are solid, and management is working hard, raising the next quarter's ​‍​‌‍​‍‌forecasts.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What really changes the situation, for me, are services. They are the engine that brings stability and visibility to Apple's financials. They are growing at a double-digit rate in almost all regions, with margins above 70%. Truly interesting.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And then, show me another company that generates around $100 billion in free cash flow each year, with $132 billion in gross cash, and still absorbs over $1 billion in tariff costs without affecting margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On artificial intelligence, I have flip-flipped. A few quarters back I was very skeptical and critical; Apple appears to have made no headway. I wrote it and I shall say it once again. I was not right. The new partnerships outside ChatGPT and the redesigned Siri in 2026 finally offer a believable path toward artificial intelligence's monetization inside the Apple ecosystem. And I'm drawn to that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given its enormous visibility and cash flow, Apple is not pricey at present <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL/valuation/metrics\">price/earnings levels</a>, but it is also not inexpensive either. Should China grow again and if first AI monetization comes, the potential upside results are huge.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"885\" data-height=\"496\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha\" width=\"640\" height=\"359\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/55096224-17618625466213288_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After a quarter like this, the risk isn't buying too early, but staying out. I've made this mistake in the past by reducing my exposure to the stock, thinking I was outsmarting the market and playing for timing. Today, the story is different. Apple has returned to being a story to hold, not to chase. The market was confused after the data was released, but as soon as it had time to better understand the financial data, it shifted toward buying. Margins are solid, services are expanding, and AI is starting to become tangible.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my portfolio, Apple has become a core stock, like in the old days. You purchase on drawdowns and let it work. Because the mix of FCF, cash, and earnings visibility successfully covers the valuation premium, I don't see the risk of multiple compression in the near term.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMG\" title=\"Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.\">CMG</a></span>). Shares of the company plummeted 18.2% after management <a href=\"https://ir.chipotle.com/2025-10-29-CHIPOTLE-ANNOUNCES-THIRD-QUARTER-2025-RESULTS\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.chipotle.com/2025-10-29-CHIPOTLE-ANNOUNCES-THIRD-QUARTER-2025-RESULTS\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> financial results covering the third quarter of the company's 2025 fiscal year. Revenue fell a<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> bit short of expectations. But earnings per share came in line with what analysts were anticipating. More disappointing than these results, however, was the fact that management reduced guidance for comparable store sales for this year because of consumer headwinds. In the past, I have been more neutral on the business, </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4752475-chipotle-mexican-grill-great-for-tastebuds-not-wallet\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4752475-chipotle-mexican-grill-great-for-tastebuds-not-wallet\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">even reaffirming it</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> as a \"Hold\" candidate back in January of this year. The fact of the matter is that shares were too expensive for my liking, even though I am a huge fan of the restaurant. However, the thing that stopped me from downgrading it to a \"Sell\" was the fact that the company was continuing to achieve impressive growth.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fast forward to today, and things are not going well. The stock is down 45.6% over the last year, with management now warning that comparable restaurant sales will be down this year as opposed to flat. For many investors, this would be an ideal time to cash out and look elsewhere for opportunities. However, I actually think now might be the time to step in and upgrade it. To be clear, the company has difficult days ahead for it, and I fully expect conditions to worsen before they get better. The U<span>nited States</span> is spiraling toward a recession, in my opinion, and I fully anticipate consumer pressures to hurt the company more than they have already. Normally, the kind of valuation that the firm trades at would justify a neutral rating, though just barely. But with the company still focused tremendously on growth and with it having no debt and a huge amount of cash on hand, I think that those who are in it for the long haul should consider it a very soft \"Buy\" candidate.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Tough Times</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After the market closed on Oct. 29, the management team at Chipotle Mexican Grill announced financial results covering the third quarter of the company's 2025 fiscal year. Revenue for the company came in at $3 billion, which was up from the $2.79 billion reported last year, but it also ended up missing analysts’ <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMG/earnings\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CMG/earnings\" target=\"_blank\">expectations</a> by $19.1 million. In the grand scheme of things, this kind of miss is mostly a rounding error. However, when you have a restaurant operator that has historically been priced like a technology company, even meeting expectations can result in downside if the market catches even a whiff of weakness ahead. In short, Chipotle Mexican Grill has been priced for perfection, and it has fallen short of that.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2226\" data-height=\"854\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"246\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"246\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618579939925349_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The overall growth in revenue for the company came from a rise in the number of locations that it has in operation, from 3,615 last year to 3,916 this year. There was also a slight increase in comparable store sales, amounting to 0.3%. But that's far worse than the 6% increase that the company saw in the same quarter last year on a year-over-year basis. What was really problematic is the fact that the comparable store sales for the company were driven entirely by higher prices, with the average check rising by 1.1%.

But the second investment book that I ever read was One Up On Wall Street by Peter Lynch. In that book, I became fascinated by the fact that he would often physically check in on the companies that he was considering buying to get a full understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the business in person. Keeping in mind that a single visit to a single location does not offer significant value if our goal is to get an understanding of the health of the business as a whole, I would like to mention that just a month ago, I visited one of the Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants near my home. I am a big fan of its food, and I consider myself a foodie. I was shocked when, probably around 1:00 PM, I walked in and was the only customer for the business to service. The number of employees seemed low, and honestly, the food was not as fresh as it should have been.

Management continues to focus on innovations, including those involving its menu and investing in digital orders. In fact, the firm went from generating 34% of its food and beverage sales through digital means in the third quarter of last year to generating 36.7% of them at the same time this year. I think the bigger problem is precisely what management hit on, which is that consumer headwinds and macroeconomic challenges remain a problem.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1518\" data-height=\"1008\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Confidence\" width=\"640\" height=\"425\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"425\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857728523995_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Federal Reserve</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's be honest: when it comes to food, Chipotle Mexican Grill is not the go-to place if your goal is to maintain a strict budget. It's the place that you go to if you want food that is of a higher quality and don't mind paying a little bit more than what fast food joints would charge you. During difficult times, I would imagine that Chipotle Mexican Grill would struggle. As I have detailed in other articles, like <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829256-trump-100-percent-tariff-on-china-may-cause-economy-to-spiral-toward-recession\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829256-trump-100-percent-tariff-on-china-may-cause-economy-to-spiral-toward-recession\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4808493-a-recession-is-coming-are-you-prepared\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4808493-a-recession-is-coming-are-you-prepared\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>, the U.S. economy seems to be heading toward a recession. Jobs data is getting worse almost by the month. And with tariffs now at play, there is a real risk of economic contraction in the near future. I have been arguing this since August. It is the first time in my professional career that I have ever said a recession is practically guaranteed. Even consumer confidence is near an all-time low, as the <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UMCSENT\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UMCSENT\" target=\"_blank\">chart</a> above illustrates.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1948\" data-height=\"898\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Costs\" width=\"640\" height=\"295\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"295\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-1761857770909105_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even though revenue for the company increased, the profitability worsened. Earnings per share did rise from $0.28 to $0.29. But that was only thanks to a change in share count. Overall net income grew from $387.4 million to $382.1 million. In the chart above, you can see important costs in relation to overall revenue. The good news is that food, beverage, and packaging expenses have actually gotten a bit better for the company. But other costs are on the rise, including labor expenses and occupancy costs. The big problem, however, seems to be its <span>\"</span>other operating costs,\" which rose from 13.83% of sales to 15%. Management blamed this on increased marketing and promotional activities and lower sales volumes. Fortunately, as the first chart in this article illustrates, cash flow metrics for the business at least improved.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2266\" data-height=\"852\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Financials\" width=\"640\" height=\"241\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"241\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578003183048_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the chart above, you can see financial results for the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same time last year. In this case, results did improve across the board. But overall, the company remains challenged. So far, comparable restaurant sales this year are down 1.4%, even though the company benefited to the tune of 1.3% from higher prices. But again, consumer confidence is incredibly weak right now, and even small price increases can have an impact on traffic. In fact, the number of transactions that the company saw was down 2.7% year over year. Until economic conditions improve or until management can do something to draw more customers into its doors, such as effective promotions, menu cost reductions, or new and innovative offerings at its restaurants, I expect worsening economic conditions to lead to more of this pain as time goes on.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Management has even had to reduce guidance for this year. Earlier in the year, they anticipated that overall comparable restaurant sales would be mostly flat. But now they expect them to be down at a low single-digit rate. Despite this, the company is pushing forward with its growth plans. It still intends to open between 315 and 345 locations this year, with 80% of those boasting a Chipotlane. According to some <a href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/chipotle-starbucks-mcdonalds-quick-restaurants-drive-throughs-3d7ac4f0\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/chipotle-starbucks-mcdonalds-quick-restaurants-drive-throughs-3d7ac4f0\" target=\"_blank\">estimates</a>, a Chipotlane typically boosts overall restaurant sales by between 10% and 15%, also leading to greater margins and overall returns. So it is great to see investments being made in these.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Next year, management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835032-chipotle-mexican-grill-inc-cmg-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835032-chipotle-mexican-grill-inc-cmg-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">intends</a> to push growth even further, opening between 350 and 370 locations. That will involve between 10 and 15 international locations as the company continues to focus on a population that is drastically larger than what the U<span>nited States</span> consists of. This does not mean that the company will slow down its growth in North America anytime soon. In fact, management expects to eventually expand its physical footprint to 7,000 restaurants in North America.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1794\" data-height=\"904\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Trading Multiples\" width=\"640\" height=\"322\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"322\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/9866571-17618578150213459_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Author - SEC EDGAR Data</span></p></figcaption></figure> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This kind of growth justifies, in my view, the stock as a very soft \"Buy\" rating at this time. If we project our results based on what we have seen already this year, we would expect net profits of $1.54 billion, adjusted operating cash flow of $2.14 billion, and EBITDA of $2.32 billion. Using these estimates, we can see in the chart above how shares of the company are currently valued. Relative to what the company was valued at using data from last year, shares are a bit cheaper. But not radically so. The stock is certainly cheaper than it was when I last wrote about it. And now, as you can tell by looking at the table below, it is priced around the middle of what other similar enterprises are priced at. Considering its growth trajectory and potential, and adding on top of this the fact that it has no debt and has $698.7 million of cash on its books, I think that there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td><strong>Company</strong></td> <td><strong>Price/Earnings</strong></td> <td><strong>Price/Operating Cash Flow</strong></td> <td><strong>EV/EBITDA</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Chipotle Mexican Grill</strong></td> <td><strong>29.7</strong></td> <td><strong>21.3</strong></td> <td><strong>19.4</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Starbucks (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SBUX\" title=\"Starbucks Corporation\">SBUX</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>36.2</strong></td> <td><strong>19.4</strong></td> <td><strong>21.8</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>The Cheesecake Factory (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CAKE\" title=\"The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated\">CAKE</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>15.1</strong></td> <td><strong>7.8</strong></td> <td><strong>12.8</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Shake Shack (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SHAK\" title=\"Shake Shack Inc.\">SHAK</a>)</strong></td> <td><strong>196.0</strong></td> <td><strong>20.6</strong></td> <td><strong>23.7</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Dutch Bros.

The CEF comes from BlackRock and focuses on leveraged loans.</p> <p>In today's<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> article we are going to review this CEF, its structure and analytics, and outline why we believe the fund to have significant downside in the next 12 months given the current macro outlook and fund internals.</span></p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fund composition - leveraged loans</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FRA is a classic leveraged loans closed end fund:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Term loans: 95%</li> <li>Equity: 4%</li> <li>CLO: 1%</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The name holds mostly leveraged loans outright, with a small sleeve for equity (from restructurings) and a small CLO sleeve. The name is overweight single-B credits which make up the majority of the holdings:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>BBB: 6%</li> <li>BB: 29%</li> <li>B: 57%</li> <li>CCC: 5%</li> <li>Not rated: 3%</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The composition is fairly typical for a leveraged loan CEF, with a 22% gearing ratio on top. So far, so good. The fund has a granular build, with the vast majority of the holdings under 1% of the fund (only 6 names represent more than 1%, with the maximum concentration at 1.9%).</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Historic performance - in line with peers</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The CEF does not have an outstanding historic performance, its total return falling in line with peers:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_b865901e6914d5e1f1ad5efd6371b1af.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_b865901e6914d5e1f1ad5efd6371b1af.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_b865901e6914d5e1f1ad5efd6371b1af.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_b865901e6914d5e1f1ad5efd6371b1af.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_b865901e6914d5e1f1ad5efd6371b1af.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_b865901e6914d5e1f1ad5efd6371b1af.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_b865901e6914d5e1f1ad5efd6371b1af.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_b865901e6914d5e1f1ad5efd6371b1af.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_b865901e6914d5e1f1ad5efd6371b1af.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On a 5-year lookback FRA has posted a total return profile that closely correlates with VVR and JFR. This simply means that the management team has done a similar job as their peers. We can observe that until recently only VVR was the outperformer from this cohort. However, in the past year FRA has outperformed both VVR and JFR. We will explore shortly why, in the Premium/Discount section.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Premium/Discount to NAV</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FRA has outperformed its peers this year, not due to outstanding management decisions, but the market perception of its peers:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_e15527e46b25d0a82e243bdee632de2d.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">JFR and VVR seem to have a bigger retail investor base, base which started pricing in lower Fed Funds and the changing macro environment. FRA has lagged in doing so, with the CEF still at an astounding premium to NAV of 2.3%. We are of the opinion this state of affairs will change, with the CEF set to move to a discount as the market prices correctly the current macro.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since historically FRA does not show any alpha to its peers, it is set to being valued similarly, i.e. at a discount. We shall show you the macro drivers responsible for this.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Macro drivers: lower fed funds and tight spreads</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Leveraged loans are floating rate, meaning they pay SOFR plus a spread. As Fed Funds move lower, SOFR moves lower, hence the all-in yield paid by leveraged loans decreases. What does this mean? It means in such an environment investors tend to move away from floating rate assets into fixed rate assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On October 29, 2025 the Fed <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/10/30/fed-cuts-key-rate-yet-powell-says-future-reductions-are-not-locked-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">cut</a> rates yet again, bringing the effective Fed Funds target rate to 3.75%-4%:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/saupload_197d8a0011552b82447f85b7162f7364.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors can debate where the neutral rate lies, but one thing is certain: rates are moving lower. Is the neutral rate 3% or is it 2%? One can debate this for a while, but at the end of the day SOFR is headed lower, and all-in yields for leveraged loans are headed lower.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The second macro headwind for leveraged loans is made up of tight credit spreads. We have compressed to a level in spreads that is at the bottom of a 10-year range. This simply means the market is very complacent, and during a risk-off event spreads are headed higher. Higher spreads means lower prices for leveraged loans, which means a lower NAV for a fund like FRA. While we do not have a crystal ball to predict the exact timing, it will eventually happen in the next 12 months. It is just a matter of time.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current dividend is unsustainable</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The CEF is currently paying a 11.88% distribution, but this level is unsustainable:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"646\" data-height=\"297\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"section\" width=\"640\" height=\"294\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/48943276-17618243448284526_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Section 19a <span>(Company)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even before the most recent Fed action, the CEF was paying out an unsustained dividend. As we can see from its August 2025 Section 19a notice, the CEF was using 32% return of capital. This is a very large figure that will become larger as lower rates percolate down the holdings. Please note many leveraged loans are set off 3-months SOFR, meaning a lower Fed Funds level will take a few months to translate into a lower all-in yield. It is coming however.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Using the above 32% ROC figure gives us an actual cash supported distribution of below 9%. That level will be cemented by lower Fed Funds. Math points towards a cut in the distribution rate to make it more sustainable. We see the fund moving to a 9% or 10% distribution rate in the next few months, thus still using ROC but a lower amount of it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors hate distribution cuts, and we believe that is why we have not seen this yet happen, but the management team will not have a choice.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FRA is a leveraged loan CEF. The name is negatively impacted by lower Fed Funds, and has an overhang in terms of tight credit spreads. Surprisingly the CEF is still trading at a premium to NAV while its peers are at discounts close to -10%. The fund's distribution is not supported, with the latest Fed cut suggesting a supported cash distribution closer to 9%. We are of the opinion that the CEF will end up cutting its distribution and moving to a discount to NAV, thus putting pressure on its price.</p>",
