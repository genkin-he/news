Here is a quote from the prospectus of ECCV:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>\"We are required under current law to have an asset coverage of at least 300%, as measured at the time of borrowing and calculated as the ratio of our total assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) over the aggregate amount of our outstanding senior securities representing indebtedness. With respect to senior securities that are stocks (i.e., shares of our Preferred Stock), we are required under current law to have an asset coverage of at least 200%, as measured at the time of the issuance of any such shares of preferred stock and calculated as the ratio of our total assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) over the aggregate amount of our outstanding senior securities representing indebtedness plus the aggregate liquidation preference of any outstanding shares of preferred stock.\"</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We are facing a lot of questions about yield calculations, and we calculate them using the XIRR function in Google Sheets, which is supposed to be the most precise way when dealing with ex-dividend dates. It is a bit more work than just finding a random bond yield calculator, but at least we try to ensure the data is accurate. Below you can see ECCV's yields to maturity at different prices:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/30934865-1761647769610727_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1124\" data-height=\"551\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/30934865-1761647769610727_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"ECCV's prices vs yields to maturity\" width=\"640\" height=\"314\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/30934865-1761647769610727_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/30934865-1761647769610727_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/30934865-1761647769610727_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/30934865-1761647769610727_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/30934865-1761647769610727_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/30934865-1761647769610727_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/30934865-1761647769610727_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/30934865-1761647769610727_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">ECCV's prices vs yields to maturity <span>(author's database)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For ECCV to trade at 7.19%, like its sibling ECCX, it would have to trade at a price nearly 80 cents higher than it is now (or close to 3.4%).

The stock is up ~2% since earnings, which is notable when most of the sector is down double-digits in sympathy with Chipotle's horrendous print.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_42afec930bf688e6f3c050aee72f605b.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_42afec930bf688e6f3c050aee72f605b.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_42afec930bf688e6f3c050aee72f605b.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_42afec930bf688e6f3c050aee72f605b.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_42afec930bf688e6f3c050aee72f605b.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_42afec930bf688e6f3c050aee72f605b.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_42afec930bf688e6f3c050aee72f605b.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_42afec930bf688e6f3c050aee72f605b.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_42afec930bf688e6f3c050aee72f605b.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4808314-shake-shack-excellent-cost-management-offset-by-stubbornly-low-traffic\">I last wrote a neutral article</a> on Shake Shack in August, when the stock was trading near $110 per share. Since then, Shake Shack has seen a ~20% correction, while its metrics have only improved: showcasing accelerating comp sales and superb cost management when most of the rest of the industry has faced declining comp sales and a surge in pressure from labor costs and food inflation. I'm biting the bullet here and upgrading Shake Shack to a <strong>buy </strong>rating.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my view, there are now many reasons to be positive on Shake Shack. The core tenets of the bull case for this company are:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li> <strong>Category leader with a reputation for quality. </strong>Shake Shack's roots trace back to Michelin-starred chef Danny Meyer, and the company has since earned a reputation as a gourmet burger at a fast-casual price. The company has a massive white space for expansion in the U.S. I also think that while rivals like McDonald's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD\" title=\"McDonald's Corporation\">MCD</a>) are trying to win back traffic by focusing on price, Shake Shack has an opportunity to distinguish itself for quality.</li> <li> <strong>Licensing deals and overseas growth position Shake Shack for tremendous expansion beyond the core domestic market. </strong>The Shake Shack brand is beloved in the U.S., and the company is beginning to capitalize on this by expanding into franchise deals overseas. Licensing revenue is growing at a &gt;20% y/y clip, nearly double the company average and providing a high-margin revenue stream for the company.</li> <li> <strong>Substantial progress in bringing down labor costs. </strong>Shake Shack is achieving substantial operating margin improvement despite a tough and inflationary economy, in which most of its peers are facing deleverage on labor costs. The company's new labor staffing model has allowed it to shave down significant costs on store labor, padding its earnings growth despite more tepid same-store sales performance. We think more machine-based automation (such as Chipotle's Autocado) could be a further catalyst down the line for the company's back-kitchen processes.</li> <li> <strong>Managing inflating costs well. </strong>Though the price of beef has increased in the double digits, the company notes that it has achieved deflation on other costs, helping the company to reduce the bite of inflation by Q4 of this year.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And while I think it still may be a stretch to call Shake Shack a value stock, I do think that its \"port in the storm\" performance amid a tougher quarter for the rest of the industry, plus its recent downside from August peaks, have positioned the stock well for gains.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At current share prices near $91, Shake Shack trades at a market cap of $3.90 billion. After we net off the $357.8 million of cash and $247.5 million of debt on Shake Shack's latest balance sheet, the company's resulting <strong>enterprise value is $3.79 billion.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For next year, FY26, Wall Street analysts are expecting Shake Shack to hit $1.65 billion in revenue, or 13% y/y growth. The company notes it is planning to open 55-60 new Shacks next year (15-16% unit growth versus the ~375 stores it will end FY25 with, based on a range of 15-20 openings in Q4). If we conservatively assume the company achieves ~100 bps of y/y adjusted EBITDA margin expansion next year to a 15.7% margin (the company has been improving restaurant-level margins at close to a ~2 point pace in recent quarters), adjusted EBITDA in FY26 would be $259.1 million, or ~21% y/y growth. This positions Shake Shack at a <strong>14.6x EV/FY26 adjusted EBITDA multiple. </strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, with proven strong execution amid a tough macro climate, Shake Shack fares quite well from a value/growth perspective against other restaurant peers. Shake Shack is trading in line/below Chipotle, despite the latter's growth challenges and its nearly nonexistent comp sales growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_54184e38844e81806b24fc14fafcb616.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_54184e38844e81806b24fc14fafcb616.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_54184e38844e81806b24fc14fafcb616.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_54184e38844e81806b24fc14fafcb616.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_54184e38844e81806b24fc14fafcb616.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_54184e38844e81806b24fc14fafcb616.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_54184e38844e81806b24fc14fafcb616.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_54184e38844e81806b24fc14fafcb616.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_54184e38844e81806b24fc14fafcb616.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To me, it's time to pick up shares of Shake Shack while it's strengthening its hand against a flailing restaurant industry.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 recap</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's now go through Shake Shack's latest quarterly results in greater detail.

Of course, all eyes are fixed on Shake Shack's comp sales trends. In Q3, Shake Shack surprised industry watchers by achieving a 3-point reaccelerating to 5% comp sales growth. Even more surprising is that traffic rebounded to 1% expansion, after three quarters of negative traffic. We note that comp sales accelerated in all of Shake Shack's domestic markets, while also hitting positive growth in all markets except its home base of New York City.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2026\" data-height=\"760\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shake Shack SSS trends\" width=\"640\" height=\"240\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"240\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879538512747_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shake Shack SSS trends <span>(Shake Shack Q3 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a reminder, comp sales represents sales growth in existing store locations, excluding newly opened or newly closed stores. It decomposes into price growth (from price increases as well as customers' menu mix choices) and traffic (the number of transactions that Shake Shack sells). We note that Shake Shack's core rival in the fast-casual space, Chipotle, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835599-chipotle-challenges-are-ahead-but-the-beatdown-prices-a-lot-in\">also just reported earnings with a much more deflating result of 0.3% comp sales</a> (with traffic still negative, and pricing providing all the uplift).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, the company also continues to pull in more revenue from its franchise partners: licensing revenue grew 21% y/y to $14.6 million, or 4% of total sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also applaud Shake Shack for its efficient cost management. The company notes that its standardized labor model has allowed the company to reduce labor costs to 24.9% of revenue, down 310bps y/y.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1930\" data-height=\"652\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shake Shack labor costs\" width=\"640\" height=\"216\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"216\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879719443238_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shake Shack labor costs <span>(Shake Shack Q3 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, we have to draw out the comparison to Chipotle here, which saw labor <strong>increase </strong>30 bps y/y to 25.2% of revenue. Shake Shack is getting ahead of rising labor costs by taking every opportunity to slice waste out of its labor model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This efficiency mindset carries over into the company's management of commodities as well. While higher beef costs did contribute to a 110 bps rise in food and paper costs as a percentage of revenue, we are heartened by the fact that Shake Shack's Q4 outlook implies blended food and paper cost inflation to moderate down to low single-digit inflation, from mid single digit inflation in Q3. The company says that it has achieved deflation in many items in its food costs that have helped to take away the sting from mid-teens beef price inflation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1810\" data-height=\"610\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shake Shack inflation forecast\" width=\"640\" height=\"216\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"216\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879821689558_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shake Shack inflation forecast <span>(Shake Shack Q3 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shake Shack's restaurant-level profit margins, which is a measure of profitability excluding corporate overhead, rose 26% yen to/y to $81 million, with restaurant margins improving 180 bps y/y to 22.8%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1892\" data-height=\"636\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Shake Shack restaurant margins\" width=\"640\" height=\"215\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"215\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/33427965-17618879945081134_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Shake Shack restaurant margins <span>(Shake Shack Q3 shareholder letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shake Shack's adjusted EBITDA of $54 million also grew 18% y/y, consistent with the company's 3-year financial targets of growing adjusted EBITDA at a ~teens pace.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Key takeaways</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I've been on the sidelines and skeptical about Shake Shack since the start of 2025.

But first, take a look at the MoneyShow Chart of the Day, which shows the one-week change in 2-year yields. You can see the 2-year was yielding 3.5% late last week.

Because Powell said it was “<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-29/powell-says-rate-cut-in-december-is-far-from-foregone-conclusion\" rel=\"noopener noopener\">far from</a>” certain the Fed would follow this week’s cut with another one at the policy meeting that concludes Dec. 10.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since the 2-year yield incorporates expectations about future Fed moves - and expectations for a December cut were high - the surprise remarks caused yields to spike. That, in turn, fueled fresh volatility in several corners of the capital markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, what should you do? Don’t panic. But <em>do</em> keep an eye on the bond market to see if we get more follow-through at the short end of the curve.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If yields keep rising, it will likely give the dollar a boost... restrain any rebound in precious metals prices... <em>and</em> put pressure on high-growth, high-valuation stocks (Big Tech, I’m looking at you!)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The last of those three consequences could be especially important. After all, a ton of money is invested in the tech sector. Plus, we’ve already had questions swirling in the markets about the sustainability of AI spending - and some AI stocks swooning in response. The last thing the group needs is another hurdle to jump over.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Originally published on <a href=\"https://www.moneyshow.com/articles/tradingidea-64544/chart-of-the-day-10-29-25-yes-this-bull-is-still-young/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MoneyShow.com</a></em></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",

Stock and bond markets are falling.</p></li> <li><p>The Fed cut rates as expected by 25bp and also announced the<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> end of its balance sheet reduction also as expected. There was a surprise dissent to the cut by Jeffrey Schmid of the Kansas City Fed with an expected dissent favoring a 50bp cut by Stephen Miran. The statement was largely unchanged with no indication of future rate cuts. The bond market traded off slightly as the dissent was a negative, and the stock market was largely unchanged. We continue to expect a December rate cut and three more cuts in 2026 to get the Fed funds rate to the neutral rate of 2.75%. We project that core PCE will decline to the 2% area by the end of 2026 as the shelter component of CPI has finally started to reflect the decline in market rents. In fact, our real-time measure of inflation utilizing market rents has already declined to the 2% area for core PCE.</span></p></li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>Friday’s inflation print was very bullish, as the critical owner’s equivalent rent component declined to only .1% vs. .4% in the prior month and 3.8% Y/Y. This decline is critical as it finally reflects market rent declines and implies that core PCE will decline to the Fed’s arbitrary 2% target by the end of 2026 as measured shelter inflation finally reflects the decline in market rents.</p></li> <li class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p>The monetary base is the critical leading indicator of inflation and GDP growth. M1 and M2 have become outdated indicators after the GFC, as banks now have massive excess reserves, so the Fed can no longer control the size of bank balance sheets to restrict credit.

Utilities (up 1.12%) underperformed the broader index and posted a lower return than its value peer. Consumer staples (down 2.37%) modestly detracted from performance but outperformed its value counterpart, unlike energy (down 4.19%) that recorded the weakest return relative to its value peers.

The company’s stock performed well during the quarter as gaming operations in Macau showed steady improvement each month. This marks the first sustained recovery in the Macau property in quite some time – a positive sign, as the region accounts for more than half of the company’s earnings. Moving forward, we expect continued improvement in Macau along with contributions from a new project in the United Arab Emirates to drive growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alnylam (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ALNY\" title=\"Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\">ALNY</a>) is a leading company focused on developing gene-silencing technologies to address significant unmet medical needs. The launch of vutrisiran for transthyretin (TTR) amyloidosis exceeded expectations, with second-quarter sales coming in well above consensus expectations. The company also substantially raised its TTR sales guidance, which drove the stock higher.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Insmed (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/INSM\" title=\"Insmed Incorporated\">INSM</a>) develops therapeutic products for patients with lung diseases. In the second quarter, the company received approval for its Brinsupri product to treat non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, making it the first therapy available for a condition that affects up to 500,000 people. This milestone, combined with the positive readout of a trial for another company’s treatment for pulmonary fibrosis, drove the stock’s performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MongoDB (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MDB\" title=\"MongoDB, Inc.\">MDB</a>), a provider of database software, delivered strong earnings results with a positive outlook, driven by large U.S.-based enterprises choosing to build and expand applications on MongoDB’s modern, document-oriented database.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><strong>Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of any fund carefully before investing.

The company reported earnings below expectations due to internal execution issues and increasing competition. Management has since outlined clear strategies to address execution issues, but shareholders remain concerned. We continue to support the stock due to Trade Desk’s strong position in ad spending as the only independent player of scale that we believe can compete with large internet companies, along with its strong margins and cash flow, plus its attractive valuation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Axon Enterprise provides law enforcement and security technology solutions. After an impressive run of outperformance over the past few years, the company’s stock lagged despite posting another quarter of robust growth and positive momentum in its new product development. Axon remains intensely focused on the development of innovative solutions to address all aspects of the law enforcement process and has made significant strides recently in the emerging areas of drones and potentially transformational AI-enabled solutions. In addition, Axon continues to expand its offerings outside of its traditional law enforcement area and has recently highlighted the significant opportunity that could lie in these new markets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wingstop (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WING\" title=\"Wingstop Inc.\">WING</a>) is a franchisor and restaurant operator that specializes in cooked-to-order chicken wings in a fast-casual setting. The stock declined as its core lower-income consumer base remained under pressure. Against this backdrop, investors now expect a weaker upcoming quarterly report and a longer path before the company returns to positive comparable store sales.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fair Isaac (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FICO\" title=\"Fair Isaac Corporation\">FICO</a>) is a leading analytics and software company best known for its FICO credit score, widely used in consumer lending decisions. The stock sold off after the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that lenders would be allowed to use competing credit-scoring products to determine a customer’s credit-worthiness. Despite the challenge to FICO’s longstanding dominance in mortgage credit scoring, management just made Fair Isaac’s largest single-quarter stock buyback in history and raised guidance. We remain optimistic about the value of the company’s data and its ability to monetize it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Dexcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DXCM\" title=\"DexCom, Inc.\">DXCM</a>) is a medical device company that helped pioneer the design and development of continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMs). The company has been under pressure since posting unexpectedly bad results in the second quarter of 2024, despite improving or at least stabilizing revenues and operating profits since then. Recently, there have been concerns over accuracy issues with Dexcom’s latest generation G7 continuous glucose monitor. The company is addressing the issue, but so far it’s unclear whether these issues have impaired the brand and caused a loss of market share.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outlook</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">During the third quarter, the equity markets continued their historic rally from April’s lows. Three key factors drove the stock market’s rapid ascent:</p> <ol class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>An acceleration in the AI investment cycle,</li> <li>limited evidence of inflationary impacts from tariffs, and</li> <li>the prospects for further interest rate cuts from the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed).</li> </ol> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite softer labor market conditions, the economic outlook appears constructive, bolstered by potential incoming tailwinds from both fiscal and monetary stimulus. We note that although investor sentiment has rebounded sharply from record low levels at the market bottom in April, it currently does not show signs of extreme optimism. However, the sharp outperformance of lower-quality and unprofitable stocks during the third quarter suggests that investors have become emboldened to chase riskier stocks into stratospheric valuations. These frothier areas of the market are clearly vulnerable to downside volatility. In our opinion, a selloff in highly speculative stocks would be a healthy event for the market. Historically, these drawdowns in speculative pockets of the market have led to a “flight to quality” into higher-quality stocks with solid growth prospects, many of which lagged during the market’s sharp rally in the third quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We believe the AI investment theme will remain intact into the end of the year as user adoption continues to accelerate and corporate implementations begin to bear fruit. On a cautious note, we recognize that the current lofty multiples of many “AI infrastructure” stocks imply a strong growth trajectory for the next several years and leave little margin for error. Given the longer- term uncertainty around the duration of the AI investment cycle, we are actively scouring our investment universe for “AI adopter” companies that trade at reasonable multiples and are well positioned to see a potential inflection in earnings growth fueled by AI-driven margin expansion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Cyclicals</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We continue to hold a constructive outlook for the cyclical areas of the portfolio. Within energy, we remain positive on natural gas; we expect that the commodity should see multi-year demand growth from both liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facilities and the new power generation required by data centers. On the supply side, we expect the pace of growth for “associated gas” volumes from oil wells in the Permian Basin to slow in response to weakening oil prices. While oil prices have succumbed to an abrupt policy shift by the producers in the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC) to regain lost market share, we believe the removal of this excess supply in the market is potentially an intermediate-term positive. As the market absorbs increased OPEC volumes, North American shale producers, considered the marginal cost supplier, will be challenged to grow supply to meet expected demand in the years ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Within materials and industrials, companies with exposure to the buildout of AI data centers have performed remarkably well in 2025 as hyperscalers have revised capital expenditure (capex) plans significantly higher. While the risk of potential overcapacity looms, demand trends for computing power appear to support these plans for the foreseeable future. As such, we maintain a balanced view given the expectations for strong growth in the years ahead while also noting the risks associated with investors’ exuberance for many stocks across the AI infrastructure landscape.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside of AI, we expect capital spending for manufacturing facilities to see strong tailwinds from both the tax benefits in recently passed legislation and tariff-driven reshoring initiatives. Although residential construction has weakened further in the second half of 2025, we note the recent downward trend in mortgage rates and the potential for legislative support could lay the groundwork for a possible recovery in 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We also continue to see a favorable setup for the aerospace and defense industry. Aftermarket fundamentals remain healthy, particularly in commercial jet engines, as the aging global fleet continues to drive elevated servicing and parts demand. Commercial build rates at two major jet manufacturers appear to be inflecting higher after a prolonged period of softness, providing incremental volume tailwinds across the supply chain. In defense, robust spending growth in new and emerging areas, anchored by the strategic priorities of the U.S. Department of Defense and its partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), offers durable visibility and supports a resilient growth profile for the industry moving forward.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Healthcare</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The healthcare industry remains the largest sector in the United States, with total expenditures reaching $5 trillion and accounting for 17.7% of gross domestic product (GDP). This sector has been growing at an impressive rate of about 5% per year, driven by the aging population and the increasing prevalence of chronic conditions, which are responsible for 75% of healthcare costs. Most individuals over the age of 65 have two or more chronic conditions, and Western medicine often struggles to manage these effectively. Additionally, novel therapies can extend lifespans, allowing people to live well into their 80s, but these therapies are expensive and significantly contribute to rising healthcare costs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite the sector’s size and importance, healthcare has underperformed in recent years, generating lackluster returns compared with major benchmarks. The sector has been working off the excesses brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. The massive deceleration in demand for healthcare products and services after 2021 led to a significant decline in stock prices and, in turn, caused the sector to generate very poor returns on both an absolute and relative basis. The surge in initial public offerings (IPOs), particularly of biotechnology companies during 2020 and 2021, reduced the overall quality of drug candidates being developed, resulting in higher than normal negative clinical readouts and investor abandonment. This has caused volatility not only among biotech stocks, but also among healthcare stocks in general. Healthcare is a highly regulated industry, overseen by agencies such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Regulatory uncertainty, especially with new directors and commissioners being installed, has further deterred investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are, however, reasons for optimism. Recent merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity has picked up, though it remains below normal levels. Much of the M&amp;A activity has been focused on medical device and biotechnology companies, where large acquirers are looking to smaller, innovative companies with new products to enhance their own portfolios and market positions. From a valuation perspective, healthcare is generally more favorably priced than most sectors currently. We believe interest in healthcare stocks could see a resurgence once investors are comfortable with the impact of tariffs, as well as with other policy and regulatory overhangs. Until then, larger active bets are being placed on predictable, U.S.-centric businesses like major distributors, which have steady margins and generate substantial free cash flows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One final point: Biotechnology stocks are getting a boost from the downtick in interest rates. If interest rates continue to decline, we believe that could support a prolonged period of positive returns for the biotechnology industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Information technology</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Volatility began waning in the third quarter as markets digested the evolving news around the tariffs announced in April and as companies explained their exposures. Hardware and semiconductor sectors bounced back while software proved less defensive given fears of threats from artificial intelligence.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investor sentiment has returned with enthusiasm as the underlying macroeconomic data hasn’t deteriorated as many had forecast. Despite lingering uncertainty, inflation expectations have remained stable, and the prospect of further trade deals has provided additional support for risk assets. The Fed’s interest rate cut further helped sentiment late in the quarter. In this environment, technology companies with strong growth prospects, solid balance sheets and consistent cash flow generation continue to stand out as potentially attractive investment opportunities. The current administration is also expected to create a more constructive backdrop for a rebound in mergers and acquisitions, and we are already seeing a revival in IPO activity.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Within the technology sector, we continue to seek durable, well-capitalized companies that are poised to benefit from long-term secular trends such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, mobility and telecommunications infrastructure, digital payments, the Internet of Things, smart homes, industrial automation, security software, e-gaming, and alternative energy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Financials</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The outlook for the financials sector remains constructive as economic growth has stayed resilient and interest rates have begun moving lower. In this environment, we see the most interesting opportunities outside of the typical banking space. Areas we remain excited about include boutique advisory firms poised to benefit from the increase in M&amp;A activity that followed the heightened tariff uncertainty earlier in the year. In addition, we see potential opportunities in the alternative asset space as those products continue to grow and become available in the wealth management and retail channels. Lastly, we see distinct potential opportunities in the transaction processor space.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Consumer sectors</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The continued though slowing moderation in inflation and thus-far steady job market continue to provide support to the consumer. Tariffs so far appear manageable, but the consumer base remains bifurcated with the higher-end consumer faring much better than the low end. Against this backdrop, we find a few dynamics at play: Consumers broadly continue to prioritize travel and experiences over goods, and consumers remain discerning about where to spend discretionary funds. Some areas we remain excited about include:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Companies offering uncommon experiences, such as cruise vacations (and spa treatments while on cruises);</li> <li>Food delivery, which remains an area of growth; and</li> <li>Individual retailers offering distinctive products that we believe can weather the tariff storm.</li> </ul> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tr><td> <p><strong>Risk Considerations:</strong></p> <p>Investments in mid-cap and small-cap companies generally involve greater risks than investing in larger capitalization companies.

When these expectations are not met, investors may punish the stocks excessively, even if earnings showed an absolute increase.

This market is projected to reach USD 584.9 billion by 2032, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of 11.7%.<sup>2</sup> Global electricity demand from data centers is expected to more than double by 2030, with U.S. data centers anticipated to account for nearly half of the growth in electricity demand, contributing over 20% to the overall growth.<sup>3</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To meet the growing energy demands of data centers and other technology-driven applications,<sup>4</sup> U.S. electricity demand is projected to increase by 25% by 2030 and by 78% by 2050, compared to 2023 levels.<sup>5</sup> This growth could have significant implications for the reliability and affordability of electricity, highlighting the urgency of building a robust power system. Research indicates that investments in U.S. power infrastructure are expected to total USD 1 trillion from 2025 through 2029.<sup>6</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The substantial capital flowing into these infrastructure segments has attracted market attention, as their utilization rate will likely be an early sign of the fortunes of AI and its impact on the global economy. S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices aligns with this trend by offering two indices that track these areas: the <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/thematics/sp-data-center-tower-reit-and-communications-equipment-index\" rel=\"noopener noopener noopener\">S&amp;P Data Center, Tower REIT and Communications Equipment Index</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/thematics/sp-us-power-infrastructure-select-index\" rel=\"nofollow\">S&amp;P U.S. Power Infrastructure Select Index</a>.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>S&amp;P Data Center, Tower REIT and Communications Equipment Index</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The S&amp;P Data Center, Tower REIT and Communications Equipment Index measures the performance of developed market-domiciled, U.S.-listed organizations involved in the ownership and management of data centers, telecommunication towers and related equipment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This index employs FactSet’s Revere Business Industry Classification System (RBICS) Focus data to select relevant companies, which are organized into two tiers: Data Center and Tower REITs, accounting for approximately 53% of the index, and Communication Equipment, comprising about 47% as of Sept. 20, 2025.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The index includes 25 constituents, with a substantial 94% weight attributed to U.S.-domiciled companies (see Exhibit 1).

I believe Arlo Technologies current momentum will continue as Service continues their rapid growth and expands overall margins. Now let's go through what has happened the past time.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What Has Happened?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Arlo Technologies has shown good growth the past few years. Stable growth since 2019. However, from 2018 to 2019, Arlo experienced a huge decline in revenue from the retailer's excessive inventories. They overstated the demand for 2019, and the stock fell more than 70% from 2018 to 2019. The worst possible start for an IPO. There have been some fundamental changes for Arlo Technologies since 2018. They have gone from being a more hardware focused company to now being an SaaS company.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Arlo's growth has not been explosive in the past years. Their 5Y average growth has been <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARLO/growth\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARLO/growth\" target=\"_blank\">7.35%</a>, and the growth last TTM is flat/slightly negative. Despite low overall growth, Arlo has seen strong improvements in margins in the past years. This is driven by stronger ARR growth from their subscription services. <a href=\"https://cdn.prod.nntech.io/fundamentals-file-proxy/quartr/pdf/08b8b5ea752c6afa4a30414197230b45.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://cdn.prod.nntech.io/fundamentals-file-proxy/quartr/pdf/08b8b5ea752c6afa4a30414197230b45.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">ARR is up 34% YoY,</a> with more than 5.1 million cumulative paid accounts, up 28.5% YoY. Service revenue represents 60% of total revenue, and was up 30% YoY to $78 million in revenue. Service revenue represented 47% of revenue in Q2 2024, and 44% in Q2 2023. Service revenue has a gross margin of 85%, significantly higher than their hardware segment. Service gross margin was up 850 bps YoY. The increase came from successful cost reductions.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1098\" data-height=\"551\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Key highlights\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"321\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615980635030427_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Key highlights <span>(Arlo Q2)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As Arlo's service revenue continues to outpace Product sales, gross margin is increasing rapidly. The 5Y average is 28.48% gross margin, and in Q2 it stood at 45.8%. This is still far off Service segment's gross margin of 85%, so as far as the Service segment continues to grow and outpaces Product sales, overall gross margin has a high chance to continue expanding.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Product revenue stood at $51 million in Q2, down YoY due to a decrease in ASPs.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/56844909-17616566462232356_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"839\" data-height=\"231\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/56844909-17616566462232356_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Profitability\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"176\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/56844909-17616566462232356_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/56844909-17616566462232356_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/56844909-17616566462232356_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/56844909-17616566462232356_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/56844909-17616566462232356_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/56844909-17616566462232356_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/56844909-17616566462232356_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/28/56844909-17616566462232356_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Profitability <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What is driving this strong momentum is Arlo's launch of their new AI platform, Arlo Secure 6. The CEO also mentioned more product launches are on the way, and a strategic partnership.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The company will be executing the largest product release in company history with more than 100 new SKUs launching throughout our channels this fall. This subscription momentum coupled with our Holiday product launches and announcement of ADT as a strategic partner positions Arlo for continuing success, and will give material upside to our subscriptions and services revenue starting in 2026.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at product sales, they will launch almost 100 new SKUs through this fall. These products have been specially produced and designed to reduce COGS up to 20-30%. This will give them flexibility towards tariff pressures, which they believe could impact product margin by 300-400 bps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Notably, other improvements were FCF yield extending to 14%. That is a major improvement from last year's FCF yield of 10.2%. The improvements came from inventory turnover improving from 5.8x to 7.7x YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Arlo is releasing Q3 numbers on the 6th of November. I would pay attention to ARPU, service revenue momentum, margins, and any updates on the new SKUs. Analysts have an average Q3 revenue to<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARLO/earnings/estimates\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARLO/earnings/estimates\" target=\"_blank\"> hit $138.69 million,</a> which is in line with what analysts are expecting. High estimates are $139 million, whereas Arlo expects the high estimate to be closer to $143 million.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Arlo has announced new product releases, which they are very excited about. New products amplify new subscriptions from new units. Over 100 SKUs to launch during the fall, which will fuel new subscriptions. Looking closer, it is clear that paid accounts are increasing slower than ARR, which means prices are increasing also. This was documented as Arlo increased prices <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24335628/arlo-secure-plus-subscription-price-increase-ai-features-cloud-video-storage?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/4/24335628/arlo-secure-plus-subscription-price-increase-ai-features-cloud-video-storage?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" target=\"_blank\">throughout the year.</a> Paid accounts were up 29% <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"versus\" htloopnumber=\"877421393\">versus</em> ARR, which was up 34% YoY. The new subs came through from new unit sales, not conversion. This is a good sign, as unit sales drive subscription.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ARPU reached the highest recorded level this quarter, and is expected to continue to grow, but at a slower pace than last quarter. ARPU went to $15 in Q2 from $13.48 in Q1, driven by the full rollout of Arlo Secure 6 plans.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1719\" data-height=\"942\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Paid accounts and ARR\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"351\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/27/56844909-17615981134581792_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Paid accounts and ARR <span>(Arlo Q2)</span></p></figcaption></figure> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my valuation, I use a <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"three\" htloopnumber=\"877421393\">three</em>-scenario discounted EPS valuation.

Due to the higher growth rate, it uses a multiple of 35x, closer to today's TTM PE ratio of 36x.

There are talks about the impact of tariffs on Arlo's gross margin in the next quarters. The potential impact of tariffs is being absorbed by cost savings. Therefore, margins will remain good despite tariff concerns. A major concern of mine is lower margin momentum. Margins are increasing at a fast pace, and a slowdown or decline could cause an overreaction. Tariffs could be one of the reasons margins slow down or, worse, decrease.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Subscriptions cancellations are another risk for Arlo. Cancellations can come from competition or, worse, lower disposable income. However, according to Arlo, security subscriptions rank highest for being least likely to be cancelled. Therefore, this eliminates this type of risk.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1391\" data-height=\"695\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Security ranks highest\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"320\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/56844909-1761822261990024_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Security ranks highest <span>(Arlo technologies Q2)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another risk is competition.

They continue to improve margins due to Service segments rapid growth. With new SKUs launching, I believe they will continue to grow their subscription base and increase ARR. As long as Service segment outgrows Hardware sales, there will be strong margin improvements going forward. Tariffs impact on gross margin is a risk, but new cost reductions could absorb many of the tariff cost issues.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe Arlo is a good opportunity based on a strong growth outlook, limited risks, and still good upside potential. Therefore, I rate Arlo Technologies a <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"877421393\">BUY</em>!</p>",

Security selection in Communication Services, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary detracted the most from performance, while selection in Consumer Staples added modest value. Although sector allocation effects are residual to Jennison's bottom-up process, they weighed on returns this period. The underweight to Information Technology was the largest detractor, while the overweight to Communication Services and the absence of exposure to Real Estate contributed positively.</li> <li>Ongoing enthusiasm for AI continued to propel both the Technology sector and the broader market during the quarter, with mega-cap tech leaders Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>), Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>), Meta, and Microsoft significantly increasing capital expenditures in an effort to secure leadership in the space. This unprecedented wave of investment has supported strong demand for specialized NVIDIA and Broadcom chips that power data centers, as well as for critical design and manufacturing companies such as Cadence Design Systems (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CDNS\" title=\"Cadence Design Systems, Inc.\">CDNS</a>) and Taiwan Semiconductor (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSM\" title=\"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited\">TSM</a>).</li> <li>Throughout the year, Jennison added new holdings positioned to benefit from continued AI infrastructure spending, including Constellation Energy (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CEG\" title=\"Constellation Energy Corporation\">CEG</a>), which is benefiting from higher electricity demand from data center growth and Amphenol (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/APH\" title=\"Amphenol Corporation\">APH</a>), a global leader in high-speed connectors essential for advanced semiconductor and AI infrastructure.</li> <li>In contrast, Health Care remained challenging due to policy concerns around drug pricing and reimbursement rates, with the sector lagging the broader market despite some easing of regulatory overhang late in the quarter. Company-specific issues also weighed on results, including disappointing trial data from Vertex Pharmaceuticals (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VRTX\" title=\"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\">VRTX</a>) and a reduced sales outlook from Novo Nordisk (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVO\" title=\"Novo Nordisk A/S\">NVO</a>), prompting the team to exit the latter position.</li> <li>The top contributors to investment results included:<ul> <li> <strong>NVIDIA </strong>benefited from demand for advanced data center and AI computing platforms, unprecedented interest in its Hopper and Blackwell chip architectures, as well as successful execution of major strategic alliances.</li> <li> <strong>Apple's </strong>stock price benefited after the company launched a new, higher priced iPhone lineup that is generating strong early demand.</li> <li> <strong>Tesla (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TSLA\" title=\"Tesla, Inc.\">TSLA</a>)'s </strong>share price increased due to elevated demand in the U.S. from consumers seeking to complete purchases ahead of the tax credit expiry and strong demand for a new Model Y in China.</li> <li> <strong>Broadcom's </strong>stock price benefited from record AI chip orders and rising demand for accelerators from new customers.</li> <li> <strong>AppLovin </strong>has experienced strong advertising revenue growth driven by its AI-powered platform,</li> </ul> </li> <li>The top detractors to investments results included:<ul> <li> <strong>Netflix </strong>experienced a modest pullback during the period, reflecting normal fluctuations following an extended period of outperformance.</li> <li> <strong>Trade Desk (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TTD\" title=\"The Trade Desk, Inc.\">TTD</a>)'s </strong>share price was pressured by advertiser pullbacks related to tariffs, slowing growth, intensifying competition, and a sudden CFO transition. In light of these challenges, Jennison has since removed the position from the Fund.</li> <li> <strong>Novo Nordisk </strong>shares declined after the company lowered its sales and profit outlook, citing intensifying competition in the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) segment and slower growth for key products. Given these headwinds, the team has since sold the position.</li> <li> <strong>Vertex Pharmaceuticals </strong>lost value following disappointing clinical trial results in one of their pain therapy programs.</li> <li> <strong>Intuitive Surgical (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ISRG\" title=\"Intuitive Surgical, Inc.\">ISRG</a>) </strong>was negatively impacted by margin pressures from higher costs and product mix shifts, alongside concerns about escalating U.S. tariffs and slower international growth.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Top Five Contributors</h4> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <thead><tr> <th>Security</th> <th>Sector</th> <th>Average Weight</th> <th>Price Change</th> <th>Contribution to Return</th> </tr></thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>NVIDIA</td> <td>Info Tech</td> <td>10.55</td> <td>18.10</td> <td>1.79</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Apple</td> <td>Info Tech</td> <td>4.98</td> <td>24.11</td> <td>1.11</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tesla</td> <td>Cons Disc</td> <td>2.57</td> <td>40.00</td> <td>1.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Broadcom</td> <td>Info Tech</td> <td>5.27</td> <td>19.68</td> <td>0.99</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AppLovin</td> <td>Info Tech</td> <td>0.99</td> <td>105.25</td> <td>0.84</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table><tbody><tr><td>Source for data: FactSet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FDS\" title=\"FactSet Research Systems Inc.\">FDS</a>) as of 9/30/2025.

Many of the challenges that have emerged over the past nine months, including questions surrounding tariffs, fiscal policy, and geopolitical tensions, remain unresolved, yet the market has continued to advance in the face of them.</li> <li>While potential risks to revenue and earnings growth have not yet materialized, Jennison remains attentive to their possible effects. The market currently appears unconcerned about any significant dampening of consumer spending or broader economic activity. During the quarter, the United States extended a 90-day tariff truce with China, which reduced the immediate risk of broad-based tariff escalation; however, future developments in this area warrant close monitoring.</li> <li>In managing through these uncertainties, the team maintained its disciplined investment approach by focusing on high-quality companies with durable competitive advantages. Jennison is actively assessing the evolving environment for new opportunities while continuing to emphasize long-term growth and prudent risk management.</li> <li>The companies held in the Fund are characterized by their ability to capitalize on multi-year opportunities built around innovation and unique products, supported by sustainable competitive moats and market leadership.</li> <li>Looking ahead to 2026, capital expenditures for many of these companies are expected to continue to surge, with some targeting $100 billion or more in annual investment.

Source: Barron's, Feb. 27, 2025. Barron's rankings are based on asset-weighted returns in funds in five categories: U.S. Equity; World Equity; Mixed Asset; Taxable Bond; and Tax-Exempt (each a \"Barron's ranking category\"). Rankings also take into account an individual fund's performance within its Lipper peer universe. Lipper calculated each fund's net total return for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, minus the effects of 12b-1 fees and sales charges. Each fund in the survey was given a percentile ranking, with 100 the highest and 1 the lowest in its category. That ranking measured how a fund compared with its peer \"universe,\" as tracked by Lipper, not just the funds in the survey. Individual fund scores were then multiplied by the 2024 weighting of their Barron's ranking category as determined by the entire Lipper universe of funds. Those fund scores were then totaled, creating an overall score and ranking for each fund family in the survey in each Barron's ranking category. To qualify for the ranking, firms must offer at least three active mutual funds or actively run ETFs in Lipper's general U.S. Stock category; one in World Equity; and one Mixed Asset. They also need to offer at least two taxable bond funds and one national tax-exempt bond fund. All funds must have a track record of at least one year.</p> <p><strong>Consider a fund's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses carefully before investing.

This structure can effectively minimize volatility in MLP cash flows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In past market downturns, this business model provided protection to midstream operators, helping to prevent a revenue collapse. As a result, that segment of the energy sector delivered robust free cash flow even at low commodity prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Critical pipeline and storage capacity has high average utilization. Regardless of short-term price movements. The demand for transporting energy products is relatively inelastic. Thanks to these defensive characteristics, midstream MLPs have proven comparatively resilient during periods of market stress, often serving as a stable income harbor within the energy sector.<sup>1</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w640\" alt=\"Midstream MLPs\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"369\" height=\"563\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_3c873f792d456c71f92f8ca8a2370cc1.jpeg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Structurally, we believe that several tailwinds will shape the outlook for midstream performance. At the top of that list is a burgeoning demand for natural gas, both at home and around the world.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cleaner energy sources are replacing dirtier ones, and calls for electricity are increasing. U.S. natural gas consumption and exports continue to rise, fueled by volume growth to power-hungry data centers (for artificial intelligence), as well as liquid natural gas (LNG) shipments abroad.<sup>2</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, energy transitions such as switching from coal to gas for electric generation, and increased worldwide energy demand continue to underpin the growth prospects for natural gas infrastructure.<sup>3</sup> North American midstream operators could benefit from new LNG export capacity as well as additional terminals coming online. Volumes moving through pipelines face no shortage of potential tailwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Similarly, the U.S. Energy Information Administration is forecasting all-time highs for U.S. natural gas production, as supply continues to ramp up to meet global demand.<sup>4</sup> Significant private capital investments in energy infrastructure and pro-infrastructure policies are opening additional growth opportunities for pipeline and export facilities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A number of midstream companies have also spent the past few years strengthening their balance sheets by paying down debt and practicing disciplined project spending, which positions them to ride these tailwinds without putting stability at risk.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">One of the more remarkable aspects of the MLP rebound story is just how much cash these assets can generate.<sup>5</sup> Midstream MLPs normally come with a distribution yield similar to asset-intensive industries, such as real estate, utilities or fixed income investments.<sup>6</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Currently, the sector has been producing high single-digit yields - an attractive payout for investors. And remember that these distributions are typically supported by stable fee-based cash flows, adding potentially sustainable income streams over commodity price cycles.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investors interested in capitalizing on the potential MLP revival can consider a fund like the InfraCap MLP ETF (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZA\" title=\"InfraCap MLP ETF\">AMZA</a></span>). AMZA provides a diversified portfolio of 15–35 midstream MLPs with an emphasis on high current income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unlike passive index trackers, this actively managed ETF selectively overweights quality MLP names based on fundamental analysis, and uses modest leverage (typically 20–30%) and option writing to enhance income.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This approach has paid off throughout past volatile conditions: AMZA outpaced the leading Alerian MLP Index through the challenging macro cycle over the five-year period ending September 30, 2025 (2020–2025).<sup>7</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Equally important for investors, AMZA offers the tax advantages of a C-Corp ETF (issuing a single Form 1099 instead of multiple K-1s), while preserving the high yields of the MLP structure.<sup>8</sup></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The result is an accessible, one-ticket solution for those seeking to enjoy the stable cash flows and infrastructure growth prospects of midstream MLPs without the complexity of direct MLP ownership.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMZA performance\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"625\" height=\"281\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7a528286f3b9133ef82923aa75364181.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w640\" alt=\"AMZA fees and expenses\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"624\" height=\"77\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_7123b14ffda2096f8036d631d1e0e08b.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Midstream MLPs appear poised for a resurgence, with relatively stable, fee-based business models and supportive industry trends.
