(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TRIN\" title=\"Trinity Capital Inc.\">TRIN</a></span>) has been on my Top 3 BDC list along with Kayne Anderson BDC, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KBDC\" title=\"Kayne Anderson BDC, Inc.\">KBDC</a>) and Fidus Investment (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FDUS\" title=\"Fidus Investment\">FDUS</a>) for quite some time.</p> <p>For example, in my previous follow-up <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4840054-trinity-capital-one-of-the-best-buy-the-dip-moments-in-bdc-space\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4840054-trinity-capital-one-of-the-best-buy-the-dip-moments-in-bdc-space\" target=\"_blank\">piece</a> on TRIN, I viewed the then-current BDC<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> dip as one of the best buying opportunities in the entire BDC space. Starting from that date, TRIN is up by ~13% (on a total return basis) despite the notable sector-wide selloff that has pushed TRIN's share price lower in the past ~30-day period.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My investment case on TRIN was mostly built around these aspects:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Cheapest internally managed BDC to buy. I'm not including PhenixFIN (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PFX\" title=\"PhenixFIN\">PFX</a>) in the mix for obvious (different business focus) reasons.</li> <li>Very competitive yield</li> <li>Clean earnings profile (e.g., almost no PIK)</li> <li>Robust portfolio quality</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In a nutshell, it boiled down to a juicy and durable dividend case that was supported by a defensive and slowly but surely growing underlying business (or NAV).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And I have to say that it does not feel bad to be right. The recent Q4, 2025 <a href=\"https://ir.trinitycap.com/static-files/bd413a14-cf69-4e77-add9-730dccaf9735\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://ir.trinitycap.com/static-files/bd413a14-cf69-4e77-add9-730dccaf9735\" target=\"_blank\">earnings package</a> clearly proves that TRIN is not your typical high-yielding BDC. And perhaps the best thing here is that we have once again a dip situation in front of us and, at the same time, freshly baked quarterly earnings data points that provide strong evidence of TRIN's dividend (and NAV) durability.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let's dive in.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thesis review</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q4, 2025 figures, we can see that TRIN has managed to deliver an NII of $0.52 per share, which is consistent with the result achieved in the previous quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some might think that it is nothing positive and even disappointing to see stagnating performance. However, as a close and active follower of the BDC space, seeing almost every Q4 BDC earnings report that has been published so far, I can say that this kind of result is exceptional.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, I can't even name a single BDC that has produced stable NII per share results compared to the prior quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason why BDCs have registered weaker NII generation levels is mostly associated with the interest rate cuts <span>by the Fed in Q3 and Q</span>4 <span>2025</span>, where falling SOFR has compressed their NII yield profiles. Then, of course, there are select examples that have suffered non-accruals and been more exposed to spread tightening dynamics.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, as I stated above, TRIN is not your typical BDC. And in this particular instance, it is the combination of the following items that has contributed to stable NII per share levels:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Expanding portfolio base without meaningful non-accrual hiccups.</li> <li>Improved spreads at the cost of debt front.</li> <li>Most importantly, unique NII interest rate sensitivity profile.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The essence of the last bullet is very nicely captured in this chart:</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49926601-17720818311829045.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"NII sensativity\" width=\"608\" height=\"485\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"608\" data-height=\"485\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49926601-17720818311829045.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49926601-17720818311829045.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/49926601-17720818311829045.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>TRIN Q4, 2025 earnings report</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because of favorable interest rate floor mechanics, TRIN is almost perfectly protected from lower interest rates.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I would even say that TRIN has a chance to extract some benefit from lower base rates as it achieved interest rate savings through floating debt (leverage) facilities and pockets higher repayment fees, while the asset yield side remains largely flat. And, of course, in this context, we have to remember that TRIN holds 209 warrant positions across 130 portfolio companies, which move closer and closer in the money as the interest rate environment becomes more supportive for deal making.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, if we speak about credit quality, which has become the key question or concern for the market (mostly driven by SaaS fears), I have two important points to make here.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">First, TRIN has one of the lowest exposures to SaaS in the BDC world. For example, in Q4 its exposure to SaaS was 9.4%, which is down from ~11% in Q3 (that was already a very low level). Meanwhile, the sector blue chips, such as Ares Capital (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ARCC\" title=\"Ares Capital\">ARCC</a>) and Blackstone Secured Lending (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BXSL\" title=\"Blackstone Secured Lending Fund.\">BXSL</a>) have SaaS accounting for ~20% of their loan books (I'm not saying anything bad about these two names, just putting things into perspective).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The comment from management in the Q4 <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874784-trinity-capital-inc-trin-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874784-trinity-capital-inc-trin-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">earnings call</a> provided an encouraging color pertaining to the SaaS issue as well:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The recent overreaction around AI's impact on the software industry is not new to us. We've been dealing with AI-driven disruption for more than 3 years and we've made thoughtful decisions to strategically diversify our portfolio and opportunistically invest in adjacent sectors to the AI space. Enterprise SaaS is currently 9% of our portfolio.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, when it comes to SaaS risk, I think that it would be fair to say again that TRIN is not your typical BDC.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Second, the overall portfolio quality remained in solid shape. The non-accruals came in below 1% of FV. The income that could be tied to PIK stood at an industry-leading level as well (i.e., at ~2%, while the <a href=\"https://www.raymondjames.com/-/media/rj/dotcom/files/corporations-and-institutions/investment-banking/industry-insight/quarterly-bdc-market-update.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.raymondjames.com/-/media/rj/dotcom/files/corporations-and-institutions/investment-banking/industry-insight/quarterly-bdc-market-update.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">sector average</a>, at least based on Q3 data, was 7.9%). These dynamics also go hand in hand with the fact that about 85% of total loan investment principal for TRIN is secured by first liens on the enterprise value equipment, and for enterprise backed loans, the weighted average loan-to-value is just 17%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bottom line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Based on the current P/NAV statistics, where TRIN trades at 1.14x, this BDC still remains as the cheapest internally managed vehicle. And this is despite very robust Q4 earnings figures with a unique earnings and credit quality profile.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given TRIN's $1.2 billion investment pipeline going into Q1 2026, access to accretive equity finance via NAV issuances, and expanding fee-generating asset management platforms (which are also a source of cheap capital), I would certainly expect durable NII per share results. The interest rate risk isolated earnings profile comes in handy as well.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my humble opinion, the Q4 report once again proves that TRIN is not your typical BDC. The interest rate protection mechanism is unique; the credit and earnings quality falls certainly within the top decile, and the fact that it is an internally managed BDC is also a significant (and rare) advantage that provides a strong valuation support (which is good for accretive equity issuances to support sustainable portfolio growth).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">TRIN remains on my Top 3 BDC list.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

This represents an upgrade by the global index provider from frontier to emerging market status.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Strong growth combined with a recognition of its recent capital market reforms in the form of index inclusion means that Vietnam's stock market has gained increased attention from global investors. But, with the vast majority of Vietnamese stocks listed locally and some completely restricted from foreign investment at the individual stock level, Vietnam's stock market can be difficult to access. Even if one can access the market, stock selection can be a challenge for new investors because, as an emerging market, Vietnam's stock market lacks the breadth and depth of sectors seen in more developed stock markets, such as China's.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What are some of the benefits of Vietnam ETFs?</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vietnam ETFs can provide diversified exposure to Vietnam's stock market in a single investment that trades on a US exchange.* However, the <a href=\"https://kraneshares.com/etf/kpho\" rel=\"nofollow\">KraneShares Dragon Capital Vietnam Growth Index ETF</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KPHO\" title=\"KraneShares Dragon Capital Vietnam Growth Idx ETF\">KPHO</a>), through ownership of Dragon Capital's locally-listed product, the Diamond ETF, KPHO provides access to the stocks that reached or are nearing their Foreign Ownership Limits. KPHO also employs an index-based fundamental screen based on specified ranges of price-to-earnings (P/E) and asset-to-equity ratios, as well as a proprietary growth ratio calculated by the index provider, to select eligible securities.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What is the outlook for Vietnam's stock market?</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As investors are looking for opportunities outside the United States and especially within emerging markets, amid a declining US dollar, Vietnam looks compelling. As of February 11, 2026, the average P/E ratio among KPHO's underlying holdings was only 9.7 compared to 17.2 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. At the same time, Dragon Capital, the fund's sub-advisor, expects net profit growth of 16% to 18% in 2026, which is in line with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.<sup>2</sup></p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What are KPHO's top 10 holdings and how do they contribute to Vietnam's growth story?</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">KPHO's current top 10 holdings span financial services, manufacturing, retail, technology, logistics, and real estate. These are all key components of Vietnam's current growth story, which is primarily driven by manufacturing for export, rising incomes and spending, and lending to support these development areas.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_image-3_1.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Vietnam ETF: 10 Stocks Investors Should Get To Know\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_image-3_1.png?io=w750 750w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_image-3_1.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_image-3_1.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_image-3_1.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_image-3_1.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"> </p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Below, we provide a brief description of each of KPHO's top ten holdings, accompanied by financial and operational highlights from 2025.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">KPHO Top 10 Holding Profile &amp; 2025 Earnings Update</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Data from Dragon Capital, KraneShares, company releases &amp; filings as of 12/31/2025. % changes are year-over-year (YoY) unless otherwise indicated.</em> <em>Figures may be adjusted (non-GAAP).</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Hoa Phat Group</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hoa Phat is an industrial manufacturing group in Vietnam that started out as a construction machine and equipment trading company and gradually expanded its operations to include the production of steel, steel pipes, and agricultural products. It also supplies materials for infrastructure projects such as airports and high-speed rail, which are important for Vietnam's current stage of development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Hoa Phat Group By The Numbers (2025):</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +12.4% to $6.0 billion</li> <li>Net Income +28.5% to $0.6 billion</li> <li>Net Margin 9.9%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.04</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Hoa Phat managed a solid earnings recovery in 2025, supported by higher steel volumes on improved domestic demand compared to 2024. Although fourth quarter net profit rose 38%, results were temporarily weighed down by approximately $34.2 million in depreciation and interest expenses following the early capitalization of a second blast furnace at a key steel plant. Steel continued to dominate revenues, accounting for 94% of fourth quarter sales. Despite short-term cost pressures, operating leverage improved as capacity utilization normalised throughout the year.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Vietnam Prosperity (VP) Bank</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VP Bank is one of Vietnam’s largest private-sector banks by assets, operating a diversified platform across retail banking, corporate lending, consumer finance, securities, and insurance. The bank has continued to expand its scale and deepen its ecosystem, supported by a focus on digitalization and fee-based income alongside its core lending activities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>VP Bank by The Numbers (2025):</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +19.9% to $2.9 billion</li> <li>Net Income +52.0% to $0.9 billion</li> <li>Net Interest Margin 5.4%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.12</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">VP Bank (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VUPPF\" title=\"VP Bank AG\">VUPPF</a>) reported improved profitability in 2025. In the fourth quarter, profit before tax rose 43% and net profit rose 43% and net profit rose 72%, reflecting improved operating and bottom-line results. Overall lending growth in the consumer and corporate segments was 35% in the fourth quarter, driven by both the parent bank and improving contributions from subsidiaries FE Credit and VP Bank Securities. Asset quality improved as non-performing loans (NPLs) were reduced to nearly 3%. Meanwhile, cost discipline kept the cost-to-income ratio at near 24%. Strong fee income, bad-debt recoveries, and subsidiary earnings also reinforced the bank’s recovery momentum in 2025.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Sacombank</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sacombank is another key private-sector bank in Vietnam. The bank currently operates 560 branches not only in Vietnam, but also in Laos and Cambodia. Sacombank focuses on retail lending (mortgages, auto loans, etc.) and small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) lending.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Sacombank by The Numbers (2025)</em>:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +11.8% to $1.2 billion</li> <li>Net Income $0.2 billion</li> <li>Net Interest Margin 3.2%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.12</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sacombank recorded a +4% increase in operating income in the fourth quarter. Although the bank's net interest income declined, Sacombank still managed to increase its revenue and net income thanks to a 42% reduction in operating expenses. The bank still recorded a loss of $106 million in the fourth quarter due to a sharp jump in provisioning expenses of $355 million.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Vietcombank</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Originating as a specialized bank serving the country’s external economic activities, Vietcombank has evolved into a full-service, multi-functional financial institution. Today, it operates across a wide range of sectors, offering top-tier services in international trade and traditional banking activities such as capital management, fund mobilization, credit provision, and project financing, as well as modern banking services, including foreign exchange, derivatives, card services, and electronic banking. With a market capitalization of more than $20 billion, Vietcombank now ranks among the world’s 100 largest listed banks. Vietcombank operates an extensive network of more than 600 branches, 3,090 ATMs, 121,035 card payment acceptance units nationwide and 24,000 employees.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Vietcombank By The Numbers (2025):</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +27.4% to $0.4 billion</li> <li>Net Income +4.0% to $0.2 billion</li> <li>Net Interest Margin 2.7%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.09</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">2025 results were mostly in line with the market’s expectations. Vietcombank's credit growth was 15%, compared to Vietnam's overall credit growth, which was reported at 19%. Vietcombank's growth was driven slightly more by retail credit compared to corporate. Consumer credit increased by +18.5% versus only 13% for corporate credit. Net interest margin improved slightly in the fourth quarter, while its ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) remains low compared to the industry average in Vietnam, at just 0.6%.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>HD Bank</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Established in 1990, HD Bank provides a wide array of financial and banking services to individuals, businesses and investors. The bank has a network of 347 banking transaction points and 22,921 financial transaction points, serving over 30 million customers in its ecosystem, including airlines, supermarkets, telecommunications firms. Recently, HD Bank has focused on a strong digital transformation strategy across operations and client-facing activities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>HD Bank by The Numbers (2025):</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +25.4% to $1.6 billion</li> <li>Net Income +29.3% to $0.6 billion</li> <li>Net Interest Margin 4.4%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.13</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">HD Bank's net profit after taxes &amp; minority interests (NPATMI) increased 64% to $200 million in the fourth quarter. Asset quality improved, lowering the number of NPLs as a percentage of total loans outstanding, and the growth of current accounts and savings accounts (CASAs) recovered to 12.4% from the 10% exhibited in the previous quarter. Credit grew by 31% YoY and 13% quarter-over-quarter thanks to strong corporate loan growth of 34% YoY and despite modest retail loan growth of 5% YoY.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>FPT Corporation</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FPT is a pioneer in Vietnam's digital transformation and a leader in IT consulting services, providing and deploying technology and telecommunications services and solutions. With 38 years of history, presence in 30 countries and almost 50,000 employees, FPT is the largest listed technology company in Vietnam.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>FPT Corporation by the numbers (2025):</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +11.6% to $2.7 billion</li> <li>Net Income +19.3% to $0.4 billion</li> <li>Net Margin 16.0%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.20</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Core IT services revenue increased +21% in the fourth quarter on increasing domestic and global demand for IT services. Meanwhile, the telecom segment exhibited slower growth of +9%, but saw better cost management and, as a result, improved profitability.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Gemadept</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Gemadept is a large private port operator in Vietnam, owning ports nationwide across North, South and Central Vietnam. The Gemalink Deep-sea Port is ranked among the 19 ports in the world capable of receiving the largest vessels.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Gemadept by the numbers (2025):</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +23.1% to $0.2 billion</li> <li>Net Income +15.2% to $0.7 billion</li> <li>Net Margin 27.4%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.14</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fourth quarter revenue increased 14.4% to $62 million, adding to total revenue of $230 million in 2025. Revenue from ports rose 12%, accounting for 89% of total sales, as logistics and other business lines revenue increased 35%. Total cargo volume recorded as having been handled by Gemdept's ports increased 17% to 3.1 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). The gross margin for 2025 improved to 46% from 44% in 2024.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Vinhomes</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vinhomes, a large residential property developer in Vietnam by market capitalization, had recorded $37 billion in cumulative contracted sales since 2010 as of October 2025, with presales outstanding of 285,700 residential units, approximately 517,000 residents across its properties nationwide, and 30 urban complexes developed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Vinhomes By The Numbers (2025):</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +50.6% to $5.9B</li> <li>Net Income +29.3% to $1.6B</li> <li>Net Margin 27.3%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.06</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Vinhomes delivered solid sales growth of +218% in the fourth quarter, booking $3.9 billion in net sales thanks to bulk sales at Vinhomes Green Paradise, unit deliveries at Ocean Park 2 &amp; 3, and further sales at Vinhomes Royal Island. Fourth quarter net profit after tax and minority interests (NPATMI) rose +119.8% to $1 billion, while presales remain strong at $1.7 billion with contributions from Ocean Park 2, Golden City, Wonder City and other projects. Unbilled presales in Vinhomes Wonder City, Golden City, Ocean Park 2, Royal Island and Green City totalled $7.2 billion and are expected to be converted into revenues when the units are delivered.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Mobile World Group (MWG)</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MWG is Vietnam’s leading multi-category retail platform by revenue and net income. The company operates thousands of stores nationwide across multiple chains which include thegioididong.com (a retail chain for mobile phones, laptops and accessories), Điện Máy Xanh (a consumer electronics retail chain) and Bách Hoá Xanh (chain of 2,559 modern groceries retail stores), among others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MWG directly benefits from a clear structural shift underway from traditional trade toward modern retail formats, i.e., developed world-style supermarkets as opposed to open-air, multi-vendor markets. Modern trade penetration has increased from approximately 20% of total retail value in 2019 to around 27% in 2024, reflecting steady migration toward organized channels. This transition has been particularly evident in essential categories. In grocery retail, modern trade penetration rose from 9% to 13% over the same period, as consumers prioritized convenience, consistent product quality, and price transparency. At the same time, the growing importance of scale and logistics efficiency has reinforced the competitive advantages of organised retailers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Mobile World by the numbers (2025)</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +16.5% to $6.0B</li> <li>Net Income +89.1% to $0.3B</li> <li>Net Margin 4.5%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.01</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">MWG exceeded profit expectations in the fourth quarter. DMX, which is a subsidiary consumer electronics chain, contributes 43.8% to total revenue, followed by BHX (grocery stores) at 30% and thegioididong (mobile phone stores) at 23.9%. After a period of restructuring, BHX saw 789 new stores opened in 2025, all of which have delivered positive operating profits and nearly 70% of the stores recorded positive EBIT. For 2026, MWG set target of +18% YoY growth in revenue and +30% growth in net profits.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Nam A Commercial Bank</strong></h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nam A Commercial Bank (NAB) officially commenced operations on October 21, 1992, and was one of the first commercial joint-stock banks established after the Banking Ordinance was issued in 1990, which effectively allowed the development of a private banking system. NAB currently offers almost 280 transaction centres and employs more than 5,300 personnel. In 2025, NAB was included in the Southeast Asia 500 list by Fortune Magazine.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Nam A Commercial Bank by the numbers (2025):</em></p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Revenue +27.4% to $0.4B</li> <li>Net Income +15.9% to $0.2B</li> <li>Net Interest Margin 2.7%</li> <li>Earnings per share $0.09</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NAB posted +57% top line growth for 2025 at $152 million, concluding the year with revenue growth of +27% to $444 million. NPATMI for the whole year saw growth of +16%, reaching $161 million in 2025. NAB reported a decrease in NPLs in the fourth quarter, down to 2% from 3% in the previous quarter. The NPL ratio for 2025 is at 2.2%, a slight improvement from 2.3% in 2024. CASA was at the highest level for 2025 in the fourth quarter at 6.1%. However, the CASA remained lower than the 6.6% reported in 2024.</p> <hr class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">*Diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against a loss.

The forward projected EV to EBITDA number of 10.6x and sales of 0.51x (into the middle of calendar 2026) are quite the bargain vs. 2024's equivalent peaks of 40x and 4.5x \"forward\" estimates. All told, if analyst projections hold true, the enterprise valuation stats may point to lower-than-typical underlying ratios on operating results for owners, going back to 2010.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/17314402-17721109349407043.png?io=w640\" alt=\"YCharts - Super Micro Computer, Enterprise Valuation Analysis, Since 2010\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCharts - Super Micro Computer, Enterprise Valuation Analysis, Since 2010, Recession Shaded</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, Seeking Alpha now ranks SMCI with an overall \"A-\" <em>Quant Factor Valuation Grade</em> vs. historical trading ratios and peer AI computer manufacturers currently. The datapoint I like the most is the forward PEG ratio (price to earnings divided by earnings growth rate) of just 0.47x vs. a sector-wide average of 1.4x. Assuming AI buildout rates do not crash and burn in a recession soon, acquiring any asset in the industry with a PEG well under 1.0x (considered strong buy territory historically on Wall Street) should work out well for investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/17314402-17720624894308467_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1140\" data-height=\"1180\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/17314402-17720624894308467_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SMCI/valuation/metrics\" width=\"640\" height=\"662\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"662\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/17314402-17720624894308467_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/17314402-17720624894308467_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/17314402-17720624894308467_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/17314402-17720624894308467_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha Table - Super Micro Computer, Quant Valuation Grades, February 24th, 2026</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Timing The Buy Trade</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, if Super Micro is sitting on a sound valuation with well above average growth prospects, when should an investor acquire a stake? Honestly, today (ASAP) would be a good answer without knowing anything about technical analysis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet, the chart pattern of low volatility and a tight price range in recent months is a positive sign SMCI's quote is turning the corner and preparing to rise again. In fact, a variety of momentum indicators have been moving higher in unison for the first time since October.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Relative strength vs. the S&amp;P 500 index, the <em>Accumulation/Distribution Line</em>, and <em>On Balance Volume</em> are now each above their respective 50-day moving averages (boxed in gold below). Eight times out of ten, this condition exists when price is trending higher, in nearly any equity you research.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A price breakout in coming days to new multi-month highs (above $35) would seem to confirm a new up leg has begun for shareholders.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/17314402-1772109850316475_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"850\" data-height=\"633\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/17314402-1772109850316475_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"StockCharts.com - Super Micro Computer, 18 Months of Daily Price &amp; Volume, Author Reference\" width=\"640\" height=\"477\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/17314402-1772109850316475_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/17314402-1772109850316475_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/17314402-1772109850316475_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/17314402-1772109850316475_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>StockCharts.com - Super Micro Computer, 18 Months of Daily Price &amp; Volume, Author Reference</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Final Thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Super Micro Computer has been one of (if not the) worst performer for investors in the AI hardware space since March 2024's share quote peak. The stock's -68% price change is matched against advances of +100% or better in many peers. My thinking is 2026 may produce the opposite for trends, namely a material gain for SMCI vs. flat to lower pricing in the sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/17314402-1772067157772846.png?io=w640\" alt=\"YCharts - Super Micro Computer vs. AI Hardware/Hyperscaler Peers, Price Change, Since March 2024\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCharts - Super Micro Computer vs. AI Hardware Peers, Price Change, Since March 2024</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Don't say it cannot happen. The valuation for Super Micro has moved from one of the most expensive to the cheapest in the industry, over the last two years. Really, only <strong>Hewlett-Packard</strong> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HPQ\" title=\"HP Inc.\">HPQ</a>) may have a lower valuation regime today in its competitor grouping. However, HP is mainly focused on slower-growth consumer products, holding way too much debt. So, a countertrend SMCI rally in the face of selling elsewhere is entirely possible.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/25/17314402-17720675722761755.png?io=w640\" alt=\"YCharts - Super Micro Computer vs. AI Hardware Peers, Forward 1-Year P/E Est., Since March 2024\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCharts - Super Micro Computer vs. AI Hardware Peers, Forward 1-Year P/E Est., Since March 2024</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For contrarians, pure value investors, and growth-focused capital allocators (PEG and GARP players), Super Micro makes an excellent choice today for purchase. Plus, in terms of timing your buy, technical upside momentum has been building in February.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have a $50-60 SMCI price target range into early 2027 (for a 12-month outlook). Nothing spectacular for gains, but such a result (of +50% to +85% for a total return) could be award winning if most AI hardware names are flat to lower over the same span. Effectively, this move would simply be a retest of October's high trade above $59. At $60, SMCI would trade closer to its 10-year and 5-year average P/E multiple around 20x (estimated EPS approaching $3 in 12 months), and a forward PEG calculation above 1.0x.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What are the investment risks? Downside (or limited upside) may result if the Big Tech boom turns to bust this year, particularly regarding stock market popularity with investors and share pricing. Plus, a recession could force hyperscalers and cloud providers to actually cut spending and cancel contracts for new data center hardware. Under either scenario, I suspect Super Micro Computer would trade closer to tangible book value, where 1.5x for a multiple has been considered incredibly cheap over the decades. </p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/17314402-17721120544927385.png?io=w640\" alt=\"YCharts - Super Micro Computer, Price to Tangible Book Value, Since 2010, Recession Shaded\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>YCharts - Super Micro Computer, Price to Tangible BV, Since 2010, Recession Shaded</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With tangible book value of $11.67 per share, potentially rising to $14 over the next 12-18 months, my modeling of a blowup bottom would be around $20 into 2027, using a long-term 1.5x tangible BV ratio. So, the $18 low quote in November 2024 should hold in a major bearish drawdown this year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given upside potential to $60 vs. downside to $20, I feel the rewards are starting to smartly outweigh the risks in the low-$30s for a purchase price. I rate Super Micro Computer a <em>Buy</em> and have been building a position over the past week.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Thanks for reading.

As a perma NVDA bull, I’m not surprised it delivered outstanding numbers across the board. Some of the highlights included <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/earnings/eps-surprise-summary?period=quarterly\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">quarterly EPS</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> (diluted) coming in at $1.62 a share, beating Wall Street estimates by 5.32%, while revenue hit roughly $68.13 billion, topping estimates by 2.86%.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the year, diluted EPS landed at $4.77, which was about 1.58% above consensus, and annual revenue was approximately $215.94 billion. This was a clean, comprehensive beat by any measure, and yet, the stock dropped about 5% since the report, trading around $185 per share at the time of this publication.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That alone might seem like a paradox on the surface, but I’ll walk through exactly why that happened, and, more importantly, why I think this post-earnings dip is actually a mispricing- a gift to buyers today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that said, my Strong Buy rating for Nvidia remains in place. Now, let’s get into the minute details of what the company actually delivered this quarter.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What was in Nvidia’s fourth-quarter and fiscal 2026 earnings?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company’s <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2026\" rel=\"nofollow\">fourth-quarter revenue</a> reached $68.1 billion, which was up 20% quarter-over-quarter and 73% year-over–year. In perspective, that $68.1 billion in a single quarter is more than what Nvidia made in total annual revenue just two years ago. I think this level of transformation is rare, even in the high-growth tech world, and I also think it still hasn’t fully sunk in for many investors.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the entire year, fiscal 2026 revenue rose 65% to $215.94 billion, while operating income hit $130.4 billion. This is the profit the company makes from its core operations before things like taxes and interest are accounted for. Looking at the bottom line, Nvidia’s annual net income increased 65% to $120.1 billion. Quite an impressive growth for Nvidia’s scale.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That said, the profits side of the release is what impressed me more. The fourth-quarter gross margin recovered to 75%. This was how much profit Nvidia kept after covering the direct costs. And this recovery was critical as investors who were worried about a margin decline wondered whether Nvidia could actually regain a higher level of profitability. Some actually shorted out of panic as Nvidia ramps up production of the new Blackwell-based systems, given the prior setback in gross margin.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’ve written about it before that a margin decline wasn’t overly concerning, especially since that gross margin dip was largely driven by geopolitical uncertainties between Washington and Beijing, not by any fundamental erosion or something similar. And now that it’s recovered to 75%, Nvidia’s pricing power is still very much intact.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The result? Nvidia’s net income for the quarter rose 94% year-over-year to $43 billion, which is more than most S&amp;P 500 companies make in sales over an entire calendar year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And then there’s free cash flow (FCF). Nvidia’s FCF for the quarter reached around $35 billion, while $97 billion for the entire year. These are the funds made available for initiatives like reinvestment, dividends, stock buyback programs, or anything else that would help grow Nvidia’s stock. As an example, Nvidia returned $41 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends for the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I see $97 billion in annual FCF as being a critical metric for long-term investors, as it means Nvidia is actually generating a significant amount of spendable capital, and that financial flexibility is a competitive moat in its own right, especially for the long haul.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s the financial picture, but where does all this revenue come from? For that, we need to see where the real business lives.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia’s Data Center segment is what matters</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Let’s face it. Nvidia’s Data Center segment is the only one investors have their eye on. If you recently started a position, you’re investing in a data center company. I mean, Nvidia’s Data Center segment revenue alone climbed 75% year-over-year to $62.3 billion in the fourth quarter, and that represents over 91% of the total sales. At this point, the days when Gaming was a notable revenue driver… are all but behind us.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Going back. Within the Data Center segment, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874926-nvidia-corporation-nvda-q4-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">networking revenue</a> alone generated over $11 billion in the fourth quarter- which is up more than 3.5x compared to the same period last year. This growth is driven by NVLink - which is Nvidia’s high-speed chip-to-chip connection technology that allows customers to link a large number of GPUs together into clusters. And I think it’s an important detail that investors often miss. The networking sub-segment enabled Nvidia to sell entire systems, rather than just GPUs, and, increasingly, full rack-scale solutions, which command higher pricing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking at it from another aspect, the customer mix is also changing in a way that I think is encouraging for long-term holders. Although hyperscalers still make up about 50% of the data center revenue, the other 50% comes from enterprises, AI model developers, and, quite recently, sovereign governments- and I find this last one particularly interesting. Sovereign AI revenue was virtually nonexistent 2 years ago, but it more than tripled year-over-year to $30 billion in FY2026. Let that sink in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Arguably, customer concentration was one of the most significant concerns since the Data Center segment’s boom, so this growing customer base helps mitigate it. As Nvidia is no longer solely dependent on the spending cycles of 5 or 6 mega-cap tech companies, the market hasn’t fully priced in the moat it provides.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now that that's out of the way, the forward-looking numbers arguably provide the most important detail in this report.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia’s guidance is also quite remarkable</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia guided first quarter FY2027 revenue to about $78 billion, plus or minus 2%. But industry estimates were <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/25/nvidia-forecast-points-to-accelerating-growth-vera-rubin-hits-market.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">roughly $72.6 billion</a>, so the next-quarter might be another beat for Nvidia. Also, that $78 billion guidance reflects about 77% growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Interestingly, management explicitly stated that the $78 billion figure doesn’t assume any data center revenue from China. Well, given the current export controls environment, I think that makes sense, but it is still pretty prudent and conservative. It also means guidance is modeled solely on Western demand and allied-nation customers. So, if Chinese revenue does eventually come through, that would be pure upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think these figures should help ease the broader debate around whether all that AI spending is sustainable. Whether AI spending proves productive over a 10-year horizon is a fair question, but the simple fact is: money is being spent right now. And Nvidia’s revenue reflects that spending today. I think based on the demand signals alone, the near-term sustainability isn’t really in question.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, if the quarter was this strong and the forward-looking factors offer more growth potential, why did the stock drop after earnings?</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why did Nvidia stock drop 5% after earnings?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The pace of growth and how that pace is evolving. Specifically, sequential revenue is decelerating, or the comparison from one quarter to the next. And for a stock priced the way Nvidia is priced, I think that pace matters as much as the absolute numbers in the report.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, the Data Center segment revenue increased 22% sequentially in the fourth quarter, which was below the 25% sequential growth number reported in the third quarter. Moreover, Q1’27 guidance reflects about 15% sequential growth, which is another step down.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Year-over-year growth, however, is still accelerating at 77% clip, and to me, that is excellent by any measure, but the quarter-over-quarter direction appears to be moving in a direction that fuels potential skepticism, as it usually indicates the growth curve is getting steeper.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I say the sell-off offers long-term investors (like myself who own NVDA through a fund) an opportunity- but only if they can ignore the near-term noise. You see, the underlying business did not deteriorate in any meaningful way. The only change was the sequential acceleration, and that is a very different dynamic from an actual slowdown in demand, and a much less concerning one.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What can propel Nvidia even higher?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is what gets me excited about the company. If there’s one factor that will determine Nvidia’s trajectory over the next 12 to 18 months, it is the Vera Rubin. For the unfamiliar, Vera Rubin is the successor to the current Grace Blackwell platform and a complete rack-scale AI system designed to be deployed as a single package in a data center. CFO Colette Kress mentioned on the earnings call that Nvidia shipped its first Vera Rubin samples and remains on track for production shipments:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We shipped our first Vera Rubin samples to customers earlier this week, and we remain on track to commence production shipments in the second half of the year.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its performance claims are also significant. According to management, the next-generation Rubin GPUs are expected to deliver better performance per watt compared to the Blackwell predecessors, and Nvidia says Rubin targets up to a 10x reduction in inference tokens compared to Blackwell. That’s a big deal, as inference is the process by which the AI responds to a command. And the cost of doing that at scale is one of the most significant expenses for companies running AI apps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming the claims are real (and I don’t see why they wouldn’t be), a 10x inference cost reduction would change the math for Nvidia’s customers. More complex AI use cases suddenly make better economic sense with Rubin, which could spark a new upgrade cycle, even if existing Blackwell systems are running well on their own.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And the backlog on the roadmap proves my point. Kress also stated on the fourth quarter call that Nvidia will surpass the previously announced $500 billion in chip orders for calendar 2025 through 2026. Her exact remarks were:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We look ahead, we expect sequential revenue growth throughout calendar 2026, exceeding what was included in the $500 billion Blackwell and Rubin revenue opportunity we shared last year. We believe we have inventory and supply commitments in place to address future demand, including shipments extending into calendar 2027.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The demand pool is also growing, as CapEx estimates from the top five cloud providers are approaching $700 billion- at least according to some industry reports. Now, if Vera Rubin ships on schedule, which is expected in the second half of 2026, and early production overlaps with the still-strong Blackwell demand, NVIDIA could be running two high-demand product cycles at the same time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And with Nvidia, that’s nothing new. In fact, a similar scenario occurred during the Hopper-to-Blackwell transition. I think the potential for a repeat of that pattern is what supports the $78 billion guide in the first quarter of FY’27, and personally, I believe it’s what will ultimately spark the next bull run with the stock.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Glance at Nvidia’s valuation</h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, this might be a bit counterintuitive data point in the entire analysis, but the valuation numbers back it up. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVDA/valuation/metrics\">Nvidia’s forward P/E</a> (GAAP) currently sits at around 27x. That is about 9% below the sector median. Yes, the world’s most valuable publicly traded company is trading at a discount relative to the sector median.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nvidia is also one of the only 2 companies in the Magnificent 7 group that trades below industry peers on this metric, alongside Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), which I also think trades at a good entry point- right now. Here’s what the MAG7 lineup looks like on this lens:</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <colgroup> <col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> <tr> <td><p>Company</p></td> <td><p>FWD P/E Ratio (GAAP)</p></td> <td><p>Sector Median</p></td> <td><p>Premium</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Nvidia Corporation</p></td> <td><p>26.86</p></td> <td><p>29.62</p></td> <td><p>(9.33%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Microsoft Corporation</p></td> <td><p>23.29</p></td> <td><p>29.62</p></td> <td><p>(21.39%)</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Meta Platforms (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/META/\">META</a>)</p></td> <td><p>22.08</p></td> <td><p>16.16</p></td> <td><p>36.66%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Alphabet (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a> / <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>)</p></td> <td><p>27.19</p></td> <td><p>16.16</p></td> <td><p>68.27%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p><a href=\"https://amazon.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon.com</a> (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN/\">AMZN</a>)</p></td> <td><p>27.17</p></td> <td><p>17.70</p></td> <td><p>53.54%</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p>Apple Inc.

The thing is that Nvidia’s earnings have grown so “fast and furious,” leading investors to wonder, is this growth sustainable? I mean, it’s one thing if Nvidia were a startup, but they’re the most valuable company in the world by market cap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As Vera Rubin ramps up, and should the dual-revenue cycle get started in FY’27, expect the estimates for FY’27 and 28 to be revised notably higher. That will more likely trigger a re-rating where the stock once again catches up to the earnings pace.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, I expect a significant run-up in the next 12 to 18-months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Of course, there’s two sides to every pancake, and for Nvidia, the biggest foreseeable risk isn’t about demand- well, I mean it is, but not in the way you might think.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What’s the risk that deserves attention?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Specifically, the biggest risk I’m looking right now is with the memory suppliers, and if they can keep up. Just like every laptop or PC needs certain amount of memory to operate (my MacBook Air has 16GB for example) , every Nvidia AI accelerator requires its own memory: High Bandwidth Memory (HBM). The problem is that it’s only produced in quantity by three companies: Micron (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MU\" title=\"Micron Technology, Inc.\">MU</a>), Samsung (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SSNLF\" title=\"Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.\">SSNLF</a>), and SK hynix (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HXSC.F\" title=\"SK hynix Inc.\">HXSC.F</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, based on what we know from the HBM producers, supply is fully allocated through the end of this year, and continued supply tightness could spill into 2027. This becomes a short-term game of ping-pong. We have demand now, but supply will take time to deliver. But this is already known. In fact Nvidia already expected the HBM supply limitations to weigh on the Gaming segment in Q1’2027. According to Kress:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>The second part was focusing on our Gaming. As much as we would love to have additional more supply, we do believe for a couple of quarters, it is going to be very tight. If things improve by the end of the year, there is an opportunity to think about what that is from a year-over-year growth.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The bright side is that HBM is a higher-yielding product, making it more advantageous to manufacture. But any delays in HBM deliveries could limit how many Very Rubin systems Nvidia can ship in the second half of the year. The result? Billions of potential revenue could materialize in future quarters. That said, if you’re a memory producer, you’ll want to make as much as the market will buy, when they need it, so I don’t see this supply constraint to last.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">What’s my verdict for Nvidia?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Every major AI model, every cloud deployment, every sovereign AI initiative runs on Nvidia’s architecture. It's no longer just a semiconductor vendor but an infrastructure layer for the entire global AI ecosystem, and I think many haven’t internalized this yet. The Vera Rubin platform offers not only a compelling upgrade cycle, but a compelling path to a dual-revenue cycle- either of which could re-rate the stock over the next 12-18 months.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sure, the risks can’t be discounted. Supply chain physics and geopolitical uncertainty will only create volatility… until they don’t. But the structural demand for AI compute is a secular shift, and Nvidia sits right at the center of all of it without a credible competitor for at least in the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And of course, this post-earnings pullback doesn’t change my sentiment. If anything, it makes the entry point more attractive for long-term investors. When we add up the sum of the catalysts and the risks, today's stock price is far lower than it should be. As a result, my Strong Buy rating for Nvidia remains in place.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Alphabet’s business continues to grow at an aggressive rate, the company remains a dominant force in the search market, and its cloud offerings reached new records in Q4 thanks to the rising demand for computing power. While the market is questioning the company’s massive capital spending plans to expand its AI capabilities, I view the recent depreciation of the stock as a buying opportunity since Alphabet has plenty of resources to weather any incoming crisis and thrive in the years to come.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The AI Trade Isn’t Ending Anytime Soon</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Alphabet’s Q4 earnings <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4547421-alphabet-gaap-eps-of-2_82-beats-by-0_18-revenue-of-113_82b-beats-by-2_34b\">report</a> was certainly good, given that its revenues increased by 17.9% Y/Y to $113.82 billion and were above the estimates by over $2 billion. As expected, the search business continues to be one of the main drivers of growth as its <a href=\"https://s206.q4cdn.com/479360582/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/2025q4-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">revenues</a> during the quarter were $63.08 billion, up from $54.03 billion a year ago. With a nearly 90% <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share\" rel=\"nofollow\">share</a> of the global search engine market, Alphabet will likely continue to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the <a href=\"https://mediabrief.com/global-advertising-spend-to-reach-1-3tn-in-2026-up-9-1-warc/\" rel=\"nofollow\">rising</a> ad spending within the global advertising market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">More importantly, as users pivot to AI chatbots and AI-powered search engines, Alphabet has everything going for it to also benefit from this development. During the earnings call, Alphabet’s management <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4866108-alphabet-inc-googl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">said</a> that their AI Overviews product, which has been integrated into Google’s search engine, is performing well, while another product, AI Mode, has experienced a rise in daily queries in the United States. It was also stated that users are now engaging in longer sessions on AI Mode, which indicates that the fears of Alphabet falling behind in the AI race were overblown. In addition to that, the Gemini chatbot itself has recently reached over 750 million MAUs, experienced a rise in engagement, and <a href=\"https://www.similarweb.com/corp/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/attachment-Global-AI-Tracker-6.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">started</a> to gain market share at a time when OpenAI’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>) ChatGPT experienced a decline in traffic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With $126.84 billion in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG/balance-sheet\">cash</a> reserves and only $66.99 billion in total debt, Alphabet is also positioned best to weather any incoming crisis. For comparison, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/29/technology/openai-in-talks-to-raise-as-much-as-100-billion.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenAI generated</a> only $13 billion in revenue in 2025 and remained unprofitable. Given that it plans to spend significant sums of money to expand its computing power even more in the following years, its unprofitability could become a major issue if it overstretches its resources. Alphabet doesn’t face such an issue thanks to the booming search business and a solid balance sheet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What’s also important to mention is that Alphabet’s solid foothold in the cloud business also helps the company to benefit from the growth of its competitors. It was reported that Alphabet is providing computing power to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/openai-taps-google-unprecedented-cloud-deal-despite-ai-rivalry-sources-say-2025-06-10/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenAI</a> and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4553201-anthropic-may-share-up-to-64b-with-amazon-google-microsoft-in-2027\">Anthropic</a>, both of which are its rivals in the chatbot business. Thanks to the impressive demand for the computing power caused by the ongoing generative AI revolution, Alphabet’s cloud business was able to increase its revenues by 48% Y/Y to $17.66 billion in Q4 and will likely continue to grow in the foreseeable future.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering all of this, it’s safe to assume that the AI trade is not ending anytime soon, and Alphabet still has room for growth. Given its performance in Q4, it’s not a surprise that the company <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG/earnings/revisions\">received</a> 50 upward revenue revisions and 0 downward revenue revisions in recent months. With the amount of growth opportunities that Alphabet has going for it, it makes sense to say that the company has the potential to create additional shareholder value in the months to come.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>What’s Next For Alphabet’s Shares?</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Following the great performance in Q4 and the improved outlook for 2026, it’s safe to assume that Alphabet’s shares remain an attractive investment in the current environment. Before the release of the Q4 results, my discounted cash flow model showed that the company’s fair value is $360.65 per share. Considering that we recently got fresh numbers for the latest quarter, it makes sense to update that model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the beginning of this month, I assumed that Alphabet’s revenue growth rate in FY25 and beyond would be 15%. Thanks to the great performance in Q4, the annual revenue growth rate was 15.1%, while the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG/earnings/estimates\">consensus</a> now is that in FY26 the growth rate will be 16.75%. Considering this, I have also increased my revenue assumptions from 15% to 17% for FY26. In all the other years, the growth rate is now in the range of 16% to 17%, as there’s a potential for Alphabet to continue to scale its business given its competitive advantages against others.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The EBIT in FY25 grew less than I expected. As such, the assumptions for the EBIT margin have been slightly decreased. The tax rate in FY26 and beyond is the average rate of the last three years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for the capital expenditures, they are expected to significantly increase in 2026. <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4866108-alphabet-inc-googl-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">Alphabet now expects</a> its CapEx this year to be in the range of $175 billion and $185 billion. This has been reflected in the model as well. At the same time, the company noted during the latest earnings call that the depreciation is going to meaningfully increase later this year due to the increase in CapEx investments. Therefore, my assumptions for the depreciation and amortization in the model have also been meaningfully increased. The assumptions for the change in net working capital in the updated model didn’t change significantly in comparison to the last model.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/40909655-17721327288472624_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1652\" data-height=\"866\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/40909655-17721327288472624_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Alphabet's DCF Model\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"335\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/40909655-17721327288472624_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/40909655-17721327288472624_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/40909655-17721327288472624_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/40909655-17721327288472624_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Alphabet's DCF Model <span>(Historical Data: Seeking Alpha, Assumptions: Author)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Under the updated assumptions, my DCF model shows that Alphabet’s fair value is $388.68 per share, which is slightly above the previous expectations and above the current market price.

However, during any type of crisis, the company’s shares could nevertheless experience a major depreciation in the short to near term as investors trim their positions in times of uncertainty.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Considering the rise in <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-14/ai-bubble-fears-are-creating-new-derivatives-credit-weekly\" rel=\"nofollow\">fears</a> of the potential AI bubble collapse, stocks of major tech companies like Alphabet were not able to appreciate in value in the last month despite reporting solid earnings results. Investors are currently questioning the massive commitments by the firms to increase their capital expenditures in order to expand their AI capabilities. After all, there’s no guarantee that those AI investments will yield significant <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/08/21/ai-wall-street-big-tech\" rel=\"nofollow\">returns</a>. The fact that Alphabet’s CapEx is expected to increase from $91.45 billion in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG/cash-flow-statement\">2025</a> to between $175 billion and $185 billion in 2026 is one of the main reasons why the company’s stock failed to appreciate despite the major growth that the underlying business has shown in Q4. There’s a risk that the stock price fails to grow in the foreseeable future if the spending on AI gets out of control, as it could prompt investors to look for safer investments.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite all of those risks, I believe that Alphabet will be able to thrive in the long run, even if it overspends on AI, and some of the spending will go to waste. This is because the company remains a solid force in the search and cloud markets, and its business is unlikely to be disrupted anytime soon, especially following the antitrust ruling that was discussed in detail in my last article on the company. More importantly, the company’s strong balance sheet should help Alphabet weather any incoming crisis, while the latest upbeat outlook for 2026 gives reasons to be optimistic about the business’s performance in the upcoming quarters. Because of that, Alphabet remains an attractive investment to me, especially at the current price.</p>",

The paradoxical aspect was that this was occurring<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> in the first year of the Trump presidency. The rationale was based upon three main pillars: monetary easing that would decrease the cost of borrowing for capital-intensive renewable energy companies, the growing demand for clean energy driven by AI that would provide a long-term tailwind for clean energy companies, and a relatively attractive valuation discount compared to the broader market as well as the US Energy sector.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_4d288d5f4614872c556193aef4b06502.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_4d288d5f4614872c556193aef4b06502.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_4d288d5f4614872c556193aef4b06502.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/saupload_4d288d5f4614872c556193aef4b06502.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by <a href=\"https://ycharts.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">YCharts</a></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The recommendation was a BUY with a cautionary note regarding emerging regulatory headwinds. The recommendation has been proven to be in the right direction, with the fund rising a further 25%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Fund</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ICLN aims to provide exposure to the renewable energy trend, investing in solar wind and other renewable energy sources. The fund is diversified in terms of geographic exposure with the largest region being the US. It is meant to track the performance of the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Transition Index, which consists of around 100 companies with at least $300 million in market cap, $100 million in float adjusted market cap and $3 million median value traded over a six-month horizon. Since the writing of the initial article, ICLN has continued to build on its momentum in a substantive way. The fund’s assets under management have <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ICLN/liquidity\">reflected</a> this with its growth from $1.56 billion to over $2.23 billion up until mid-February of 2026.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721395060027485.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"624\" height=\"261\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721395060027485.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721395060027485.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721395060027485.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Grading-wise, the fund has maintained or improved its grades as per the Seeking Alpha grading system. Improving in categories such as Risk and Momentum. Regarding the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ICLN/risk\">Risk</a> category, ICLN has top tier Tracking Error, drastically lower than the median ETF. Liquidity is high, with over $70 million traded daily over a 3- month time range. The fund is characterized with an <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ICLN/dividends/scorecard\">B Dividends Grade</a> mainly for its long track record of dividend payments being 17 years and its solid dividend growth rate in the past 3 and 5 years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Policy Headwinds: Clean Energy Loan Rollback, Endangerment Finding Repeal</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although the former recommendation has stood the test of time in terms of performance, the regulatory landscape has evolved significantly since then, and two significant events require attention.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In January 2026, the United States Department of Energy <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4541934-trump-administration-revising-or-scrapping-over-83b-in-clean-energy-loans\">revealed</a> that its Office of Energy Dominance Financing, the renamed successor to the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment under the previous Biden Administration, is restructuring, revising, or eliminating over $83 billion in clean energy loans and conditional loan commitments made by the previous administration. Out of the total principal loan obligations of $104 billion under the previous administration's policies, about $30 billion is being outright de-obligated, while a further $53 billion is currently under revision.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a significant move with substantial implications. Out of the total loan commitments being revised or eliminated, about $9.5 billion specifically for wind and solar projects has been eliminated and redirected to natural gas and nuclear energy. The office has also signified a clear strategic shift with its <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/edf/articles/letter-leadership-edf-2025-year-review-and-looking-forward-2026\" rel=\"nofollow\">new priorities</a> comprising nuclear, coal, oil, gas, critical minerals, geothermal, and grid infrastructure, with solar and wind being suspiciously removed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is a significant reduction in the level of funding support that the government provides to the exact type of projects that many of ICLN’s constituents rely upon for project development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, it should be noted that the diversification of ICLN’s constituents also reduces the overall impact of the policy change. While the United States is the largest position in the fund, it is not the only one.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721397704345965_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"817\" data-height=\"323\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721397704345965_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"253\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721397704345965_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721397704345965_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721397704345965_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-17721397704345965_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>ETFDb</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund also has large allocations to China and Brazil, among others. Therefore, the fund is not necessarily trapped to the policies that the government in the United States dictates. The international constituents, in particular the European utilities, operate in a completely different environment and are actually <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_2586\" rel=\"nofollow\">moving forward</a> with clean energy development.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps more impactful was the February 12, 2026 <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/president-trump-and-administrator-zeldin-deliver-single-largest-deregulatory-action-us\" rel=\"nofollow\">announcement</a> by the Trump administration of the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4552175-trump-reverses-landmark-endangerment-finding-in-major-blow-to-climate-regulations\">repeal</a> of the 2009 Endangerment Finding by the Environmental Protection Agency, which states that greenhouse gases present a threat to the health and welfare of the public and had been the foundation for all U.S. federal climate regulations for almost 20 years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-epa-endangerment-finding-greenhouse-gases-climate-change/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> called</a> the repeal \"the single largest deregulatory act in the history of the United States.\" It repeals the legal foundation for setting greenhouse gas emissions standards on vehicles, power plants, and oil and gas facilities, and also strips the EPA of legal authority, according to the administration, to regulate greenhouse gases at all, under the Clean Air Act.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The practical effects of this change are substantial. Vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards, which was one of the largest motivating factors for the adoption of EVs in the first place, has been de facto eliminated. The power plant and industrial emissions standards that came out of the Endangerment Finding are equally at risk of being legally challenged or administratively changed. From the perspective of clean energy companies, the effect of this change has been the elimination of a regulatory structure that has been pushing utilities and automakers to new sources of renewable energy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Environmental and health groups have already sued the EPA over this change. The process will be long, and it's entirely possible that much of the regulatory structure will be put back in place. However, the uncertainty of this for the near future cannot be dismissed.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Valuation</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">From a valuation standpoint, the fund boasts a 17.52x P/E, rising from 14.75x at the point in time the original article was made. Relative attractiveness to the broader U.S. market is still present, with it trading at around <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/\" rel=\"nofollow\">27.76x</a> P/E. The same is true regarding the comparison to the U.S. Energy sector as a whole, with the fund trading at a discount compared to the <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IYE/\" rel=\"nofollow\">21.73x</a> P/E of the energy sector.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-1772141317680681.png?io=w640\" alt=\"table\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"453\" height=\"214\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-1772141317680681.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/53538703-1772141317680681.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha, Author Compiled</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The top 10 constituents don’t offer the same compelling picture they did in the original article, with them trading at higher P/E ratios both in absolute and relative terms compared to their 5-year average.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Rating Downgrade</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The original BUY rating for ICLN was given with particular diligence regarding the regulatory environment. This risk has since materialized with two of the most important regulations. The $83 billion loan rollback and the repeal of the Endangerment Finding represent a deliberate and strategic attempt to shift the course of domestic energy policy away from renewables and towards fossil fuels and nuclear energy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, the long-term investment thesis of the original rating has not been disconfirmed. The AI-driven energy demand supercycle continues to play out. Goldman Sachs' <a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/is-nuclear-energy-the-answer-to-ai-data-centers-power-consumption\" rel=\"nofollow\">projection</a> of 40% of additional power demand being met by renewables has not been disproven. The monetary environment has continued to soften globally, which has eased pressure on the highly leveraged balance sheets of renewables-focused companies. This is evidenced by the declining interest expenses for companies like <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BE/income-statement\">Bloom Energy</a>(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BE\" title=\"Bloom Energy Corporation\">BE</a>) and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NXT/income-statement\">Nextpower Inc</a>.(<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NXT\" title=\"Nextpower Inc.\">NXT</a>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">ICLN’s international exposure offers some diversification from domestic policy shifts. The valuation of the fund, while no longer as attractively priced as it was during the publication of the original article, remains reasonable by comparison to the overall market and the energy sector specifically.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The risk profile has deteriorated on the policy front and after a rally of more than 50% on a yearly basis, the entry point has become less attractive. The tailwinds of the easing cycle have become more and more priced in and the legal uncertainty even if the courts grant a repeal regarding the Endangerment Finding, in my opinion, will still weigh on sentiment. Consequently, I downgrade my rating to HOLD.</p>",

The main growth driver for the Q4 quarter was GCT's accelerating transition toward a third-party (3P) marketplace model: by the end of Q4 2025, the 3P sellers accounted for ~54.0% of total marketplace GMV, and in absolute amounts, the growth looks stunning.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772172847693635_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1240\" data-height=\"669\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772172847693635_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"GCT's Q4 IR updated presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"345\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772172847693635_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772172847693635_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772172847693635_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772172847693635_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GCT's Q4 IR updated presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Those 3P participants are bringing in higher-margin revenues for GCT, so the very trend of GCT switching from a capital-intensive 1P retailer into a high-margin platform looks healthy, promising a better recurring revenue stream with lower inventory risk for 2026-2028 (at least).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For a single quarter, GCT added 670 customers in its GigaCloud Marketplace (+5.8% QoQ or +29.9% YoY), and when we look at unit economics, we see that the spend-per-customer is on the rise as well. For example, per the IR materials, those customers who joined in FY2024 have increased spending from $86 million (in Q4 FY2024) to ~$99 million in Q4 FY2025, which is a YoY growth of ~15.11%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721730683402498_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1312\" data-height=\"695\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721730683402498_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"GCT's Q4 IR updated presentation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"339\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721730683402498_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721730683402498_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721730683402498_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721730683402498_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>GCT's Q4 IR updated presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The area of my interest in the past was GCT's scaling in Europe - I thought that this new market for the firm would make it possible to offset the weakness caused by the US‑China trade war. Indeed, the U.S. market showed relative softness in Q4, but my assumption from the past played out well, as GigaCloud saw its European revenues surge by 68% YoY in Q4. The company has expanded its infrastructure in Europe to seven facilities, with 6 of these facilities being in Germany. The management wants to explore the UK now after the success in Germany - they're already operating a fulfillment center and a port of destination there, so once they add another node, it's going to accelerate their non-US business expansion and lead to abnormal growth rates ahead.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">GCT is also quite active in M&amp;As, and I think they're doing a good job turning their targets around. For example, they turned Noble House, once a bankrupt entity losing about $40 million per year, into a profitable branch that showed 40% revenue growth in Q4. I expect that their new purchase - New Classic Home Furnishings, which they bought for $18 million cash - will get integrated throughout 2026 and add tremendous value. As the management described it, New Classic Home Furnishings is \"a traditional distributor with deep roots in brick-and-mortar retail and &gt;1,000 retail partners\", so this customer base might drive another round of massive growth for the GigaCloud technology platform this year, thanks to the omnichannel experience GCT is about to go through. At least that's how I view it.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What I like about GCT is that the management doesn't just reinvest the FCF they get into a bunch of new M&amp;A targets or facilities - they're actually returning a lot of value to shareholders through repurchases. They've already executed about $33 million of the $111 million share repurchase program they authorized in August 2025, helping the stock reprice higher. Given that the program is far from being completed, and considering the consensus-beating potential (and the resulting rise in investors' interest in the stock), GCT is likely to keep enjoying the current rally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What supports the above finding of mine is GCT's valuation. Yes, there was some multiple expansion, but on a forward basis, GCT is still trading at less than 10x earnings:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bb4dcff9f7096b3b702d6ae5f5ad8eae.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bb4dcff9f7096b3b702d6ae5f5ad8eae.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bb4dcff9f7096b3b702d6ae5f5ad8eae.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bb4dcff9f7096b3b702d6ae5f5ad8eae.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On most metrics available for comparison to the consumer discretionary sector, we see that GCT looks 15-50% undervalued:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721741549426563_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"973\" data-height=\"753\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721741549426563_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha, GCT\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"495\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721741549426563_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721741549426563_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721741549426563_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-17721741549426563_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha, GCT</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We saw how GCT was able to deliver 30%+ YoY growth in GAAP EPS in Q4 2025, but the only analyst who covers the stock still projects the firm to grow its earnings by just 11.42% and 6.5% YoY in FY2026 and FY2027, respectively:</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772174225921705_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1490\" data-height=\"452\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772174225921705_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Seeking Alpha, GCT's EPS consensus\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"194\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772174225921705_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772174225921705_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772174225921705_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/49513514-1772174225921705_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha, GCT's EPS consensus</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I think GCT is capable of showing more than that.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assuming a 20% YoY EPS growth for FY2026 and a forecast of 10% for FY2027, I think that GCT should trade at 12-14x earnings within the next 12 months (partially thanks to buybacks that artificially push the multiples higher). With that in mind, I have an FY2026 EPS of ~$4.25 and a midrange P/E exit ratio of 13x, and all this leads to a price target of $55.25/share. That's an upside potential of ~17.6% to the post-Q4 stock price.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are some risks that every investor should keep in mind when considering GCT as a potential buy. First, despite the diversification efforts we've seen over the past quarters, GigaCloud's model still heavily relies on connecting manufacturers in Asia with Western markets, so it's very sensitive to any trade war escalations. Second, over the past 6 months, CEO Lei Wu and COO Xinyan Hao <a href=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/gigacloud-technology-nasdaqgct-shares-gap-up-on-better-than-expected-earnings-2026-02-26/\" rel=\"noopener\">have executed numerous share sales</a>, and while these transactions were largely executed under pre-established Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, there's a risk that if they keep doing so, the rise in supply of insider shares can create a technical ceiling for the stock price shortly. Third, assuming that GCT keeps trading at 10x and the current FY2026 EPS consensus estimate is spot on, my price target would drop to just $40/share. The current stock price would become overvalued by almost 15%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Bottom Line</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While I admit that GCT carries major risks for consideration and that the firm's GMV won't be rising by 50-70% annually indefinitely, I think that for the rest of 2026 and likely 2027, the stock still looks quite tempting (even after the post-Q4 surge). I actually liked the Q4 result, and I'm expecting some positive revisions to kick in shortly. As I see an undervaluation of 17-18%, I decided to keep my \"Buy\" rating unchanged for now.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Thank you for reading!</em></p>",

Indeed, HSBC was valued at a bottom P/BV multiple of only 0.4x back in 2020 and less than book value at the end of 2024, showing that its strong share price performance over the last year was largely due to a re-rating of its shares rather than earnings or book value growth.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Indeed, the bank has recently released its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556382-hsbc-holdings-misses-q4-estimates-bank-increases-dividend\">earnings related to 2025</a>, which showed a positive operating performance, but that was not that impressive that justifies a very strong re-rating of its shares, in my opinion.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Its reported revenues amounted to $68.3 billion during last year, up by just 4% YoY, supported by higher net interest income and fee growth. On the other hand, its revenues were impacted by business disposals performed during 2024, namely in Argentina and Canada, plus the dilution of its stake in </span>BOCOM (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BCMXY\" title=\"Bank of Communications Co., Ltd.\">BCMXY</a>) following a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4426737-china-to-inject-69b-into-state-banks-to-strengthen-capital-reserves\">capital increase</a> last June also had a negative effect on HSBC’s revenue. These items impacted HSBC’s revenues by close to $2 billion in 2025, while adjusted for these impacts, its revenues would have been around $71 billion last year, up by 5% YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>While its top-line growth was not fantastic, this can be considered a positive outcome as there were some headwinds from lower USD rates, which were offset by the bank’s loan growth, higher income from the structural hedge portfolio, and higher fees in the Wealth and Wholesale Transactions Banking segments.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Its banking NII was practically flat compared to the previous year at about $44 billion, representing some 64% of the bank’s total revenues, as lower rates impacted income. For 2026, the bank’s guidance is to report NII of at least $45 billion, representing an annual increase of about 2.2% supported by deposit growth and the structural hedge income, while rates are expected to be lower ahead compared to the level at the end of 2025.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>This means most of its revenue pool is expected to grow at very low single digits ahead, while on the other hand, fee income has reported a much better performance over the past few quarters and is likely to remain the major top-line growth engine in the near future.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Fee and other income amounted to nearly $27 billion in 2025, representing an annual increase of close to $3.5 billion and were up by 15% YoY. This very good performance was largely supported by the Wealth segment that reported annual revenues of $9.4 billion, up by 24% YoY, driven by insurance, private banking, asset management, and investment distribution that benefited from higher valuations on the capital markets and organic growth across several business segments.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232743963735_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"823\" data-height=\"587\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232743963735_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"fee income pool\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"456\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232743963735_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232743963735_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232743963735_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232743963735_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Fee income <span>(HSBC)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>The bank expects to increase annual revenues by low single digits over the next couple of years and reach annual revenue growth of about 5% by 2028, before notable items, showing that HSBC’s growth prospects aren’t impressive over the next few years. Investors should also be aware that its reported revenue growth may be weaker than that over the coming years, as the bank continues to restructure its business and is actively pursuing further divestments of non-core units, such as the retail banking activities in Australia, Indonesia, and Egypt that can be divested in the short to medium term, and its Singapore life insurance business in a deal that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557858-hsbc-looks-to-sell-singapore-life-insurance-manufacturing-unit-in-over-1b-deal---report\">could be valued</a> at over $1 billion.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Regarding costs, the bank reported annual expenses of $36.4 billion during the last year, representing an increase of 10% compared to 2024. This figure includes some one-off items, such as $1.4 billion in litigation costs related to Madoff funds and Europe operations, and about $2 billion related to restructuring, asset disposals, and acquisition costs. Adjusted for this effect, its cost base was around $33.5 billion, representing an increase of 3% YoY, which is an acceptable development considering the inflation levels across its most important markets and the bank’s investments in technology. Considering its adjusted costs, HSBC’s cost-to-income ratio, a key measure of efficiency in the banking sector, was 49% during last year, being an acceptable level for a large bank like HSBC.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Despite that, the bank has some cost reduction measures ongoing targeting to save about $1.5 billion of annual expenses by 2027, and the recent full consolidation of Hang Seng Bank in Hong Kong is also expected to reach annual savings of about $600 million by 2028. However, to achieve these savings, the bank needs to reduce headcount, which has a negative effect in the short term regarding reported operating expenses due to severance costs, while the full-cost savings are only reflected in future financial years. Therefore, while HSBC has some significant cost reductions planned over the next couple of years, its cost base is likely to increase in 2026 with the bank expecting to report an increase of 1% excluding notable items.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Regarding asset quality, there were some concerns about potential losses related to commercial real estate (CRE) both in Hong Kong and mainland China, but HSBC’s provisions for loan losses amounted to $3.9 billion in 2025, up by just $400 million compared to 2024. Its cost of risk ratio was 39 basis points (bps), which is still within its target range of 30-40 bps over the medium term. There were indeed higher losses related to CRE in Hong Kong during the year, of about $700 million compared to $100 million in 2024, but this seems to be manageable and doesn’t put the bank’s earnings and future profit potential at risk, in my opinion. Indeed, HSBC’s guidance is to have a cost of risk ratio around 40 bps in 2026, showing that the bank is not expecting much credit deterioration ahead, and provisions for loan losses are likely to remain at similar levels to previous years over the medium term.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232751973178_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"893\" data-height=\"586\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232751973178_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart of cost of risk ratio\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"420\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232751973178_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232751973178_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232751973178_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/1104021-17721232751973178_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Provisions for loan losses <span>(HSBC)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Considering this combination of modest revenue growth, higher costs due to notable items, and slightly higher provisions for loan losses, its reported net profit amounted to $23.1 billion in 2025, down by 7% YoY. Excluding one-off items, its adjusted net profit was close to $30 billion, up by 11% from the previous year.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>While adjusted figures show a much better performance than its reported bottom line, and HSBC likes to highlight that in its presentations, I think investors should use adjusted figures with some caution, as the bank has consistently had one-off items (what the bank calls notable items) over the past few years. Between restructuring costs, litigation, and losses on asset sales, HSBC’s reported and adjusted figures are consistently different on an annual basis, and this trend is likely to continue ahead, as the bank is performing restructuring efforts in several units and is likely to continue to do asset sales, making notable items a recurring thing in its financial statements.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>While this doesn’t change the bank’s investment case in my opinion, it’s something that investors should be aware of, especially considering that HSBC’s financial targets exclude notable items and give a much better picture regarding its profitability than compared to reported figures.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Indeed, its return on tangible equity (RoTE) was 13.3% in 2025 (vs. 14.6% in 2024), while excluding notable items, it was 17.2%. This is a significant difference, and investors could assume that HSBC would easily achieve a reported RoTE above 17% over the next few years as the bank aims to, but I’m skeptical that its reported RoTE will be close to 17% in the near term, as notable items are likely to remain significant over the coming years.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Regarding its capital position, HSBC’s CET1 ratio was 14.9% at the end of 2025, being a level that is quite comfortable and above its own target range to be between 14-14.5% over the medium term. However, the bank concluded the acquisition of minority interests in Hang Seng Bank last January, having a negative impact of about 110 bps in its CET1 ratio. Adjusted to this, its CET1 should be closer to 14% in Q1 2026, a level that is now below its target range, and therefore HSBC aims to restore the capital ratio to a higher level over the coming quarters and has decided to suspend share buybacks for the time being.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>As the bank’s organic capital generation is good and its dividend payout policy is to distribute half of its earnings through dividends to shareholders, HSBC should take some quarters to have again an excess capital position, and I think share buybacks could be resumed closer to the end of this year.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>Regarding dividends, HSBC’s dividends related to its 2025 fiscal year amounted to $0.75 per share, up by 14% compared to the previous year, showing that HSBC remains committed to returning a good part of its earnings to shareholders. For U.S. investors that hold HSBC’s ADR, the total <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4556386-hsbc-holdings-declares-225ads-interim-dividend\">dividend</a> related to 2025 earnings was $3.75 per share. At its current share price, this leads to a dividend yield around 4%, which is still attractive, but it’s lower than it was in the past (around 5% when I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834267-hsbc-mixed-q3-2025-earnings-and-premium-valuation-makes-me-wary\">last covered it</a>) due to a higher share price over the last few months. This means HSBC’s income appeal is still interesting, but the bank is no longer a high-dividend yielder, being another sign, in my opinion, that its shares are somewhat overvalued.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>While HSBC Holdings Plc has reported a decent financial performance during 2025, notable items remain considerable and make its reported figures somewhat weak. Despite that, the bank is showing good progress on improving its growth prospects and streamlining its business into areas where it can get higher returns, namely in Asia, which seems to be a good strategy over the long term. The market has rewarded HSBC with a much higher valuation over the past couple of years, which is now expensive in my opinion, plus the dividend yield is no longer that high compared to some months ago. Therefore, I maintain my hold ‘rating’ on HSBC as the risk-reward proposition for long-term investors doesn’t seem to be great right now.</span></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Phenomenal. Yet, as you can see from the right side of the chart, the company shared only $4.1 billion of that (11.8%) with shareholders, and the vast majority of that was in the form of share buybacks because the dividend has also been stuck in the mud at only $0.01/share. You can barely even see the dark green dividend part of the rightmost bar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And herein lies the problem with the stock, in my opinion. The average fully diluted share count at year-end FY26 was 24.514 billion <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"versus\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">versus</em> 24.804 at year-end FY25. That is a reduction of only 1.2% yoy. Not much to crow about given <span id=\"jS$596\" class=\"j3\"><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em>'s</span> super-strong free-cash-flow profile. The fact is, <span id=\"jS$606\" class=\"j3\"><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em>'s</span> share buybacks are barely keeping pace with its stock-based compensation. In the quarterly release, the company said beginning in Q1 of fiscal 2027, it will include stock-based compensation expense in its non-GAAP financial measures. But don't let that distract you from the fact that that stock-based compensation in FY26 was $6.386 billion—up a whopping 34.8% yoy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now don't get me wrong here; I'm an engineer myself and certainly understand the need to reward and motivate talent with stock in order to attract and keep the best-of-the-best. I have no problem with that at all. However, with <span id=\"jS$711\" class=\"j3\"><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em>'s</span> massive free cash flow generation, the company is in a position to easily fully fund research, AI investments, and a strong stock-based compensation plan while also implementing a strong share buyback plan <em>and</em> giving shareholders another great reason to own the stock: strong dividend growth.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shareholder Returns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> currently only pays a token (pun intended...) quarterly dividend of $0.01/share. And that is likely only paid so that investment funds that require a company to pay a dividend can check the box and add <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> stock to their portfolios.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But consider this: NVIDIA's free cash flow in Q4 alone was $34.9 billion, and that equates to $1.42/share estimated based on the 24.514 billion average diluted share count at year-end FY26.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">$97 billion of FCF for all of FY26 equates to an estimated $3.96/share.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I argue that there is clearly a massive disconnect here in terms of <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> management directly rewarding <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> shareholders out of the massive free cash flow the company is generating—and will continue to generate. Yet on the previously referenced Q4 conference call, when analyst Timothy Arcuri of UBS Investment Bank, Research Division, pointed out these basics and asked the following:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>... you're going to probably generate about $100 billion in cash this year (but) no matter how good the results have been, the stock hasn't really gone up much ... So I was wondering if you can talk about ... why not put a big stake in the ground and just have a huge share repo here?</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> VP <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"&amp;\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">&amp;</em> CFO Collette Kress responded:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We look at our capital return very, very carefully, and we do believe that one of the most important things that we can do is really supporting the extreme ecosystem ... But of course, we are still repurchasing our stock. We are still with our dividend as well, and we will continue to find the right unique opportunities within the year for doing those different purchases.</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As soon as I heard that reply, which I consider to be weak in the extreme, I knew the chances were good that <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> stock would sell off today. Because the simple fact is this: the market is not only wondering if the companies investing in building AI data center investors are going to make a good return on their investments in <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> GPUs, <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> investors are wondering if they are ever going to directly see the benefits of the massive free cash flow the company they have invested in is generating. Right now, <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> hasn't given them a clear line of sight into those direct rewards. In fact, sticking with the theme of the title, it's a muddy picture at best.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Circular Financing</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some might consider <span id=\"jS$1160\" class=\"j3\"><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em>'s</span> constant flow of funding to customers to the tune of tens of billions of dollars (which many see as <i>“circular financing”</i>...) as a weakness and a tacit acknowledgment that, just perhaps, CEO Jensen Huang isn't really as confident in the company's future relative to the very bullish picture he keeps painting quarter after quarter on the conference calls and elsewhere. So they are likely asking the question: why isn't he buying back more <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> shares or paying a meaningful dividend directly to shareholders? Great question, in my opinion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Indeed, just today (Thursday), <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/nvidia-spent-70-billion-on-corporate-deals-to-fuel-chip-demand\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/nvidia-spent-70-billion-on-corporate-deals-to-fuel-chip-demand\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg reported</a> that <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> has spent $70 billion in FY26 on corporate deals with companies like OpenAI (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPENAI\" title=\"OpenAI\">OPENAI</a>), CoreWeave (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CRWV\" title=\"CoreWeave, Inc.\">CRWV</a>), and others to fuel GPU orders. That was more than 2x spent the prior year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Such a growth trajectory in what is arguably circular financing reminiscent of Cisco Systems prior to the dot-com meltdown has investors on edge. <span id=\"jS$1304\" class=\"j3\"><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em>'s</span> comments on this subject during the Q4 conference call that, apparently, indicate that investors should consider this strategy to go on ad infinitum. In my view, this is raising risks and undermining investor confidence in the company.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Solution</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">What is frustrating, at least for an investor like myself, is that <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> has the power to easily solve the problem and restore investor confidence in the company: announce a big, meaningful stock buyback plan that will really move the needle (i.e., on the order of $50-$100 billion), or declare a meaningful dividend and announce a significant change in the dividend policy that prioritizes dividend growth, or a rational combination of both.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For instance, a $0.10 quarterly dividend ($0.40 annually) still represents only ~10% of <em>last</em> year's free cash flow, leaving more than enough to fund the other buckets (R&amp;D, large share buybacks, AI investments). However, if <span id=\"jS$1453\" class=\"j3\"><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em>'s</span> management continues to devote the vast majority of its significantly growing free cash flow toward more circular financing corporate deals, the company cannot fund significant share buybacks or a decent dividend policy, let alone both.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Broadcom (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AVGO\" title=\"Broadcom Inc.\">AVGO</a>), on the other hand, has been averaging 10% dividend increases for years. While the current annual dividend obligation ($2.60 for a 0.78% yield) might not look like much to those unfamiliar with the company, Broadcom stock split 10:1 in 2024; otherwise, the annual dividend would be $26/share, and I can tell you from owning Broadcom stock for many years now, the yield on cost is very, very attractive. Indeed, over the past decade, Broadcom has grown the dividend at a CAGR of 30% (slide from the current company <a href=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/static-files/602c2fd3-89a0-436f-b638-4890f20feda7\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.broadcom.com/static-files/602c2fd3-89a0-436f-b638-4890f20feda7\" target=\"_blank\">presentation</a>):</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/173432-17721371103645518_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1271\" data-height=\"637\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/173432-17721371103645518_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Broadcom Dividend Growth\" width=\"640\" height=\"321\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"321\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/173432-17721371103645518_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/173432-17721371103645518_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/173432-17721371103645518_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/26/173432-17721371103645518_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Broadcom</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yet Broadcom has had no problem investing in the future, enacting a strong share-based compensation program, and continually approving strong stock buyback plans.

Interestingly enough, many shareholders are somewhat brainwashed into repeating and supporting that narrative—even though it is arguably a campaign against their own economic self-interests.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But Broadcom, Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>), Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>), and other leading technology companies have all proven that high-quality tech growth companies with strong free cash-flow profiles can, and do, pay dividends and consistently grow that dividend while still strongly investing in growth initiatives for the future. <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> is now arguably the highest free-cash-flow-generating company of all time, yet they are stuck in the mud with a $0.04 annual dividend payment—a mere pittance of the estimated $3.96/share of free cash flow the company generated in FY2026.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Summary <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"&amp;\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">&amp;</em> Conclusions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I was prepared for a sell-off in <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> stock today and took advantage of it to begin (finally) scaling into the stock with <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"two\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">two</em> purchases (I'm in at ~$188). I am now halfway to what I have allocated for a full position in the stock and will continue picking up shares until I reach that allocation. I did so based on <span id=\"jS$1886\" class=\"j3\"><em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em>'s</span> continued strong performance, its growth profile, its very strong margin and free-cash-flow profile, and primarily because its very strong Q4 networking results significantly exceeded my expectations. I also did so because with a forward P/E of only 24.9x, the stock is just too attractive to pass up for a company growing at the rate <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> is.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, if <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"nvidia\" htloopnumber=\"365160321\">NVIDIA</em> management really wants to pull the stock out of the mud and change Wall Street perception, it likely needs to communicate a big change in its shareholder returns policies: either with an announcement of a big and significant stock buyback plan or a declaration of a meaningful dividend and an accompanying dividend growth policy.</p>",

Trading remains quiet, and the general consolidative tone continues amid a relatively quiet news stream. Although US and Iranian talks are set<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to continue next week, the market remains on edge.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are three developments to note. First, the PBOC abolished the reserve requirement on foreign exchange forwards and adjusted rules to make it easier for Chinese banks to provide yuan liquidity to offshore markets. This has the effect of weakening the yuan. Second, the Danish Prime Minister has called for snap elections for next month (March 24) to secure a stronger mandate as it seeks a stronger hand to resist US pressure over Greenland. Third, the Greens won the byelection in the Gorton and Denton constituency in Great Manchester. This would seem to complicate the Labour government’s challenge, which is from both the right and left.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Prices </strong></h2> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>G10</span></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• The euro traded in a little more than a quarter-cent range around $1.18 yesterday. It remains mired in a choppy range of around $1.1740-1.1860. It is fraying the down trendline from late January (~$1.18) in this sideways movement. Options for 1.85 bln euros expire there today. A close above the 20-day moving average (~$1.1825) would help the technical tone. Short-term participants do not appear to have much conviction at the moment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• The dollar recorded an inside day against the yen and remained within Wednesday’s ~JPY155.35-156.80 range yesterday and has continued to do so today. It has chopped between about JPY155.55 and JPY156.25 today. The new nominees to the BOJ seem to undermine any threat of intervention, and the market appears likely to test the official resolve. One hindrance is that the US 10-year yield has slipped to four-month lows below 4%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• Sterling, on the other hand, posted an outside day, trading on both sides of Wednesday’s range. It settled slightly below Wednesday’s low. It tested the 200-day moving average (~$1.3450). It did so in the second half of last week, but has not settled below it since mid-January, which proved to be the bottom rather than presage a sharper decline. Options for a little more than GBP400 mln at $1.3500 expire today, which it has stayed mostly below, while at the same time, it has held above $1.3460. There was little impact from the Greens’ victory in the Greater Manchester special election.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• The US dollar posted an outside day against the Canadian dollar, but the close was within the range, neutralizing the technical signal. It was the seventh consecutive session that CAD1.37 was frayed on an intraday basis, but the greenback has not settled above it once. Still, the market does not appear to have given up. A convincing break of CAD1.3640, however, would suggest it has. So far today, it is trading in a narrow range between about CAD1.3660 and CAD1.3685.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• The Australian dollar was sold to session lows yesterday near $0.7065 in the North American morning, but recovered to a little above $0.7110 in the afternoon before consolidating. It is trading firmly but quietly today between about $0.7095 and a little more than $0.7130. Resistance is in the $0.7140-50 area. Options for nearly A$925 at $0.7080 expire today. In the futures market, the odds of a May hike are little changed this week at about 85%.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><span>EM</span></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• The Mexican peso finished softer yesterday, but its minimal loss - less than 0.2% - reflects its resilience in the face of the drawdown in US equities. In the inflation report, the central bank raised its growth forecast to 1.6% from 1.1%. The Q1 inflation projection of 4% was unchanged. Inflation is not seen reaching the 3% midpoint of the target range until Q2 '27. The range the dollar posted on Monday (~MXN17.10-MXN17.30) continues to prevail. Today, it has been confined to a MXN17.1665-17.22 range.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• The PBOC took two measures that took the wind from the yuan bulls. First, it eliminated the reserve requirement on foreign exchange forwards from 20% to zero, making foreign currency holdings more attractive. Second, it refined the banking rules and endorsed Chinese banks’ role in providing yuan liquidity to offshore markets. The dollar rose a little above CNH6.8605 today after it slipped a little below CNH6.8270 yesterday. Even with today’s minor loss, the offshore yuan rose for the fourth consecutive week, and the nearly 0.60% gain is the largest weekly advance since last August. The last time the fix rose on a weekly basis was in late November, which itself was the first time since the end of September. The dollar’s reference rate was unchanged today at CNY6.9228 yesterday.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• The dollar pushed slightly higher against the Indian rupee today. It reached a new high for the week, slightly below INR90.98. Yesterday’s high was around INR90.9250, and today’s low about INR90.9375. Separately, India revised this year’s growth forecast to 7.6% from the 7.4% projection made last month.</p> <h3 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Other Markets</strong></h3> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• Equities: Most large bourses in the Asia-Pacific region advanced. Tokyo (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NKY:IND\" title=\"NIKKEI 225 Index\">NKY:IND</a>) reached record highs. Profit-taking hit high-flying South Korean Kospi (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KOSPI\" title=\"KOSPI Index\">KOSPI</a>) and knocked it back 1%. It still rose 7% this week. Indian equities were also an exception and got tagged for more than 1%. After a minor loss yesterday, Europe’s STOXX 600 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/STOXX\" title=\"STOXX Europe 600 Index\">STOXX</a>) is posting a minor gain today. Barring a setback, it will be the fifth weekly advance. It has fallen in only one week since mid-December. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq futures (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NDX\" title=\"NASDAQ 100-Index\">NDX</a>) are off more than 1% and the S&amp;P futures (<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPX\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Futures\">SPX</a></span>) are off half as much.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• Benchmark 10-year yields are lower. Soft Tokyo inflation sent the 10-year JGB down nearly four basis points. European rates are slightly softer, while the 10-year US Treasury yield (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/US10Y\" class=\"ticker-link\">US10Y</a>) is off 1-2 bp and is down nearly 10 bp this week to below 4% for the first time since the end of last November.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• Gold is consolidating quietly between $5167 and $5200. It remains in the range set Tuesday. Silver is trading quietly within the ranges seen in the past two sessions and is a little below $90 in late-European morning turnover.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• April WTI appears to have rebuilt the weekend premium. It is near yesterday’s high (~$66.75). The high settlement this week was on Monday, around $66.30.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Data</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• US PPI inflation looks to have slowed in January. A 0.3% rise in the headline and core rate will, given the base effect, allow the year-over-year headline rate to slow to 2.6% (from 3.0%) and the core rate to 3.0% (from 3.3%). The Chicago PMI may receive some passing interest ahead of November construction spending. Construction spending was virtually flat in the first ten months of 2025, after rising by an average of 0.1% a month in the first 10 months of 2024 and a heady 1.1% monthly average in the first 10 months of 2023. The Kansas Fed’s February service survey is of little consequence to the market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• Canada will report December GDP, which is seen growing by 0.1% after a flat November. It is unlikely to deter a small contraction in Q4 (-0.2% annualized, according to the median forecast in Bloomberg’s survey) after 2.6% expansion in Q3.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• Mexico’s trade balance displays a strong seasonal pattern toward deterioration in January. It has done so for the past 14 years without fail. It is expected to have done so last month. Last year, Mexico’s exports rose by about 7.6%, while imports rose by almost 4.4%. Mexico’s trade balance swung into a surplus of around $770 mln last year from an $18.54 bln deficit in 2024.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• The ECB’s inflation survey showed a minor change in inflation expectations. The one-year outlook eased to 2.6% from 2.8%, and the three-year outlook was unchanged at 2.6%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• Australia’s private sector credit growth remained robust in January, rising by 0.5%. It accelerated in H2 '25 and appears to be one of the factors that underpin expectations of additional tightening by the central bank.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">• Japan reported several important data points. First, the February Tokyo CPI, a harbinger of the national figures, edged up to 1.6% from 1.5% and the core rate eased to 1.8% from 2.0%, helped by new energy subsidies. It is the lowest core reading since April 2024. It peaked last May at 3.6%. Second, retail sales bounced back 4.1% after they fell by 2.0% in December. Third, industrial production surged 2.2% in January (-0.1% in December).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><a href=\"https://www.marctomarket.com/2026/02/pboc-steadies-yuan-denmark-calls-snap.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Original Post</em></a></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Editor's Note:</strong> The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.</p>",
