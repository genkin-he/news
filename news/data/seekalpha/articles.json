As such, when tech stocks (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XLK\" title=\"State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF\">XLK</a>) are soaring, QQQ outperforms QQQI. However, in a market where they flounder, QQQI tends to outperform QQQ. Given that recently increasing caution has been put on mega-cap tech stocks due to their massive AI CapEx commitments this year with uncertain return profiles, and there are major concerns about valuations and AI disruption of the software industry, QQQ has been floundering, which means that the covered calls that QQQI employs are helping it to outperform by giving it additional cash flow without having to forfeit much, if anything, in the way of upside so far this year. This is exactly the type of environment where covered call strategies shine.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, what about moving forward? Should investors continue to play QQQI, or should they switch back to QQQ, or perhaps should they avoid mega-cap tech altogether? In this article, I will break down QQQI in more detail and share my take on the stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Structural Flaws That Could Undermine Long-Term Returns</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I last wrote about QQQI back in December, when I highlighted how the yield looks great, and the performance looks great, yet there are some <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4855991-qqqi-13-percent-yield-looks-perfect-until-you-dig-into-details\">structural flaws</a> that will lead to long-term total return underperformance. These include the relatively high expense ratio of 0.68%, the fact that its performance looks artificially good, given that, since its inception, its underlying index has performed very well, and it has only been in business a little over two years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, while its monthly distributions and its high annual yield of over 1% per month in payouts look extremely attractive, its SEC yield is microscopic, which means that it is generating virtually all of its yield from premiums that it earns from writing covered calls against its underlying holdings. This means that nearly all of its distributions amount to a return of capital. Additionally, even while much is made of the active management and its ability to dynamically manage the portfolio to preserve upside during bull markets to keep the ETF from falling too far behind, even year to date with a relatively sideways to even declining QQQ, QQQI has still seen its principal decline by more than QQQ has, showing that even in a relatively ideal scenario, it can still see its NAV erode more than its underlying index. This shows that its options-writing strategy does consistently eat into the NAV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_d8a636eb89095ed49ac399d2d39789f0.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_d8a636eb89095ed49ac399d2d39789f0.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_d8a636eb89095ed49ac399d2d39789f0.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_d8a636eb89095ed49ac399d2d39789f0.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Thus, you will need a long-term bull market in QQQ and avoid too much sharp volatility for QQQI to preserve and grow NAV over time on top of its attractive distributions. This is especially true given that its top holdings and its general portfolio construction closely mirror QQQ’s, so that gives it an underlying equity risk and overweight tech exposure that is essentially the same.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/52820996-17722315454511085_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1150\" data-height=\"796\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/52820996-17722315454511085_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"QQQI Holdings\" width=\"640\" height=\"443\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"443\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/52820996-17722315454511085_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/52820996-17722315454511085_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/52820996-17722315454511085_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/52820996-17722315454511085_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">QQQI Holdings <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI CapEx, Valuations, And The Shifting Macro Backdrop</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The macro factors that have driven QQQI’s strong total return performance over time are bullish for tech, which has also led to it underperforming QQQ. However, recently, it has outperformed QQQ because some of these factors have shifted, namely that AI enthusiasm is tempered somewhat, investors are now looking more closely at valuations as well as returns on massive AI CapEx investments, and software is increasingly being viewed through a critical lens as a likely candidate for disruption from AI innovations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This means that QQQ has seen its performance weakened considerably relative to dividend stocks, as evidenced by the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SCHD\" title=\"Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF\">SCHD</a>)’s significant outperformance of QQQ over the past three months, while QQQI has only moderately tempered that weakness through its options-writing strategy and has still trailed SCHD by a huge margin over that time period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bf1aead3ed1fc3c876785779d1da7671.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bf1aead3ed1fc3c876785779d1da7671.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bf1aead3ed1fc3c876785779d1da7671.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/saupload_bf1aead3ed1fc3c876785779d1da7671.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Given that tech valuations remain far from what I would consider bargain territory and we are still early on in the AI CapEx cycle, as well as the potential for software disruption, I do not think that QQQ is at all appealing relative to QQQI right now. And so, therefore, if presented with the two and trying to gain things over a relatively short- to medium-term horizon, I would continue to favor QQQI and other NASDAQ-focused covered call ETFs.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, there are important trade-offs that need to be kept in mind. First of all, if we were to see a material pullback of QQQ into correction territory, I would probably switch from QQQI to QQQ to avoid missing out on a strong bounce back, since covered calls would temper that and potentially lock in long-term losses.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Better Income Alternatives With Stronger Risk-Reward Profiles</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, it is worth questioning whether you should have much exposure to any tech fund at all right now, given the valuations and macro factors already mentioned, especially since you can also buy dividend-paying stocks on a value basis that are enjoying macro tailwinds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For example, you can buy <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4876562-the-ultimate-8-percent-yielding-sleep-well-at-night-retirement-income-machine\">several high-quality, investment-grade midstreams</a> that are benefiting from AI CapEx and do not suffer from uncertain AI return risks as the mega-cap techs do, while generating, in some cases, up to a 9% yield and enjoying inflation-beating growth, while also trading at single-digit valuation multiples. Even in ETF format, you can buy the Alerian MLP ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMLP\" title=\"Alerian MLP ETF\">AMLP</a>) with a near 8% yield and a strong recent dividend growth history.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Additionally, you can buy <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4853261-7-8-percent-yielding-utf-one-of-best-infrastructure-income-opportunities-upgrade\">high-yield funds</a> like the Cohen &amp; Steers Infrastructure Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/UTF\" title=\"Cohen &amp; Steers Infrastructure Fund Inc\">UTF</a>) that offer mid- to high-single-digit yields and even broader diversification across AI-related infrastructure. Moreover, you can buy high-quality, conservative, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4873260-saaspocalypse-created-one-of-best-11-percent-plus-yielding-opportunities\">senior secured software lenders</a> at deep discounts to NAV and dividend yields that compare very nicely with QQQI’s while enjoying a steep discount to NAV and a more conservative profile in terms of exposure to software given their senior secured lending stance at loan-to-values of between the mid-teens and the 30s rather than having straight-up equity exposure to richly valued software companies that occupy a substantial portion of QQQ and QQQI’s portfolios. Not only that, but you get these yields without the covered call caps on upside potential.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result, while I think that QQQI is a better play than QQQ in the current environment, I am steering clear of both in favor of much more attractively valued and risk-positioned opportunities in the midstream and software lending space in my 7-8% yielding, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/52820996-high-yield-investor/6260770-our-portfolio-track-record-results-through-february-14-2026\">total return outperforming,</a> and below-market beta portfolios at <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/mp/1369-high-yield-investor\">High Yield Investor</a>.</p>",

It has an internal brand incubator called <a href=\"https://www.oddity.com/about\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.oddity.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">New Ventures</a>, launched in 2019, created to develop and test new product categories using ODD’s technology, which includes data science for customer segmentation and product strategy. Likewise, this pipeline optimizes for responsive digital marketing for testing of ads and offers with creative iterations, as well as molecular discovery for screening potential ingredients. In fact, ODD’s incubator also predicts the product’s properties and uses hyperspectral vision for capturing images to make more precise skin analysis for improved diagnostics.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277894232457_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"861\" data-height=\"478\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277894232457_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Earnings Presentation.

These tools improve product matching, marketing efficiency, and product development. Plus, they use a layer of <a href=\"https://investors.oddity.com/static-files/fb1c708c-a78b-49d7-87f5-9cc3629fc147\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.oddity.com/static-files/fb1c708c-a78b-49d7-87f5-9cc3629fc147\" target=\"_blank\">shared data</a> that feeds across their platforms. The company states that they’ve so far collected over 2 billion individual signals from 68 million users, like quiz answers, shade and skin inputs, browsing behavior, purchases, and others. And ODD flags this as a competitive advantage because, as more users generate data, this loops back into their machine learning models for better conversion, retention, and efficiency, which is at the core of their growth flywheel.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation And Risk Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, from a valuation perspective, ODD currently trades at a $790.7 million market cap. Its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/19181317\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/19181317\" target=\"_blank\">latest 6-K</a> shows they ended 2025 with $402.2 million in cash and $373.7 million in marketable securities (short and long term). That amounts to approximately $775.9 million in liquid resources against $584.4 million in financial debt (exchangeable note). Using those figures, I estimate ODD’s EV at roughly $599.2 million. And if we compare it to its Q4 revenues of $152.7 million (annualized $610.8 million), it implies a quite cheap EV/S of 1.0. For comparison, their sector’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ODD/valuation/metrics\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ODD/valuation/metrics\" target=\"_blank\">median EV/S</a> is much closer to 1.5, so it would appear that investors are likely pricing in a major contraction in their topline or margin deterioration.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277894641037_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1061\" data-height=\"572\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277894641037_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Earnings Presentation.

February 2026.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With that in mind, that brings <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"us\" htloopnumber=\"853036071\">us</em> to ODD’s recently significant abnormal <a href=\"https://investors.oddity.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oddity-tech-reports-record-full-year-2025-results\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.oddity.com/news-releases/news-release-details/oddity-tech-reports-record-full-year-2025-results\" target=\"_blank\">increase</a> in user acquisition cost (UAC). For a digital-first DTC company, paid ads are a core growth lever. If UAC spikes unexpectedly, growth can slow, and margins can compress. ODD also stated that the dislocation was tied to META’s changes related to its ad delivery and targeting algorithm. And naturally, this now casts doubts about ODD’s <a href=\"https://dkeithwilson.com/research/zynga-case-study/\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://dkeithwilson.com/research/zynga-case-study/\" target=\"_blank\">platform risk</a> and its dependence on META. After all, a good example of platform risk was Zynga, which was another rapidly growing company that relied heavily on META. Yet, after META implemented changes to its mobile gaming policies, Zynga’s business quickly dwindled.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So it’s unsurprising to see that <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557790-oddity-tech-falls-again-after-bull-ratings-are-pulled-on-wall-street\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557790-oddity-tech-falls-again-after-bull-ratings-are-pulled-on-wall-street\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street downgraded</a> ODD, and Bank of America warned that the problem is widespread, affecting acquisitions broadly across brands. Beauty is competitive, and if online acquisition becomes less efficient, brands with a strong retail presence may gain the upper hand in acquiring customers physically relative to online discovery. For example, companies like Sephora and Ulta, among others, don't rely as heavily on online channels.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277895320947_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1278\" data-height=\"719\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722277895320947_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Earnings Presentation.

February 2026.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Therefore, ODD could be at risk of losing considerable market share if it can’t adapt and acquire new customers. But, <a href=\"https://investors.oddity.com/static-files/fb1c708c-a78b-49d7-87f5-9cc3629fc147\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.oddity.com/static-files/fb1c708c-a78b-49d7-87f5-9cc3629fc147\" target=\"_blank\">historically</a>, ODD’s revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth have been consistent. And even if it were to level off at where it is today, it would suggest that ODD may be a viable contrarian “<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"853036071\">buy</em>” despite the prevailing pessimistic sentiment. However, if I instead add their <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/19181317\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/19181317\" target=\"_blank\">2025 cash flows</a> from operations and CAPEX (a cash burn proxy), it would appear ODD remains cash flow positive, but to a lesser extent. Using this approach, I estimate ODD generated approximately $83.6 million in 2025, which showcases they’re not in a death spiral stage just yet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But it’s worth mentioning that, so far, Meta hasn’t published a note explaining what they have changed in detail, which could help explain ODD’s current conversion issues. ODD said that the <a href=\"https://investors.oddity.com/static-files/2f1638d6-7525-448b-aacf-da1fae2879b6\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://investors.oddity.com/static-files/2f1638d6-7525-448b-aacf-da1fae2879b6\" target=\"_blank\">algorithm</a> diverted it to lower-quality auctions at abnormally high costs, meaning that ad placements convert less because they are directed to audiences that are less likely to <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"853036071\">buy</em>. Moreover, auctions are not only less productive but also more expensive compared to historical performance.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772227791258213_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1316\" data-height=\"747\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772227791258213_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Earnings Presentation.

February 2026.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In fact, ODD may need to diversify across channels with ads through Google, TikTok, affiliates, influencers, and partnerships to reduce its dependence on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874828-oddity-tech-ltd-odd-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4874828-oddity-tech-ltd-odd-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">Meta</a>. However, as you might imagine, these types of changes are structural and will likely require a longer repair cycle. ODD may even need to rethink its whole marketing strategy, as ads on Google work differently from ads on <em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"facebook\" htloopnumber=\"853036071\">Facebook</em> or Instagram. Also, according to Bank of America, a more concrete solution for ODD’s marketing issues may take at least until 2027 to show results.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Cautious Contrarian “<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"853036071\">Buy</em>”</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, I feel ODD’s business is now definitely challenged. The reality is that we don’t know yet the true extent of their problems that may arise from Meta’s recent policy changes. If we later learn that ODD can make a few tweaks and continue operating as usual, then I think the stock would bounce very quickly. On the other hand, if Meta’s changes are structural and require a fundamental pivot in the way ODD conducts its marketing strategy, then this contrarian “<em class=\"Highlight ht79a4880e-46ec-47bf-a380-61791df97731\" highlight=\"true\" htmatch=\"buy\" htloopnumber=\"853036071\">Buy</em>” may take much longer to fully play out. However, at such a deep discount, I feel ODD is now worth speculating with a small bullish position at these levels. Just make sure you keep your position sizing under control.</p>",

After thinking over the issue for a few days, we felt that the analysis could use a follow-up. That analysis focused more on pointing out the flaws of common indicators such as high P/E without really offering alternative ideas to diagnose the market.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With this background, our goal in this article is quite simple. I will explain why and how I use junk bond rates as a leading signal for the equity market. I’ve been experimenting with this idea for more than a decade by now, and my winning odds are good. The ideas apply to all major equity indices I’ve experimented with (such as the <span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DJI\" title=\"Dow Jones Industrial Average Index\">DJI</a></span>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\">SP500</a>, and <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COMP:IND\">NASDAQ</a>, and also small cap (RTY)). But for the sake of brevity, this article will use the SP500 index as the primary example.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I assume most investors can agree on the close relationship between corporate bonds and stocks. There are simply the two sides of the same coin. As such, I will focus my attention on explaining why I particularly like to use junk bonds but no other bonds (say, investment-grade bonds). In a nutshell, I am more interested in junk bond rates because A) they change more sensitively to corporate fundamentals, and B) they serve as a more effective depth indicator than bonds with better investment grades. In our experience, many (probably most) investors hold sizable bond positions of treasury and investment grade bonds regardless of market conditions. But due to their weaker credit ratings, junk bond rates change sensitivity to investors’ risk appetite. When junk bond yields are unusually low, it indicates to me that investors’ risk appetite has expanded to include assets with questionable financial strength. I am not usually too worried about assets with high quality (like the Mag 7) trading at high multiples. But when assets of sub-par qualities are also trading with a premium, I begin to be concerned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the above understanding, let’s examine the current status of junk bond rates and analyze the implications for the SP500.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Historical perspective</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To provide the perspective needed in this article, I first need to find junk rates data for a sufficiently long period of time. For the purpose, the chart below displays the dividend yield from the Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund Investor Shares (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VWEHX\" title=\"Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Fund Investor\">VWEHX</a>). The VWEHX mutual fund is the oldest junk bond fund I can find, with data dating back to 1978, as seen.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087769289606_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1554\" data-height=\"509\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087769289606_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"210\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087769289606_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087769289606_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087769289606_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087769289606_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Per the fund's latest discourse as of Dec 31, 2025 (see the next chart below), VWEHX’s exposure is heavily concentrated in below-investment-grade corporate bonds. Its largest exposure is corporate bonds with BB credit ratings, which account for more than half of its total assets (51.5%). The second largest exposure is toward bonds with a B- credit rating, representing about 1/3 of its total assets (31.5%).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the long term, the historical average of the fund’s yield is around 7.76%, as shown. The yield has dipped to as low as about 4.1% amid the epic easing during the COVID pandemic. The yield has climbed up substantially since then and is currently hovering around 6.18%. It is thus lower than the historical average, but not to an alarming degree. And we will further explore the implications next.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-1772208776999011_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1645\" data-height=\"826\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-1772208776999011_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"321\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-1772208776999011_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-1772208776999011_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-1772208776999011_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-1772208776999011_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Vanguard</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Junk bond yield as a leading signal</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To explore the long-term effectiveness of junk bond yields as a leading signal for the equity market, I will need the long-term performance of an equity index fund. On this front, the oldest fund I can find is the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VFIAX\" title=\"Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral\">VFIAX</a>). As a fun fact, when John Bogle first launched the fund in 1976, the fund was mocked as \"Bogle's Folly\" because critics couldn't believe investors would settle for a fund that \"only\" provides average market returns by design.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, the top panel of the next chart shows the price movement of VFIAX in terms of price corrections off high. The bottom panel shows the yield spread of VWEHX relative to fed fund rates approximated by 3-month treasury rates. A quite clear correlation (that is, an inverse correlation) can be seen even from a visual examination between these two panels. The green and red arrows highlighted a few key market events that played a definitive role in the SP500’s returns in the past 50 years or so. These key events included the formation and burst of the dot-com bubble, the 2008 financial crisis, the 2010 European bank crisis, the monetary easing following the COVID-19 breakout, and the subsequent tightening. As seen, amid all key junctures, when the junk bond rates are unusually low relative to risk-free rates, as indicated by the green arrows, the SP500 index suffered a sharp correction shortly afterward due to the fundamental dynamics mentioned in the first section. Such unusually low junk bond rates suggest that the market’s risk appetite has swung too far to the greedy extreme. And the opposite is also true, as highlighted by the red arrows.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087772304945_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"2419\" data-height=\"1579\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087772304945_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"418\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087772304945_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087772304945_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087772304945_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087772304945_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Seeking Alpha</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Other risks and final thoughts</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">If history does rhyme, you can see why I am not too alarmed by the current market conditions. As mentioned earlier, junk bond rates are currently below average but not alarmingly so. The current spread between VWEHX and 3-month treasury rates gave me a very similar assessment. As seen, the current yield spread sits at 2.492%. The bad news for equity investors is that it is below the historical average of 4.83%. The good news is that the spread has thickened considerably from its recent trough and is no longer alarmingly thin. Furthermore, the latest dot plot, announced by the <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/money/federal-open-market-committee\" rel=\"nofollow\">Federal Open Market Committee</a> in Dec 2025, shows a path of continued cuts to the fed fund rates in the near future. As you can see from the following screenshot, the dot plot suggests the median expectation of the fed funds rate to decrease from the current level of around 3.6% to around 3.0% in 2027. With everything else being equal, such a decrease could further thicken the yield spread between VWEHX and 3-month treasury rates to about 3.1%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To close, the goal of this article is mainly twofold. First, I want to offer an alternative idea, the use of junk bond rates, for investors to diagnose the equity (beyond P/E ratios and rolling-returns in past years). Second, I want to apply this idea to the current market conditions. My diagnosis is that current junk bond rates certainly are on the lower end and worth closely monitoring. But I do not believe it is to an alarming degree to trigger a dramatic departure from the SP500 or other equity index.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087770125518_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087770125518_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"chart\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087770125518_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087770125518_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087770125518_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48844541-17722087770125518_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>FOMC</span></p></figcaption></figure></p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IQV\" title=\"IQVIA Holdings Inc.\">IQV</a></span>) <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4803215-iqvia-q2-earnings-exceeded-my-expectations\">article</a>, where I covered the company’s Q2 earnings beat thanks to $4.017B in revenue, driven by growth in the Technology &amp; Analytics Solutions (TAS) segment. I<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> pointed out that despite the market’s pessimism, the company’s profitability continues to be their leading highlight, as high cash flow conversions boosted their adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Accordingly, the company reaffirmed their full-year outlook despite the volatility and uncertainties of the biotech sector’s R&amp;D environment. So, I was bullish on IQVIA heading into the back half of 2025 and expected the company to keep feasting on their current bookings and backlog to fuel their growth.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, <a href=\"https://ir.iqvia.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2026/IQVIA-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2025-Results-Issues-Full-Year-2026-Guidance/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">IQVIA's Q4 earnings</a> confirmed that thesis with a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4547802-iqvia-non-gaap-eps-of-3_42-beats-by-0_02-revenue-of-4_36b-beats-by-120m\">beat</a> on EPS and revenue. Plus, the company finished the year with an acceleration in R&amp;DS bookings and an expansion of their backlog. However, management posted what I would say was typical guidance for 2026 with routine increases in revenue and EPS. The company’s EPS guidance was below the Street’s consensus, which led to analysts revising their target downward and the market <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4547971-iqvia-stock-slides-after-q4-results-outlook\">responding</a> accordingly. As a result, IQV is trading in the $160-$170 per share range after trading above $240 per share about a month ago. I’m looking to take advantage of the recent discount on IQV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I intend to review what we saw earlier in 2025, review what the Street was expecting heading into Q4, and then compare that to what IQVIA’s results were. In addition, I will highlight a few risks that investors should consider when managing their position. Finally, I will take a look at the charts to see how I can manage my position post-earnings.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Q1–Q3 Recap</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking back at IQVIA’s Q1-Q3 performance, the company logged steady growth thanks to a combination of the durable TAS segment and sustained efforts in the R&amp;DS. The company did stress that macroeconomic conditions continue to impact the CRO arena; however, they were still seeing deferred demand for their services rather than outright cancellations. That was evident in their Q4 earnings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Throughout 2025, the TAS segment’s growth was fueled by customers still turning to IQVIA for data and support. Despite the macro headwinds, it is clear that IQVIA remains an industry leader for these services and is embedded in customer workflows. Meanwhile, R&amp;DS was able to make the best of delayed trial starts and cautious spending. Moreover, the company’s backlog composition improved with the skew moving toward late-phase trials, which have higher lifetime values.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As I mentioned in the introduction, the company’s profitability metrics remain the primary highlight. Not only did their margins hold up, but IQVIA is still elite at converting their earnings into cash. The company's cash conversion rate has generated enough capital flexibility to repurchase shares while still servicing their debt, and investing in innovation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Essentially, the Q1-Q3 results earlier in the year supported my bull thesis that IQVIA had already evolved beyond a traditional CRO, and is now becoming a hybrid as they continue to expand on their data, analytics, and clinical execution platform. What is more, that development set Q4 up to be the biggest quarter since the COVID era.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Q4 and Full-Year 2025 Review</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">IQVIA’s Q4 numbers verified some reassuring narratives and trends. The company’s revenue acceleration in Q4 was powered by <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4866507-iqvia-holdings-inc-iqv-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">increases</a> in R&amp;DS booking activity and TAS deal flow. Similar to Q1-Q3, the growth came across segments, rather than a single business segment benefiting from a one-off deal or a dramatic change in the healthcare industry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072293787_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1002\" data-height=\"417\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072293787_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IQVIA Q4 Earnings Summary\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"266\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072293787_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072293787_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072293787_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072293787_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IQVIA Q4 Earnings Summary <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Diving into the TAS segment, IQVIA customers are continuing to employ AI-enabled analytics, solutions, and tools. It looks as if the company has developed some valuable services in the TAS portfolio that are becoming vital for their customers to navigate product launches and manage pricing dynamics. As for the R&amp;DS segment, the company reported the strongest bookings quarter of the year, which suggests that sector’s pipeline activity is beginning to percolate back to normal levels as sponsors regain confidence in funding and a clearer horizon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Once again, the company’s book-to-bill and backlog growth remain a highlight aspect. IQVIA has an immense backlog of $32.7B, which they expect to convert to about $8.3B over the next twelve months, which gives IQVIA and investors assured revenue visibility going into 2027.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Last but not least, IQVIA’s profitability grades remain stellar, with Q4 adjusted EBITDA rising above $1B, and their full-year EBITDA right near the top end of expectations. I will also circle that their adjusted EPS growth continued despite higher interest expense. The company’s cash flow performance is still in championship form, with near-100% conversion of adjusted net income into free cash flow, which is not only jaw-dropping on its own but will allow the company to be aggressive with their bankroll in terms of growth initiatives, keep paying down debt, and still commit to share repurchases.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>My Take </strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, I would say IQVIA’s Q4/2025 earnings reinforced my expectations for 2025 and my bullish outlook for the long-term. I will concede that projecting IQVIA’s performance over 2025 did not take financial genius because the company has a strong track record of outperforming expectations, as well as impressive profitability metrics, and billions in backlog to be worked through.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-1772221907293571_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1052\" data-height=\"487\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-1772221907293571_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IQVIA Earnings History\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"296\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-1772221907293571_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-1772221907293571_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-1772221907293571_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-1772221907293571_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IQVIA Earnings History <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>So what is my point?</em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Well, IQVIA is an industry leader that provides vital services that make the healthcare sector turn. The company has expanded their offering to be involved from the inception through commercialization. So not only can the company benefit from being the customer’s trusted ally for every phase of a project’s lifespan, but IQVIA now has a rough forecast for years, or possibly decades. So, no one should be surprised by the company showing a reacceleration in growth, and it has yet to hit their ceiling. The Street is expecting the company to report single-digit EPS growth for 2026, but will return to double-digit EPS growth going into the next decade.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071734617_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1051\" data-height=\"297\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"false\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"false\" data-og-image-msn=\"false\" data-og-image-facebook=\"false\" data-og-image-google_news=\"false\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"false\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"false\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071734617_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IQVIA Annual EPS Estimates\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"181\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071734617_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071734617_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071734617_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071734617_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IQVIA Annual EPS Estimates <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As for revenue, analysts are projecting IQVIA to report mid-single-digit to low-double-digit growth going into the middle of the 2030s.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219073354301_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1051\" data-height=\"393\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219073354301_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IQVIA Annual Revenue Estimates\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"239\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219073354301_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219073354301_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219073354301_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219073354301_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IQVIA Annual Revenue Estimates <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, it would seem as if the Street is confident that IQVIA will not only survive the current macro uncertainties but also has the potential to possibly double their earnings over the next ten years. Certainly, these numbers are not breakneck hypergrowth, but I would like to remind you that IQVIA has impressive profitability metrics that allow them to maximize every tenth of a percentage point of growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071903234_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"720\" data-height=\"394\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071903234_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IQVIA Profitability Metrics\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"350\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071903234_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071903234_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071903234_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219071903234_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IQVIA Profitability Metrics <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I understand that healthcare investors are not looking for single-digit top-line growth from a healthcare company, but the high profitability and strong free cash generation make IQVIA act like a stealth compounder. This combination of efficiency and financial leverage can allow IQVIA to outstrip some of the higher-growth peers who are closer to a “hand-to-mouth” and who use a higher portion of their revenue just to fund operations or growth.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yes, the share buybacks might be seen as a form of financial engineering that equates to EPS growth, but I don’t think this is a superficial action by management. We cannot overlook that IQVIA has high-profitability metrics and a hefty bank account that can be used to maximize shareholder value without sabotaging their financials or long-term outlook.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Again, this is something that has been evident throughout 2025 and is clearly mapped out for the foreseeable future.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Risks to Consider</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although I’m bullish on IQVIA’s long-term outlook thanks to bookings and backlog, I must admit that the company is still going to have to deal with current healthcare headwinds that have delayed clinical trials, constricted biotech funding, as well as general regulatory or political risks. These headwinds could weigh on near-term R&amp;D execution for a prolonged period of time. It is possible these headwinds become the new norm, IQVIA’s growth prospects are blunted.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I will note that leverage remains a risk to consider, with their total debt at around $16.31B. However, their consistent cash flow generation and disciplined use of their capital diminish the likelihood that debt becomes a big constraint.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Perhaps the biggest risk to investors is really the recent damage to the growth narrative. As I have mentioned in my previous IQV articles, the company experienced absurd growth during COVID, which set a high watermark for a few years.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072035432_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"710\" data-height=\"408\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072035432_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"IQVIA Growth Grade\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"368\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072035432_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072035432_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072035432_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/48523746-17722219072035432_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">IQVIA Growth Grade <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company has started to show resurgence in 2025, but the growth metrics are going to be living in the shadow of the COVID era.

On the safer side, I could wait for the ticker to turn bullish on the Go-No-Go indicator and for the share price to breach the January 2026 anchored VWAP before adding to the position.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Once I have my fill, I will look to book profits around my Sell Target 1 of $297 per share in order to move my position closer to a \"house money\" status and hold for a long-term investment.</p>",

As the largest company in the world reports its earnings, it gives us a<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> direct view into the definitive data set for evaluating the health of the AI infrastructure build-out. With that in mind, I’ll review my current rating of the company to assess if it is still one of the great opportunities on the market despite its vast size.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Current Dynamics</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557159-nvidia-non-gaap-eps-of-1_62-beats-by-0_08-revenue-of-68_13b-beats-by-1_9b\">announced yet another double beat</a>, with Non-GAAP EPS of $1.62, a slight beat of 8 cents by NVIDIA’s standards. Revenue came in at $68.13B for the quarter, also a beat of $1.9B and an eye-watering 73% Y/Y increase and a Q/Q improvement of 20%, which is simply crazy considering the size of the company. This suggests that the virtuous cycle of AI adoption remains in its early-to-middle stages, even as the market is currently grappling with concerns about the sustained CapEX. In total, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/171344939\">FY revenue came out at $215.9B</a>, up 65% from fiscal 2025. Gross margin stood at 75%, reflecting exceptional pricing power despite the massive R&amp;D and manufacturing costs associated with leading-edge 3nm and 4nm process nodes. On a FY basis, the small compression in gross margins is linked to a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/399456576_The_Global_Computing_Power_Game_NVIDIA's_Profit_Structure_and_China's_Domestic_Substitution_Under_the_'Chip_Tax'\" rel=\"nofollow\">$4.5B inventory charge recognized in Q1</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We can clearly see that NVIDIA is becoming more and more concentrated as the data center segment now accounts for approximately 91.5% of the total top-line, underscoring the industry’s shift from classical machine learning to gen AI. The segment alone generated $62.3B in quarterly revenue, thanks to the sustained strength of the Blackwell architecture ramp and the Blackwell Ultra platform. Overall, the company generated $97B in free cash flow, which is simply staggering, considering where the figure was only a couple of years ago.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Diving deeper segment-wise, the current dominance in the DC segment is not a result of chip sales but a consequence of NVIDIA’s evolution into a full-stack provider of entire data-center -scale computing platforms. This has been highlighted by the surge in networking revenue, which has totaled $11B in Q4, a 263% increase compared to the prior year. This growth reflects the transition from isolated GPU deployments to gigascale AI factories where inter-chip communication is as critical as the compute itself. The networking business has scaled more than tenfold since fiscal 2021, <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-to-acquire-mellanox-for-6-9-billion\" rel=\"nofollow\">after NVIDIA acquired Mellanox</a>. And though you could see a risk in NVIDIA being so reliant on Data center revenue, it is actually increasingly diversifying its customer base away from traditional hyperscalers such as Microsoft (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MSFT\" title=\"Microsoft Corporation\">MSFT</a>) and Amazon (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>). That would be related to demand from AI model makers, enterprises and sovereign nations that is accelerating, suggesting that the AI build-out is broadening beyond a handful of tech giants. And this simple dynamic is critical in mitigating the potential risk of an incoming spending digesting period among the top hyperscalers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I also want to touch on sovereign AI, which has been deemed the new geopolitical asset class and is one of the most striking trends in fiscal 2026. The segment involves individual nations in building domestic GPU clusters to ensure that they are not digitally colonized by offshore providers. This has become critical as it tripled in revenue during the year, surpassing $30B. For example, in Japan, <a href=\"https://www.softbank.jp/en/corp/news/press/sbkk/2025/20250723_01/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Softbank is deploying over 10,000 Blackwell GPUs</a> in a revolutionary AI Grid that integrates processing directly into the 5G cellular network. This will allow for low-latency processing for robotics and autonomous vehicles without data ever leaving domestic soil.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I want to say that the quarter has been strong for NVIDIA, yet the market has punished it rather severly considering its beat all around, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4557606-nvidia-stands-alone-upbeat-outlook-sends-stock-higher-leaving-mag-7-in-the-red\">by shedding nearly 5.5%</a>. The guidance was also great for Q1 of the company’s fiscal 2027, as it guided for revenue to $78B + or – 2%, which would imply a Y/Y growth rate of 77%. Mainly, I believe that the stock dropped as investors were looking at more than what was characterized as an uneventful report. This is inherently linked to the perceived risks of massive spending in the industry, as some hyperscaler capex is approaching nearly 100% of operating cash flow in some cases. In a way, investors are expecting more than perfection, which is already what NVIDIA is delivering.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the stock dropping while revenue keeps growing at a relentless pace, it means that NVDA is actually becoming cheaper; even at a P/E Non-GAAP of 40.91, it is actually trending at the middle of its peers' range and historically speaking, one of the lowest levels seen since 2019. The company is also seeing its FCF yield tick up as it now reaches 2.1%, as the company continues to be an incredible free cash flow generator. On a forward basis, I believe that it is crazy that NVIDIA is priced at a forward P/E of 23.05, considering its growth and its guidance that will certainly be exceeded in the coming quarter. That would be lower than companies like Oracle (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ORCL\" title=\"Oracle Corporation\">ORCL</a>) at 26.95, and far lower than its closest competitor, AMD, at 48.84. Taking into account a fair ratio that will account for margin strength and market cap, the company's fair P/E would be at around 57x, suggesting that the current levels are pricing in far less optimism than the fundamentals support.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Outside of its clear moat in hardware, I believe that one of the key advantages of NVIDIA has been its actual software moat, as the firm remains deep in the realm of deployment and inference. This will help in defending CUDA against AMD’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMD\" title=\"Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\">AMD</a>) <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/products/software/rocm.html\" rel=\"noopener\">ROCm software stack</a>, which has significantly closed the gap. As the market shifts toward Agentic AI, that requires complex reasoning and low-latency response, the full-stack optimization that the company has been undergoing now provides a productivity advantage.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61549894-17721907179161835.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Graph valuation NVIDIA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"476\" height=\"253\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61549894-17721907179161835.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61549894-17721907179161835.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Valuation Metrics <span>(Data from Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Though the company has a large base of potential great growth opportunities, I believe that one that will be key will be the Rubin Architecture and the subsequent inference revolution. The <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/vera-rubin-nvl72/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vera Rubin platform</a> is set to enter mass production in early 2026, ahead of schedule. Rubin is engineered to reduce AI inference token costs by 10x compared to the Blackwell architecture, which will be critical as the industry shifts from training large models to running autonomous agentic AI systems 24/7. Rubin will also integrate HBM4 memory, providing 22 TB/s of bandwidth per GPU, a 2.75x to 2.8x increase over the Blackwell architecture. Internal benchmarks have been suggesting that while a 5MM investment in current infrastructure might generate a certain level of token revenue, a Rubin-based AI factory can produce the same <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/rubin-platform-ai-supercomputer\" rel=\"nofollow\">output for one-tenth the cost</a>. This drop in costs is to make high-level reasoning economically viable for enterprises.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61549894-17721907674761102.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Graph Growth NVIDIA\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"477\" height=\"287\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61549894-17721907674761102.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/61549894-17721907674761102.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Growth Metrics <span>(Data from SA)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest risk to NVIDIA’s growth narrative would be the sustainability of the massive spending currently underway by its largest customers. Those giants are projected to spend up to $690B on AI infrastructure in 2026, there is a growing concern that this hasn’t translated into broad-based corporate profits. Plus, CapEX is approaching nearly all of their operating cash flows. If the companies do not see a clear path to monetization, they may enter a digestion period, leading to a sudden revenue plateau.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">NVIDIA’s market share in AI accelerators is also facing a double assault from both the ASIC revolution and AMD. On the ASIC side, it comes from customers designing their own vertically integrated silicon, such as the AWS Trainium3. AMD’s MI400 series is also designed to challenge the Rubin architecture, particularly in memory-intensive tasks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe that the recent earnings have cemented why NVIDIA is the most valuable company on earth, considering that it is the indispensable gatekeeper of the AI revolution. It is now building the technical blueprint of intelligence, and with its annual cadence, the Vera Rubin platform is set to heavily capitalize on the shift from training to inference, which is where the real economic value of AI will be captured. I keep my Strong Buy rating on NVIDIA.</p>",

Its flagship candidate is Cadisegliatin (TTP399), an oral glucokinase activator being<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> developed as an adjunct to insulin in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and, through a regional collaboration, in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Topline results for the Phase 3 CATT1 trial are expected in 2H2026.

September 2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a quick overview, VTVT’s pipeline includes the candidate <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06334133\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cadisegliatin</a> (TTP399), which is a GK activator. This candidate is being studied in Phase 3 for the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), adjunctive to insulin. Cadisegliatin has a Breakthrough Therapy designation in T1D, yet despite this, VTVT as a whole seems relatively undercovered, so I thought it was worthwhile taking a look at it. After all, VTVT wholly owns Cadisegliatin for this particular indication, which targets a sizable <a href=\"https://www.globalgrowthinsights.com/market-reports/type-1-diabetes-t1d-market-104075\" rel=\"nofollow\">$4.4 billion</a> TAM (by 2035) in type 1 diabetes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Moreover, Cadisegliatin also presented positive results from the <a href=\"https://ir.vtvtherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vtv-therapeutics-announces-positive-topline-results-part-1-phase/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Simplici-T1</a> Phase 2 study, with statistically significant HbA1c improvement and a reduction in severe hypoglycemia events. Additionally, the candidate presented a favorable safety profile. The FDA draft guidance in 2023 recognized hypoglycemia endpoints as a clinically relevant efficacy outcome in diabetes trials, an outcome that was already reported in the Phase 2 trial. Before this, diabetes drug development was centered on the benefits through the improvement of hemoglobin A1C.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130169024_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1437\" data-height=\"540\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130169024_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Global Growth Insights.\" width=\"640\" height=\"241\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130169024_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130169024_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130169024_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130169024_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Global Growth Insights.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cadisegliatin is also being studied for Type 2 Diabetes (<a href=\"https://ir.vtvtherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vtv-therapeutics-and-m42s-iros-announce-submission-phase-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">T2D</a>) in Phase 2. This drug is researched for T2D in collaboration with G42 Healthcare, with a Phase 2 trial in insulin-using T2D patients in the Middle East, Africa, and Central Asia. The protocol submission for this trial was made in December 2025, planning that the first patient's first visit would be expected in Q1 2026.

This is a RAGE antagonist, which is studied in Phase 2 for the treatment of glioblastoma, pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer. Another indication is pneumonia, studied in Phase 2/3. Azeliragon is developed globally in partnership with Cantex.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Nevertheless, as I previously noted, I think Cadisegliatin is probably VTVT’s main value driver in the long run. In that sense, it’s worth mentioning that VTVT previously had issues with an unresolved finding in Cadisegliatin’s Phase 2 data. In fact, this setback prompted the FDA to place a hold on VTVT’s Cadisegliatin program. Fortunately, this incident was <a href=\"https://ir.vtvtherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/vtv-therapeutics-announces-fda-has-lifted-clinical-hold/\" rel=\"nofollow\">resolved</a> when VTVT demonstrated that the finding was a misleading result produced by the testing method and not by the drug itself.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130210896_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"948\" data-height=\"535\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239130210896_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Corporate Presentation.

September 2025.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I believe this basically removed a major R&amp;D roadblock for VTVT because the FDA’s reason to place the hold was resolved. Since then, Cadisegliatin’s development of the candidate has returned to being VTVT’s top R&amp;D priority. The company also noted a protocol amendment shortening CATT1 from 12 months to 6 months, with no change to primary endpoints.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead, we should get Cadisegliatin’s topline results by 2H2026. Additionally, there is a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filing/31603272#VTVT-20250930_HTM_ic60bf641e18d443d8fee2fea1792d052_88\">food-effect study</a>. VTVT wants to gather data to see how the drug's effectiveness is affected by food changes. For this, they’ll use healthy volunteers who have taken the drug under the following study conditions: fasting versus fed, low-fat versus high-fat meal. And hopefully, this will be another positive data point that corroborates Cadisegliatin’s safety profile for a potential FDA submission down the road.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation And Risk Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, from a valuation perspective, VTVT currently trades at a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTVT\">$487.9 million</a> market cap. This makes it a microcap with a relatively low trading volume of only 24.1 thousand shares, which, at the current $39.00 PPS, implies a shallow trading liquidity of $0.9 million. Meaning even tiny buy/sell orders can push the stock price significantly, which is why you should anticipate VTVT will remain volatile in the near term. Still, their latest <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/filings/pdf/18900576\">Q3 2025</a> 10-Q report shows their balance sheet holds $98.5 million in cash and equivalents against $0.3 million in notes payable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772223913026539_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1495\" data-height=\"584\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772223913026539_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Seeking Alpha Charts.\" width=\"640\" height=\"250\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772223913026539_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772223913026539_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772223913026539_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-1772223913026539_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Seeking Alpha Charts.</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So, it’s a relatively liquid balance sheet, and its book value reached $70.5 million at the end of Q3. However, by February 2026, VTVT also received <a href=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/02/02/3230224/0/en/vTv-Therapeutics-Amends-License-Agreement-with-Newsoara-Biopharma-Co-Ltd-for-PDE4-inhibitor-HPP737.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">$20.0 million</a> related to their license agreement with Newsoara for a worldwide license on a novel PDE4 inhibitor. Therefore, VTVT’s “updated” cash balances are likely closer to $118.8 million if we include the recent licensing deal. That would also increase its book value proportionally by the same amount, to around $90.5 million, indicating a P/B of 5.4. For comparison, their <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTVT/valuation/metrics\">sector’s median</a> P/B is slightly cheaper at just 2.9, suggesting there’s likely some premium embedded in VTVT’s shares at these levels already.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Furthermore, I also calculate VTVT burned through $5.2 million during Q3 2025. Note that I got this figure by simply adding its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VTVT/cash-flow-statement\">quarterly cash flows</a> from operations and CAPEX. And this figure would suggest a cash runway of roughly 22.8 quarters, which is extremely healthy for a clinical biotech like VTVT. However, it’s worth mentioning that VTVT’s cash burn will likely ramp up in the coming quarters. After all, Cadisegliatin’s R&amp;D was halted, as I previously mentioned.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239129803114_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1215\" data-height=\"620\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/59327344-17722239129803114_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Source: Corporate Presentation.

It’s challenging to anticipate how badly this will hit their cash reserves, but management’s investor presentation explicitly says that their runway will last “<a href=\"https://ir.vtvtherapeutics.com/static-files/a7d5327e-a471-475b-b279-0b07d3c08bee\" rel=\"nofollow\">well past</a>” the CATT1 topline readout.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since we should get this Cadisegliatin data point by 2H2026, I believe it substantially derisks VTVT at these levels. Naturally, if VTVT’s trials produce disappointing clinical data, then the stock will likely tumble after announcing those results. This is relatively normal among biotechs, and VTVT should behave similarly. However, on the other hand, if VTVT’s CATT1 data shows the candidate is suitable for a potential FDA submission, then it could be a major catalyst for the stock.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion: Worth Speculating</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, VTVT’s investment thesis at this point is pretty simple. If the upcoming CATT1 topline data is positive, then the stock could very well go much higher. T1D is a huge TAM, and given VTVT’s relatively small market cap, I feel a successful drug in this indication could generate substantial revenues over time. Still, as with other biotech stocks, clinical trials aren’t guaranteed to succeed. And in the meantime, VTVT’s cash burn could rise to unsustainable levels in their search for evidence that could warrant an FDA approval. So, until VTVT can actually commercialize Cadisegliatin, it will remain inherently speculative, which is why you should keep your position sizing manageable for now.</p>",

The fund changed its name, ticker, underlying index, and strategy on 8/1/2022. In particular, the fund used to be currency-hedged, and it is not anymore. Therefore, data prior to August 2022 are irrelevant to assess the current strategy, and should not be used in backtests.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">DIVI has a portfolio of 413 stocks, a 30-day SEC yield of 3.19%, and an expense ratio of 0.09%. Distributions are paid quarterly. It is quite a large ETF, with $2.4 billion in assets and an average daily volume of $9.5 million. As described in the prospectus by <a href=\"#overview\">Franklin Templeton</a>, the underlying index “<em>includes a security selection and weighting process that aims to deliver a higher dividend yield than the Parent Index</em>.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The methodology uses an optimizer, taking into account some constraints, in particular weight limits for countries, sectors, constituents, and turnover. Despite targeting an enhanced aggregate dividend yield, the optimization under constraints may include stocks that don’t pay a dividend. The index is reconstituted quarterly, and the portfolio’s turnover rate was 26% in the most recent fiscal year. I will use as a benchmark the MSCI EAFE Index, represented by iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/EFA\" title=\"iShares MSCI EAFE ETF\">EFA</a>), which has a similar geographical and size universe.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Portfolio</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The fund is mostly invested in large- and mega-cap companies (91% of asset value). The geographical allocation is close to the benchmark’s, as plotted on the next chart, which includes countries weighting more than 2%. Although the heaviest region is Europe (60% of assets), Japan comes in first position (22.7%), followed by the U.K. (13.8%). Other countries are below 10%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/2496631-1772232232581536.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Country allocation\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"605\" height=\"282\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/2496631-1772232232581536.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/2496631-1772232232581536.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/27/2496631-1772232232581536.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Country allocation <span>(chart: author: data: Franklin Templeton, iShares.)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The portfolio has a focus on financials (28.9%) and significant exposure in industrials (15.6%).

Is it too late to invest? We don’t think so. With<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> valuations still attractive and earnings growth forecasts looking up, this could be the right time to give the developing world a closer look.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Earnings growth could be an important catalyst in 2026. When EM equities surged by nearly 33% last year, our research indicates that valuation expansion drove nearly half the increase.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That has since changed. Recent gains have been fueled largely by earnings upgrades—a trend we expect to continue. EM earnings are now projected to grow by 18% in 2026, according to consensus estimates, outpacing both the US and other developed markets (DM) (<em>Display</em>). In our view, this suggests a more sustainable foundation for future performance than multiple expansions.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Strong Earnings Could Support Emerging Market Returns</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>2026 Consensus EPS Growth (Percent)</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-17722679798882174_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1143\" data-height=\"535\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-17722679798882174_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Strong Earnings Could Support Emerging Market Returns\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"300\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-17722679798882174_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-17722679798882174_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-17722679798882174_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-17722679798882174_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Historical and current analyses do not guarantee future results.

For example, valuations in Brazil are more than 35% lower than the MSCI EM. The country appears to be at an important inflection point in its monetary policy cycle, with rates expected to come down from lofty levels. In Brazil and the rest of the developing world, underallocation by global funds is keeping a lid on valuations (<em>Display</em>). This suggests that renewed interest in EM hasn’t translated into substantial participation.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>EM Equities Have Traditionally Been Underowned</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>EM Equities as a Share of Global Assets Under Management (Percent)</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-17722659433982947_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1207\" data-height=\"525\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-17722659433982947_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EM Equities Have Traditionally Been Underowned\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"278\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-17722659433982947_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-17722659433982947_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-17722659433982947_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-17722659433982947_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Historical and current analyses do not guarantee future results.

Nonetheless, improving corporate fundamentals and corporate earnings growth could be signs that this isn’t just another short cycle rebound—especially given the structural trends creating new opportunities.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emerging Markets Offer a Back Door to AI</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">AI is a great example of a supportive theme that investors may not associate with EM equities. Investing in AI can sometimes feel like chasing the most crowded—and expensive—parts of the US market. But, in our view, some of the more durable earnings streams could come from supplying the infrastructure that enables AI. That’s where we foresee EM gaining a unique foothold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">EM companies provide many of the critical building blocks for AI infrastructure, including everything from semiconductor foundries and high-bandwidth memory to data center power and thermal management systems. These “backdoor AI” firms tend to be less speculative and more grounded in long investment cycles. Many of these firms also boast high barriers to entry.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regardless of size, many AI suppliers with operations in EM trade at a discount to their US peers. In contrast to the hyperscalers, which have gone on a spending spree, EM tech companies are less capital intensive than their DM counterparts (<em>Display</em>).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>EM Tech Companies Offers Potential Upside with Lower Capital Intensity</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em><em>Capex as a Percentage of Sales (Percent)</em></em></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-1772265923290493_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1195\" data-height=\"641\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-1772265923290493_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"EM Tech Companies Offers Potential Upside with Lower Capital Intensity\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"343\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-1772265923290493_origin.png?io=w640 640w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-1772265923290493_origin.png?io=w480 480w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-1772265923290493_origin.png?io=w320 320w,https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2026/2/28/55028208-1772265923290493_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 767px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1023px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Past and current analyses do not guarantee future results. Left display of January 7, 2026; right display as of September 30, 2025. <span>(Source: Bloomberg, company reports and AB)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For investors, AI enablers have important implications for market volatility. Recently, concerns about software disruptions, monetization of escalating capex intensity and a possible AI bubble have buffeted flagship US AI megacaps. At the same time, hardware and component suppliers in the developing world were largely spared.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Governance Reform: Turning Earnings into Shareholder Value</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But even the strongest companies need stable backdrops in which to operate. Fortunately, corporate governance across the developing world is undergoing a quiet revolution with profound implications for investors. A case in point is South Korea’s “value-up” initiative, which just marked its second anniversary. While Japan’s corporate governance transformation unfolded over a decade, South Korea is still at the beginning of its journey, leaving significant room for improvement and a narrowing of the long-standing “Korean discount.”</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">South Korean financials are at the forefront of corporate governance reforms, while the country’s conglomerates, including world-leading franchises in memory, autos and defense, are just starting their value-up journey. Efforts to improve shareholder value are afoot in other regions as well. China has encouraged state-owned enterprises to prioritize valuations and shareholder returns, signaling a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4827133-5-overlooked-themes-for-equity-investors-in-china\" rel=\"noopener\">shift toward more market-friendly practices</a>. As part of this initiative, record-high buybacks and dividends have driven shareholder returns.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Global Polarization Is Creating New Opportunities</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Emerging markets are no stranger to geopolitical risk. Trade tensions, policy uncertainty and currency volatility can all weigh on investor confidence. But polarization is reshaping global supply chains in ways that create new opportunities for EM companies. Many countries are rerouting trade, diversifying production and building new linkages—reflecting a world in which growth drivers are becoming less synchronized.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Energy is a good example. The surge in global demand for liquified natural gas (LNG) is creating more demand for LNG carriers, one of the most technically demanding categories in shipbuilding. Historically, Chinese and Korean shipyards have dominated this space, but shifting trade relationships are changing market share patterns. As US–China tensions have intensified, many western companies have become more cautious about placing orders with Chinese yards involved in sensitive energy routes. Korean shipbuilders, with a long track record of strong safety credentials and established relationships, have been clear beneficiaries of this shift—an example of how trade tensions can create new opportunities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because the developing world is so immense, we believe it’s best navigated through skilled active management. Active, bottom-up investors can tap into a wide range of attractive investment opportunities at compelling valuations. EM have seen fits and starts before, but we see a clear difference between past short-cycle rebounds and what’s transpiring now—an increasingly earnings-based recovery that could have plenty of room to run.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>The views expressed herein do not constitute research, investment advice or trade recommendations and do not necessarily represent the views of all AB portfolio-management teams.

We are swinging between the \"War Premium\" and<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> the \"Peace Pivot,\" and for the disciplined investor, volatility is where the real money is made. I’ve been calling this the </span><em class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Silver Peace Prize</strong></em><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> because IF the world celebrates a potential end to current conflicts, </span><strong class=\"paywall-full-content\">the market is about to hand us a once-in-a-generation entry point for silver, gold, and uranium miners.</strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Trump is finally closer to a deal in the Ukraine-Russia conflict, and Putin is at the table. We know the 47th President has his eyes on the Nobel Peace Prize, and that means a compromise with Iran is no longer a fringe theory; it’s a distinct possibility. Meanwhile, <strong>silver has spent the last year acting less like a metal and more like a high-beta fear gauge. It’s the VIX in physical form.</strong> If we get a handshake in Geneva or a breakthrough in the Middle East, the <em>safety trade</em> will unwind with the force of a hurricane.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">We’ve already seen the preview. When the \"Dmitriev Package\" leaked (you can read about it in my last article <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4876324-petrodollar-2-0-why-russias-dollar-pivot-could-crash-gold-and-silver\">here</a>), that massive proposal to bring Russia back into the dollar system and the lower fuel prices that would ensue, silver didn’t just dip; it cratered to $74. When Mark Carney reportedly walked out of those tense tariff negotiations with Canada, we saw it snap back to $80. This volatility is a masterclass in psychological warfare. But here is the secret: once the war fear is gone and the political risk premium has forced silver and gold down, the market will wake up to a cold, hard physical reality.<strong> Even in a peaceful world, there simply isn't enough silver</strong> to power the AI data centers, the global solar rollout, and the next-gen defense industry. Furthermore, America still has to pay for its ballooning debts, putting a floor under gold.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I’m looking for a <em>Peace Crash</em> to bring silver to the $65 to $68 range. There is strong historical support at $48. This should be the floor, $10 below the critical support where the bankers who are short finally get their cover and the smart money steps in. My limit orders are already set between $64 and $66.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I won’t be caught up in the noise or the panic IF the PEACE with Iran headlines hit. I’m waiting for the <em>Sale of the Century</em> to buy silver miners because I know who is waiting on the other side of the world. Chinese markets. If silver is sitting at $65 while the West is panicking about the price drop, the Chinese Central Bank and private hoarders will gobble up every available ounce. I plan to have my bids filled before they even log in.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In this scenario, <strong>my<em> Peace Price</em> buy list is ready</strong>. I’m looking at the high-beta juniors that get punished the most during these macro shocks. When silver drops 20%, these juniors can drop 40% or more on pure emotion. That is where you find the life-changing upside. I’m focusing on the <em>American Soil</em> plays and the high-grade Canadian explorers. IF the <em>Peace Prize</em> drama plays out, don't lose sight of the uranium and gold sectors; they will also fall, giving us the unique opportunity to buy and hold at lower prices.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>If the Iran talks fail, gold will snap back toward $5,500 very quickly.</strong> And if the Strait of Hormuz sees even a whisper of a blockade, oil and uranium will go through the roof. Iran’s primary leverage is its enrichment capability. If war starts, those facilities are the first targets, creating a<em> Nuclear Catalyst</em> that removes any hope of Iranian supply and forces global panic buying of yellowcake. In contrast, a future deal with Russia brings massive uranium back on line.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The silver markets are currently in a tug-of-war between <em>scary news</em> and <em>hopeful news</em>, which is causing wild swings in the metal. If the US goes to war with Iran and silver tests much higher highs, I will take profits when silver hits $130 to $180, as I will also do on my uranium portfolio due to the unprecedented possibility of the deflation of the de-dollar trade as Putin negotiates selling oil to Europe in dollars again.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But even if we get Putin’s \"Grand Bargain,\" AND a peace deal with Iran, I remain fundamentally, unshakably bullish on the metals for the long term.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Here is why the Silver Bull isn't over:</h2> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p><strong>The Physical Deficit:</strong> We are in a structural shortage that no Peace Treaty can fix. The world is using more silver than it mines for the sixth year in a row. In a war with Iran, industrial demand for silver (defense systems, electronics) spikes just as investors try to buy every physical ounce.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Debt Disaster:</strong> U.S. debt-to-GDP is exploding. Neither party has the political will for austerity, and the <em>hidden tax</em> inflation is the only way out.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The AI &amp; Solar Hunger:</strong> AI hardware and high-voltage data centers are silver-hungry. You can't run the future on paper dollars; you need the physical conductivity of silver and uranium to fuel it.</p></li> <li><p><strong>BRICS and the Great Divorce:</strong> Even if Putin uses the dollar for a few years to stabilize his economy and the dollar, the move toward commodity-backed trade isn't stopping. China and Russia aren't going to stop gobbling up gold, silver, and uranium.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Credit Crunch:</strong> We are looking at a shaky year as commercial real estate loans come due and regional banks are forced to mark-to-market and tech stocks come back down to earth. When the credit freeze happens, people will run back to the only assets with no counterparty risk.</p></li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The <em>Dollar Strength</em> we will see from a Putin deal will be a headwind to the metals, not just a temporary political phenomenon. Yet, the scarcity of these metals is a permanent physical reality. I’m keeping my cash ready for the <em>Peace Floor</em> so I can buy the best silver miners in the world at a huge discount.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To play this <em>Snap-Back</em>, I am focusing on the<em> Quality Tier</em> of the market, the companies that have shown the most resilience and have the highest probability of leading the charge back as silver rebounds to $125 and beyond.</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li><p><strong>Wheaton Precious Metals (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/WPM\" title=\"Wheaton Precious Metals Corp.\">WPM</a>):</strong> This has been the absolute standout of the year. While other miners have felt the sting of the recent crashes, Wheaton has held its ground. They have the cleanest exposure to silver prices without the mining inflation. They are the smart money bunker.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Hecla Mining (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/HL\" title=\"Hecla Mining Company\">HL</a>):</strong> The largest producer in the U.S. Hecla. It's the poster child for American mineral independence. They have the margins to survive a dip to $60 but will explode when the war fear is replaced by industrial scarcity.</p></li> <li><p><strong>First Majestic Silver (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AG\" title=\"First Majestic Silver Corp.\">AG</a>):</strong> Shorted and volatile, this is the ultimate short squeeze candidate when the pivot happens. They will snap back very quickly.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Silvercorp Metals (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SVM\" title=\"Silvercorp Metals Inc.\">SVM</a>):</strong> They have consistently managed to keep costs low through the chaos. It’s a solid, high-yield play for those who want to hold through the macro shocks.</p></li> </ul> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>Action I will be taking if war is declared on Iran</strong></h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The structural fracturing (<a href=\"https://www.investing.com/analysis/silvers-great-divorce-of-2026-why-the-100-breakout-is-just-the-beginning-200673833\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Great Divorce</a>) of the physical from the paper silver market is no longer a theory; with silver at $94 and the COMEX vaults compromised, <strong>we are witnessing a generational physical squeeze</strong>. According to<a href=\"https://www.livemint.com/market/commodities/silver-inventory-on-comex-falls-below-90-million-ounces-what-does-this-mean-for-investors-11771836981544.html\" rel=\"noopener\"> this week’s market analysis of official CME data</a>, registered silver inventories have plummeted below the critical 90 million ounce mark, while open interest exceeds available stock by over 400%. We are now in force majeure territory. If I see news that the COMEX has officially suspended trading or has moved to Cash Settlement Only, it will signal the final decoupling where the paper price fails and the value of physical metal and high-grade miners goes viral. I will be getting ready to sell quickly in the peak of the panic as this and war news sends the metals parabolic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><strong>My exit strategy is clear:</strong> I am holding my miners for the $130–$180 War Peak and will be harvesting gains as the mining equities inevitably catch up several days after the spot price surges as news of war breaks out. If silver hits $130, the liquidity vacuum will force the miners up vertically in a matter of hours. The physical reality of a 6-year deficit may finally break the paper manipulation. At the same time, a physical delivery crisis collides with a wartime supply deficit. <strong>The perfect storm will send gold and silver, the safe haven physical VIX parabolic.</strong></p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Historically, once a commodity breaks its all-time high (the $122 level we hit in January), it enters Price Discovery. The first day silver gaps to $120, I expect the miners will be lagging. The move from $122 to $140 and beyond will be driven by FOMO and panic buying from short-sellers who are being liquidated. I will wait for the third day of the vertical move when the retail FOMO hits and people buy the miners because they can't find physical silver. I will also sell my uranium portfolio on the war premium due to the unprecedented possibility of the hit of future deflation of the de-dollar trade as Putin works with Trump to sell oil in US dollars again, propping up the greenback and pushing us unexpectedly towards petrodollar 2.0.</p>",
