(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOGI\" title=\"Logitech International S.A.\">LOGI</a></span>) is a designer and manufacturer of consumer computer hardware, including keyboards, mice, microphones, cameras, and other computer peripherals. The Swiss company was founded in 1981 and has around 7,300 employees with a market capitalization<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> of around $11.4 billion. This puts it in the top 15 companies in technology hardware and peripherals. This part of information technology can often be forgotten, as software and AI-related companies get the most attention. Most importantly, the stock is in the consumer discretionary category, which suggests it may be more sensitive to the cyclicality of the economy.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revisiting November 2024 Analysis</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Since my last <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4739480-logitech-margin-expansion-offers-valuation-opportunity\">analysis</a> was published about a year ago, LOGI bounced from trading down -9.4% in the year through November 2024 to increasing over 50% through the end of October 2025. In that piece, I highlighted Logitech’s improving profitability and operational discipline as signs that the market was undervaluing the company’s long-term potential. The core message was that margin expansion, product innovation, and growing exposure to the education market were reshaping its fundamentals even as headline revenue growth remained uneven. Here are the key points from that analysis:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Profitability had become Logitech’s defining strength, with gross margins rising to around 43.6% (the highest since early 2021) as cost reductions and a better product mix drove consistent improvement. The company achieved five straight quarters of margin gains, signaling durable progress in its pricing power and expense control.</li> <li>The company’s innovation, particularly in gaming and creative peripherals, showcased its ability to differentiate in both mature and emerging markets. These launches helped reinforce LOGI’s reputation as a premium brand rather than a low-cost manufacturer. Additionally, rapid growth in tablet accessories tied to schools and digital learning highlighted the success of LOGI’s move into the education sector. Management viewed this vertical expansion as a model for extending the brand into other specialized markets.</li> <li>China remained both a challenge and an opportunity, as demand softness and competition weighed on short-term results while local product strategies and supply chain diversification laid the groundwork for recovery. LOGI’s measured approach balanced near-term caution with long-term positioning in a critical market.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The primary motivation behind my buy recommendation a year ago was a favorable valuation after the stock had dropped in the month and year before. Despite the clear fundamental improvement, the stock traded with a P/E ratio around 17-18x, below its five-year average of 22x. That mismatch between fundamentals and valuation made it clear that LOGI had significant upside. As mentioned before, LOGI has seen a strong run in the past year, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SP500\" title=\"S&amp;P 500 Index\">SP500</a>) with gains of just over 45%. That demands a reassessment of the value proposition and, potentially, an update to the rating.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FYQ2 2026 Earnings</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">LOGI recently <a href=\"https://s1.q4cdn.com/104539020/files/doc_financials/2026/q2/Logitech-Q2-FY26-Press-Release_vF.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">released</a> its FYQ2 2026 earnings, which cover its results for Q3 2025. The stock continued its run of earnings beats, reporting non-GAAP EPS of $1.45, a healthy beat over Wall Street expectations of $1.23. Its revenue numbers are typically a bit closer to consensus, and in FYQ2 2026, LOGI met expectations with revenue of $1.19 billion.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Importantly, its growth rates of revenue and profits were both positive. Total revenue increased 6% YoY in U.S. dollar terms and 4% YoY in constant currency terms, the strongest increase so far this calendar year, with five business segments expanding and three business segments declining. The sales growth helped contribute to an increase of 19% YoY in operating income, also the strongest so far this calendar year.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sales Growth</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1047\" data-height=\"786\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Regional and product sales growth analysis\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619171931339068_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>LOGI FYQ2 earnings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Regional <a href=\"https://s1.q4cdn.com/104539020/files/doc_financials/2026/q1/Logitech-Q1-2026-Shareholder-Letter_vF.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">performance</a> was mixed, with strong international gains offsetting softness in the Americas. Sales in the Americas declined -4% YoY in constant currency, weighed down by weakness in Gaming and Tablet Accessories, though Pointing Devices saw healthy growth. EMEA delivered a 3% YoY increase, supported by solid demand across segments. The clear standout was Asia Pacific, where sales rose 19% YoY, marking a second consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Strength was broad-based in this region as well, highlighting improving sell-through momentum and successful new product uptake in the region. In fact, the overall increase in sell-through relative to net sales growth (10% YoY vs. 6% YoY) points to stable consumer demand despite weakness in LOGI’s main region. Across product lines, growth was led by Logitech’s core Personal Workspace and Gaming segments, picking up the slack in some smaller segments:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>Gaming revenue grew 5% YoY in constant currency, driven by PC Gaming and strong Asia-Pacific results. Notably, demand in the Americas was softer due to market weakness and pricing adjustments related to tariffs. Despite that, LOGI announced 12 new products in this segment, showing its commitment to innovation in the face of uncertainty.</li> <li>Within its Personal Workspace product group, Keyboards &amp; Combos and Pointing Devices both posted 10% YoY growth (constant currency), supported by double-digit expansion in EMEA and Asia Pacific and the launch of new premium models. LOGI continues to maintain its top position in these markets, which is key in uncertain times.</li> <li>Beyond Gaming and Personal Workspace, smaller segments struggled. Video Collaboration grew 3% YoY, with premium products lifting average selling prices, while Webcams rose 2% YoY, maintaining market leadership despite a modest decline in Asia Pacific. Tablet Accessories slipped -3% YoY after a strong prior-year comparison, and Headsets fell -8% YoY due to transitioned product lines.</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, the mix of gains in core categories and strong international growth reinforced the company’s leadership in premium peripherals. LOGI has consistently shown that its diversification across the computer peripheral market is its strength. For example, management noted in the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834351-logitech-international-s-a-logi-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript\">conference call</a> that its B2B segments performed well while consumer segments were a bit soft, and similarly, the growth in Asia Pacific picked up some of the slack of the North American markets. I believe this has been key to its consistency in earnings results over the last few years.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Profitability</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1044\" data-height=\"389\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Non-GAAP operating expenses FYQ2 earnings\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"238\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-1761917639728845_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>LOGI FYQ2 earnings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While it’s always good to see solid top-line growth, the storyline for 2025 has been about profit margins. Tariffs have created a challenging environment for managing costs and compressed margins in the first two quarters of the year, and that has called into question one of my main motivations for rating the stock as a Buy. However, results in FYQ2 2026 earnings have shown LOGI’s resilience. Non-GAAP gross margins were down -30 bps YoY to 43.8% in FYQ2 as tariff costs weighed, but this was a significant improvement of 170 bps over gross margins of 42.1% in FYQ1 (which were down -120 bps YoY). Further down towards the bottom line, non-GAAP operating margins were reported to have increased 210 bps YoY to 19.4% in FYQ2 (up 180 bps QoQ), an even more impressive showing of operational efficiency. Management highlighted two key reasons for the preservation of its margins:</p> <ul class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <li>LOGI focused on cutting costs where they could control them, specifically in SG&amp;A and marketing expenses, such that operating expenses actually declined -3% YoY to be about 24.4% of total sales, a drop of -240 bps from the same quarter a year ago. This was part of a successful plan put in place by management to offset the impact of the tariffs.</li> <li>Another way LOGI sought to find relief from tariffs was by diversifying its supply chains. Management reported that it was continuing to find ways to source a few North American goods from China and was “on track to reduce our share of U.S. products originating from China to 10% by the end of this calendar year.”</li> </ul> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b990dbe362f826de17ed2bd9b22b5ed4.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b990dbe362f826de17ed2bd9b22b5ed4.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b990dbe362f826de17ed2bd9b22b5ed4.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b990dbe362f826de17ed2bd9b22b5ed4.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b990dbe362f826de17ed2bd9b22b5ed4.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b990dbe362f826de17ed2bd9b22b5ed4.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b990dbe362f826de17ed2bd9b22b5ed4.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b990dbe362f826de17ed2bd9b22b5ed4.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_b990dbe362f826de17ed2bd9b22b5ed4.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I continue to be impressed by LOGI's ability to convert healthy sales growth into strong profitability, while maintaining a reputation for developing premium products for consumer and business customers (releasing 16 new products in the last quarter). Wall Street seems to consistently underappreciate this facet of LOGI’s fundamentals, which is why we see earnings beats consistently, even while revenues are estimated pretty well by analysts. It does appear that the worst of the volatility in U.S. trade policy is likely behind us, and tariff rates have more or less reached their ceilings. With that in mind, further gross margin compression is likely to become less of an issue.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"796\" data-height=\"327\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"FYQ3 2025 outlook\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"263\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619172723127685_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>LOGI FYQ2 earnings</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">FYQ2 2026 earnings ended with an outlook for the final quarter of 2025, the most important quarter for LOGI since it includes the holiday season. The outlook sees sales growth similar to what was seen in FYQ2 and an increase of about 5.2% YoY in operating income. Management’s feelings about the upcoming quarter can be described as cautiously optimistic. CFO Matteo Anversa summarized the sentiment well in his comments about the outlook.</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>We believe we will see continued strong momentum in our business, but we also see some market uncertainty. The North American consumer market, especially in gaming, was softer in Q2... We're cautiously optimistic that this will improve for the holiday season, but that is, of course, yet to be confirmed.</p></blockquote> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Holiday Season Uncertainty</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Yes, the holiday season is the biggest question mark for LOGI, especially in its largest North American segment. That segment already saw sales decline in FYQ2, and the macroeconomic fundamentals, especially in the US, suggest that we will likely see a similar trend in FYQ3. In my previous analysis, I highlighted how LOGI would likely see a strong holiday quarter due to healthy consumer fundamentals, especially among younger demographics that are more likely to spend on electronics. But that tailwind has quickly flipped into a headwind due to the deterioration of the labor market in 2025, especially for LOGI’s key younger demographic.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"750\" data-height=\"474\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Younger demographics employment growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"404\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619176810123303_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Vanguard</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In the U.S., we have seen nonfarm employment growth slow down significantly, even seeing a month of job losses in June. The slowdown in hiring has been felt across the labor market, but it has particularly impacted younger populations. <a href=\"https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/data-show-labor-market-strength-despite-slower-hiring.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Research</a> from Vanguard shows that employment growth has indeed slowed in the 26-40 and 41-55 age groups, but the deceleration has been the sharpest in the 21-25 age group, falling from a peak of 5.7% in 2022 to just as of September 2025. This decline in employment growth translates to a decline in income growth, and Vanguard has tracked this trend in its own analysis (from 401(k) contribution data).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another <a href=\"https://www.ncci.com/SecureDocuments/QEB/QEB-Q3-2025.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">analysis</a> from NCCI about unemployment rates reports a more troubling result:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"><p>“In August, the unemployment rate for younger workers reached 10.5%, compared to an unemployment rate of just 3.6% for prime age workers (25–54 years old).”</p></blockquote> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The data on both hiring and joblessness are pretty consistent in pointing out that younger consumers are having more trouble in the labor market.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As a result of this trend, I believe that FYQ3 2026 (and beyond) will be difficult for LOGI, and the softness in North American demand will weigh on its headline sales growth. This ties back into the simple fact that the company is a member of the consumer discretionary sector, which makes it sensitive to these moments in the business cycle. This is especially the case in a quarter that relies heavily on demand from the holiday season.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">China Is Still Critical</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While North America remains the main source of weakness, strength in the Asia Pacific, and especially in China, has become a key offset. The “China for China” strategy continues to deliver, with double-digit regional growth driven by strong local demand and a steady cadence of new product launches.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">China has been the standout, leading global gaming sales thanks to the success of local products and more targeted, high-ROI marketing campaigns. Management also noted that China’s performance was ahead of the broader Asia Pacific region, which already grew 19% YoY in FYQ2. These results show that LOGI’s localized strategy and strong brand presence in China are paying off, and continued momentum in Asia Pacific could help cushion the impact of softer US demand heading into the next few quarters.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure a-c paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"775\" data-height=\"468\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"China annual retail sales growth\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"386\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/47232146-17619177439129403_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>China NBS</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Although, the Chinese economy is feeling the effects of the U.S. tariff policy, creating a tougher macro environment for LOGI. Retail sales growth has slowed from a near-term peak of 6.5% YoY in May 2025 to just 3.0% YoY in September 2025, the weakest since November 2024. This is likely based in weaker income growth so far this year, as <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/cn/our-insights/our-insights/chinese-consumption-amid-the-new-reality?utm_source=chatgpt.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">estimated</a> by McKinsey. An analysis completed in Q2 2025 suggested that household income growth would only be about 1.4% in 2025, down from 2.5% YoY, and while that didn’t necessarily translate to weaker expected consumption, LOGI’s products being more discretionary suggests it is likely to see more of a headwind in weaker income growth. Nevertheless, LOGI’s management has more visibility into its own Chinese markets, and its market positioning might shield it from broader macro weakness.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revisiting The Value Proposition</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"sa-widget sa-ycharts paywall-full-content\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_81ece75ddd41dfd6c42bf96f6b500e46.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart\" width=\"635\" height=\"366\" class=\"sa-ycharts-img\" data-width=\"635\" data-height=\"366\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_81ece75ddd41dfd6c42bf96f6b500e46.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_81ece75ddd41dfd6c42bf96f6b500e46.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_81ece75ddd41dfd6c42bf96f6b500e46.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_81ece75ddd41dfd6c42bf96f6b500e46.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_81ece75ddd41dfd6c42bf96f6b500e46.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_81ece75ddd41dfd6c42bf96f6b500e46.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_81ece75ddd41dfd6c42bf96f6b500e46.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_81ece75ddd41dfd6c42bf96f6b500e46.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"><figcaption>Data by YCharts</figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With LOGI running up over 45% in the last year and FYQ2 operating income reported up around 19% YoY, there has been a significant increase in its valuation over that time period. The market has (rightfully) readjusted its pricing of sales up from 2.8x about a year ago to 3.9x today and its pricing of earnings up from 17.7x a year ago to around 27.4x today. Comparatively, this puts its P/S ratio at the highest levels since 2021, and its P/E ratio at the highest since early 2024 (still below the peak valuations in late 2023).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Importantly, these valuation changes haven’t come about from weaker fundamentals, but rather from the market adjusting (appropriately) to LOGI’s consistently better-than-expected margin results. Unfortunately, this makes the stock much less of a value opportunity, and Seeking Alpha’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOGI/ratings/quant-ratings\">Quant ratings</a> reflect that, as the valuation grade has moved from B- six months ago to a D- now (though the P/E ratio comparison is still rated a B).</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After its latest earnings, LOGI is now trading above $120, the highest since the stock peaked above $130 during the COVID lockdown period. I like this company’s fundamentals, as it showcases why strong and consistent margins are an important factor that can lead to outperforming the broader market. However, because the valuations have increased and macro conditions have started to become unfavorable in its key North American market (especially for its key upcoming FYQ3 quarter), I am downgrading my LOGI rating from a Buy to a Hold.</p>",

This week, I bring extremely interesting information about the perception of buying when an asset returns to its historical average. I say this because a major objection for investors when purchasing assets that replicate the main American indexes is waiting for an eventual return to the average.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Unfortunately, research over the last 225 years (since 1800) shows that one sector can dominate the market for up to 50 years. Therefore, you should not wait for technology and artificial intelligence stocks to return to their historical average, as they may take a long time to correct. Additionally, when the price of these shares returns to its historical average, it is probably no longer the best time to invest.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59387725-17618543049020112.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Sectors can stay the largest without reversion for half centuries\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"550\" height=\"382\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59387725-17618543049020112.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59387725-17618543049020112.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59387725-17618543049020112.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59387725-17618543049020112.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59387725-17618543049020112.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59387725-17618543049020112.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59387725-17618543049020112.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/59387725-17618543049020112.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Sectors can stay the largest without reversion for half centuries (Goldman Sachs, ETF Shares.

But the relative reliability for projecting performance with fixed-income securities is closely linked to<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> buying and holding a bond through its maturity date. Results over shorter periods can and often do vary substantially. Investing in bond funds introduces more return variability vs. the implied outlook with a relevant buy-and-hold position in an individual Treasury security or corporate bond.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A high degree of clarity for expected return with bonds is a function of using the current yield at the time of purchase as a forecast. For example, a 5-year Treasury Note is currently trading around 3.7%. Assuming you purchase the security directly at that current yield and hold it through maturity, the performance will roughly match the yield at the time of purchase. (Technically, yield-to-maturity, which factors in additional variables, is a more accurate measure for projecting return, but for simplicity in this illustration, let’s assume current yield is equivalent. Note, too, that we’re ignoring such issues as how you invest a bond’s payouts through time and other variables, such as callable bonds and defaults that affect returns for corporates.)</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investing in bonds by way of a fund adds another layer of complication that can, and usually does, affect performance - sometimes in ways that aren’t intuitive. As an example, consider a buy-and-hold investment in Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VBMFX\" title=\"Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund Investor Shares\">VBMFX</a>), a popular mutual fund that holds investment-grade securities.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Morningstar reports that a bit more than half of VBMFX’s portfolio is held in US government bonds, with corporates (25%) and securitized bonds making up most of the rest (22%). The fund’s yield to maturity is 4.38%.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Assume the 5-year Treasury yield is a proxy for the fund, which implies that when you bought VBMFX, the current 5-year rate is a reasonable first approximation of what you can expect to earn over the next 5 years. The broader portfolio holdings in VBMFX will create differences vs. a 5-year Note, but current yield for the government security should be a decent back-of-the-envelope forecast.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Sometimes that’s a reasonable assumption, but it can also be wide of the mark. Much depends on current macro conditions and the outlook when you buy VBMFX.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For context, the chart below compares the 5-year annualized total return for VBMFX five years hence relative to the 5-year yield. If the 5-year yield was a perfect forecast for VBMFX’s return five years down the road, the two lines would match exactly. Clearly, that’s not the case. Although there are periods when the 5-year yield (red line in chart) is a reasonably accurate estimate of the future 5-year return for VBMFX (black line), there can be substantial divergences for prolonged periods.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_322a798d23fd71081330249b14cd5a04.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Chart showing 5-year US Treasury yield versus subsequent 5-year return for VBMFX\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_322a798d23fd71081330249b14cd5a04.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_322a798d23fd71081330249b14cd5a04.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_322a798d23fd71081330249b14cd5a04.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_322a798d23fd71081330249b14cd5a04.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_322a798d23fd71081330249b14cd5a04.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_322a798d23fd71081330249b14cd5a04.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_322a798d23fd71081330249b14cd5a04.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/saupload_322a798d23fd71081330249b14cd5a04.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For most of VBMFX’s history, the fund has outperformed or matched the 5-year yield. But since the Federal Reserve’s latest round of rate hikes starting in 2022, VBMFX’s five-year return has trailed the 5-year yield (from five years earlier) by a relatively wide margin for an extended period.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There are several possible reasons for the mismatch in recent years, including the rapid pace of 2022-2023 rate hikes, the lingering effects of the pandemic on the economy, and the sharp spike in inflation in 2022-2023.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another relevant factor: the four-decade trend of generally declining interest rates that ended in 2021. Forty years of falling yields bred a high degree of comfort in assuming that risk was minimal for the bond market’s outlook. When that regime ended, the shift introduced more uncertainty and volatility into the market to a degree unseen in decades.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even before 2021, it was unsurprising that VBMFX’s rolling 5-year return deviated from the implied forecast via a 5-year yield. The fund, although it tracks an index, holds a range of bonds and therefore takes more risk vs. a Treasury note. The higher risk mostly paid off, until the 2022 rate hikes.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The larger point is that developing return and risk expectations for bond funds has become considerably more nuanced. By contrast, forecasting VBMFX and other bond strategies was more or less pro forma in the pre-2021 era, with relatively low stakes given the general slide in yields.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That era ended in 2022, and it’s debatable when or if it will return. Between tariffs, gridlock in government, elevated fiscal risk for the US government, and the potential for AI-fueled economic disruption, a repeat performance of the secular slide in interest rates during 1981-2021 looks unlikely, at least at the moment.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In turn, the stakes are higher for crunching the numbers and reading the trends for developing expectations for bond funds.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Buying and holding a Treasury note, by comparison, still offers simplicity and relative reliability for projecting future performance.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><em>Original Source: <a href=\"https://themilwaukeecompany.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Milwaukee Company</a></em> </p>",

The used car retailer, which some like myself thought could go bankrupt just a few years ago, has been one of the best-performing stocks in recent years. On Wednesday, the company announced its <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285155-carvana-announces-record-third-quarter-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/pr/20285155-carvana-announces-record-third-quarter-2025-results#hasComeFromMpArticle=false\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">third-quarter results</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\">, and while the stock dropped afterwards, there were certainly many things to like.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Previous </strong>Coverage Of The Name</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It's been about two and a half years since I last covered Carvana, at which point <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4601598-carvana-stock-closer-to-the-brink\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4601598-carvana-stock-closer-to-the-brink\" target=\"_blank\">I remained a major skeptic</a>. At that time, revenues were falling as the company was pulling back on inventory to stem major cash burn, and the balance sheet was in terrible shape. With a so-so margin picture and not much room to grow in the near term, the once booming stock traded for just around $11 a share. With things improving significantly since, this has been one of the market's biggest rallies, up over 2,700%, compared to a 65% gain for the S&amp;P 500.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>A </strong>Look At The Q3 Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the September ending period, Carvana announced retail units sold of 156,000, or more than 44% growth over the prior year period. With some help from average selling prices, the company reported record quarterly revenue of $5.65 billion. This number was up 55% year over year, and it crushed street estimates by more than $550 million. Total revenues have more than doubled from where they were just two years earlier. Thanks to <span>seven</span> straight quarterly revenue beats and management's hope to get to 3 million annual deliveries within 5 to 10 years, analyst revenue estimates <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVNA/earnings/revisions\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVNA/earnings/revisions\" target=\"_blank\">for future years have soared</a>, as seen in the table below.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618344475287867.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Revenue Estimates\" width=\"432\" height=\"161\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"432\" data-height=\"161\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618344475287867.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618344475287867.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618344475287867.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618344475287867.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618344475287867.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618344475287867.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618344475287867.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618344475287867.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Carvana Revenue Estimates <span>(Seeking Alpha)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The biggest key to the ongoing turnaround has been major cost management. As the company has worked to integrate the ADESA sites it acquired over time, along with reducing operating expenses per unit, overall margins have improved tremendously. In Q3 2022, for instance, gross margins were 10.6%, and operating margins were negative 15%. In the just reported quarter, however, those numbers had jumped to 20.3% and a positive 9.8%, respectively. On the operating side, that's more than <span>$1</span> billion of improvement. Even with gross margins down 175 basis points year over year, management was still able to drive a 55-basis-point increase for its operating margins.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As revenues continue to grow over time, the bottom line could look even better. While the gross margin percentage may not rise every single quarter, gross margin dollars should benefit from the top-line increase. It also appears that as the company continues to sell more vehicles, it may be able to reduce operating expenses as a percentage of revenue another percentage point or two. Finally, interest expenses were still running at a half<span>-</span>billion-dollar pace in Q3 2025, and annual positive cash flow moving forward will help to bring those payments down further from the nearly $700 million run rate peak they were at in early 2024.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Major </strong>Balance Sheet Improvement</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My biggest concern back in the day was the company's balance sheet. With the company losing money for a time, and also spending wildly to grow, cash burn was extremely high. Just two and a half years ago, net debt was nearly $8 billion, and there was a lot of talk about a potential bankruptcy. Carvana <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/19/carvana-deal-to-reduce-debt-shares-soar.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/19/carvana-deal-to-reduce-debt-shares-soar.html\" target=\"_blank\">struck a major debt deal</a> with lenders, and since then, the situation has improved tremendously, as seen in the chart below.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"866\" data-height=\"480\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Net Debt\" width=\"640\" height=\"355\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"355\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-17618349503585184_origin.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Carvana Net Debt <span>(Company Filings)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">At the end of September, the net debt figure was down to just around $3 billion. Total cash was more than $2.1 billion, while total debt stood at just over $5.2 billion. The company has diluted investors a bit over the years to help with its debt pile, but it shouldn't need any substantial equity raises moving forward unless it is for a major acquisition. With the surge in shares in recent years, even a couple of percent of dilution now would wipe out a significant amount of the company's remaining debt.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Free cash flow in the first 9 months of the year was just over half a billion dollars. While that was down from nearly $800 million in the first <span>three</span> quarters of last year, it was mainly due to an extra $522 million spent on inventory. Positive cash flow will allow for more debt repurchases, and as mentioned <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835180-carvana-co-cvna-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835180-carvana-co-cvna-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">on the conference call</a>, another nearly $100 million worth of notes were bought back in October.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Valuation </strong>Is High, But It Has Certainly Come Down</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With Thursday's more than 13.8% drop, Carvana currently has a market cap of about $66.5 billion. Based on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVNA/earnings/estimates\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVNA/earnings/estimates\" target=\"_blank\">current revenue estimates</a>, that means the stock trades for about 2.67 times next year's projected revenue. That is a major premium to names like CarMax (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KMX\" title=\"CarMax, Inc.\">KMX</a>) and AutoNation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AN\" title=\"AutoNation, Inc.\">AN</a>), who both go for about 0.25 times their projected 2026 sales. However, those two names are projected for very limited revenue growth, while Carvana is seeing its top line soar.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With shares of Carvana about $100 off their 52-week high, and revenue estimates jumping as shown above, that valuation has certainly improved. The stock was going for well over 4 times next year's expected sales just a few months ago. As pointed out in the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1690820/000169082025000352/ex99_1q32025.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1690820/000169082025000352/ex99_1q32025.htm\" target=\"_blank\">company's shareholder letter</a>, growth currently dwarfs the industry (44% unit growth in Q3 vs. 0% average), and margins are considerably higher (11.3% Adjusted EBITDA vs. 5.0% average).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Wall Street analysts are also very positive on the name currently. As of Thursday morning, 14 of the 22 analysts covering the name had either a <span>\"B</span>uy\" or <span>\"S</span>trong Buy\" recommendation on the stock, with just <span>one</span> \"Strong Sell,\" and seven holds. The <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVNA/ratings/sell-side-ratings\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CVNA/ratings/sell-side-ratings\" target=\"_blank\">average price target</a> as of Thursday night was just about $424, implying nearly 39% upside from current levels.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <strong>Final </strong>Thoughts And Recommendation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While Carvana shares tumbled on Thursday, the company's Q3 report showed just how much of a turnaround has been completed here. No longer is the company losing money and burning through large amounts of cash. Revenue growth is soaring with decent margins, and positive cash flow has helped to significantly improve what was once a hideous balance sheet.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With the company having just 1.5% market share currently, there is plenty of room for future growth, especially given a lack of meaningful presence in some areas of the country, seen below. Just a doubling of market share would put the company over a million retail units sold a year, and management hopes to get well beyond that in the next decade.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-1761836416667238.jpg?io=w640\" alt=\"Coverage Map\" width=\"606\" height=\"371\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"606\" data-height=\"371\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-1761836416667238.jpg?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-1761836416667238.jpg?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-1761836416667238.jpg?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-1761836416667238.jpg?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-1761836416667238.jpg?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-1761836416667238.jpg?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-1761836416667238.jpg?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/1017993-1761836416667238.jpg?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Carvana Coverage Map <span>(Q3 Shareholder Letter)</span></p></figcaption></figure><div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While the valuation here certainly is high compared to peers, you aren't going to get this kind of growth elsewhere in the space. With Carvana's worst days behind it, I think this pullback provides an opportunity for those looking to \"buy,\" and thus that will be my new rating here today. I was definitely one of the company's biggest skeptics a few years ago, but the major turnaround here now has me believing that there are still gains to be had for shareholders moving forward.</p>",

While this could suggest that my call was a bit too early<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> considering the cautious stance of the market, its valuation was justified then. And now, SHAK is becoming more attractive with its robust </span><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/4511190-shake-shack-non-gaap-eps-of-0_36-beats-by-0_05-revenue-of-367_4m-beats-by-3_69m\" class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 2025 performance</a><span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> and well-positioned fundamentals. Market challenges are still there, but resilience is present. Technicals are still weak, but bullish divergences are appearing once again.</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">SHAK Q3 2025: Its Strength Sustained</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The macroeconomic environment remains challenging for many restaurants. Discretionary spending is still experiencing softness as inflation affects purchasing power. Yet, those who capitalize on value propositions and prudent and cautious expansion are taking advantage of the situation. Increasing brand popularity also bolsters their demand. Shake Shack, Inc. also enjoys this trend as reflected by its Q3 2025 performance.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its operating revenue amounted to <a href=\"https://investor.shakeshack.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Shake-Shack-Announces-Third-Quarter-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">$367.4M</a>, up by 16% YoY from $316.9M. Its company-operated and franchised stores were stronger during the quarter as Shack sales and licensing revenue rose. As you can see, systemwide sales reached $571.5M, a 15% YoY increase from Q3 2024. At first glance, one might think that this was only due to SHAK’s continued expansion. After all, it opened a total of 13 new company-operated and seven licensed Shacks during the quarter. But if we look closely, SHAK really had a stronger performance. Note that it already has <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001620533/10d84de8-2a9a-466b-b8fe-0793d8665ade.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">630</a> restaurants today versus <a href=\"https://s27.q4cdn.com/357966323/files/doc_financials/2024/q3/b478f899-4d0e-4bd7-8a63-46ef58ad5570.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">552</a> restaurants on a YoY basis. With that, Shacks generated average sales of $907,143 versus $896,919. This is also higher than in my previous coverage.</p> <div class=\"table-responsive paywall-full-content\"> <span class=\"sa-table-scroll-wrapper sa-hide-scrollbar\"><span data-intersection-boundary=\"start\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-start\"></span><table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>Q3 2024</td> <td>Q2 2025</td> <td>Q3 2025</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Systemwide Sales</td> <td>$495.1M</td> <td>$549.9M</td> <td>$571.5M</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Restaurant Count</td> <td>552</td> <td>610</td> <td>630</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Average Sales Per Restaurant</td> <td>$896,919</td> <td>$901,475</td> <td>$907,143</td> </tr> </table> <span data-intersection-boundary=\"end\" data-test-id=\"table-scroll-wrapper-boundary-end\"></span></span><button type=\"button\" class=\"sa-table-enlarge-button\">Click to enlarge</button> </div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, SHAK did not become too complacent with its expansion. In fact, it appears more efficient today than in the previous year despite higher cost pressures. Its total operating expenses only increased by 4%, so revenue growth is more than enough to offset it. As a result, its operating margin improved from -5.6% to 5.0% YoY.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1516\" data-height=\"681\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Income Statement\" width=\"640\" height=\"287\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"287\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191436593334_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Income Statement <span>(SHAK Q3 2025 Release)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">It Remains Well Positioned</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Inflation is still a challenge for many restaurants. I know that this impacts fast-food restaurants much more than fine-dining and fast-casual restaurants like SHAK. Yet, there may be a point where inflation reaches a point where consumers might rethink their spending habits. Although it capitalizes on value propositions rather than pricing strategies, SHAK may still be affected. Note that inflation has already regained momentum to its 14-month high of <a href=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/inflation-cpi\" rel=\"nofollow\">3.0%</a>. Nonetheless, SHAK has natural insulation, making it well-positioned against headwinds and for possible market opportunities.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">1. Premium Pricing Gives It Some Flexibility</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Because of value propositions and target market, fast-casual restaurants like SHAK set premium prices on burgers, unlike quick-service restaurants, such as McDonald's Corporation (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MCD\" title=\"McDonald's Corporation\">MCD</a>) and Burger King (\"BK\"). It can set higher prices as it boasts product quality and extra convenience for customers. With that, sales and margins are still increasing. Costs and expenses remain well-managed. If inflation skyrockets and impacts demand, I believe that SHAK can afford to lower prices to still attract and stabilize demand without sacrificing margins. It may even narrow its gap from the QSRs I mentioned, which may highlight product differentiation. As a result, it can take away a portion of their demand.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">2. Prudent And Cautious Expansion Protects Its Topline Growth</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite its increasing popularity in recent years, SHAK prevents itself from overexpanding. It still has less than 1,000 stores globally, although its store openings continue to increase. This prevents unnecessary expenses and cash burns considering macroeconomic volatility.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition, most Shacks are located in prime locations like central business districts, national airports, luxury malls, and near large hotels. That way, it is likely that the people in the vicinity can afford to purchase its products. It can also avoid direct competition with cheaper options. This is a very crucial consideration in emerging and third-world economies because of the tendency to value prices more than value propositions. And the way I see it, SHAK is successful in it. A perfect example is in my country, the Philippines. You can only see Shacks in <a href=\"https://shakeshack.ph/locations\" rel=\"nofollow\">prime locations</a>, especially malls that are frequented by people from middle-income to upper-middle-income households.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">On top of these facts, SHAK is increasing its exposure to franchised or licensed shacks. In fact, it now has 271 licensed Shacks versus 242 YoY. In addition, its licensing revenue per restaurant in Q3 2025 averaged at $53,700 versus $49,700 YoY. This proves that increasing licensed restaurants is fruitful for SHAK. It also helps increase its brand popularity with less capital intensity and expenses. So, it can manage its capex, borrowings, and operating costs and expenses better.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">3. Shifting Consumer Preferences Move In Favor Of Shake Shack</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Another factor is the increased health consciousness of consumers. While these are typically behavioral, I believe that the pandemic stimulated this trend. People going for healthier options open new opportunities. We know that <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness/nutrition/article-741664\" rel=\"nofollow\">burgers are often considered junk foods</a>. But the narrative may be different for Shake Shack Hamburger. It's a classic hamburger that only has 370 calories and 24 grams of carbohydrates. What makes it more interesting is its whopping <a href=\"https://lorieeberwellnesscoaching.com/healthiest-fast-food-burger/\" rel=\"nofollow\">25 grams of protein</a>, an important component for building muscles.</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">4. Robust Fundamentals Are A Testament To Its Solid Business Model And Strategies</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Its capex is over $100M, which is not surprising since it has a higher concentration on company-operated Shacks. Despite this, its operating cash flow remains high enough to cover capex. In fact, it generated an FCF of $152.5M, which means that it converted 15% of its sales into free cash using the FCF/Sales Ratio. This amount is also enough to cover all remaining outflows, such as debt repayments and stock repurchases. With that, SHAK has a very high liquidity as its cash level keeps increasing.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"729\" data-height=\"745\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Cash Flow\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"654\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-176191462898063_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Cash Flow <span>(SHAK Q3 2025 Release)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">It is also worth noting that it has a relatively low and stable debt level with a long maturity profile. In fact, no amount will mature within a year. Cash alone can cover the whole amount in a single payment even if SHAK doesn’t have to. Indeed, it has a large buffer to sustain its expanding operating capacity. It maintains enough income and cash reserves to expand even without increasing its borrowings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"777\" data-height=\"772\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Balance Sheet\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"636\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619146859756806_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Balance Sheet <span>(SHAK Q3 2025 Release)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The continued price decrease in SHAK makes it even more attractive today. This justifies my Hold rating at $130. And even if I was a bit early to rate it a buy at $99, the dip opens more buying opportunities. This is proven by my updated valuation. As you can see, the price remains cheap relative to previous years. Using P/S, the price only trades at 2.73x versus the five-year average of 3.45x. If I use this to derive the fair value, the target price or TP will be $115.57. The same applies to cash per share as it only trades at 10.23x versus the average of 12.29x. This gives a TP of $109.72. And even if I add a 10% risk consideration, SHAK will still appear quite underpriced due to the new TPs of $104.02 and $98.76.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">While price ratios are historical, they can point to the potential direction of the stock price. Note that the regression model in my previous coverage revealed a high correlation between cash per share and the EPS. It also showed that their direct relationship did not happen by chance. So, valuation makes sense today.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619148701067393.png?io=w640\" alt=\"P/S And P/CPS Ratio\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\"> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">P/S And P/CPS Ratio <span>(Author's Computation)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Technicals</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">SHAK’s technicals still show bearish tendencies as the price decreases with lower highs and lows. It is also below the 50-day and 200-day SMA, so the downtrend still holds. The 50-day SMA is also still trending downwards below the 200-day SMA, so market sentiment is still quite pessimistic. On the other hand, we can note that the price and 50-day SMA downtrends have flattened a bit recently. This can tell us that buyers have started seeing the current price as an ideal entry point.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"861\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Technical Analysis\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"287\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619149643684638_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Technical Analysis <span>(Yahoo Finance)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Meanwhile, MACD and RSI show early bullish divergences. As you can see, the MACD line has increased as the price kept decreasing. This can imply that the stock has become attractive for many buyers. Although it is still within negative territory, it has already crossed above the signal line close to zero, showing that buying volume has increased recently. It is also worth noting that the histogram is moving within positive territory, so buying volume has already outpaced selling volume. RSI may explain this because the stock became oversold, prompting new entries at $91-95. Now, the trend has already normalized, which can lead to consolidation. But since it’s quite close to the oversold region, there is still wide room for buying and may drive some upside.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1844\" data-height=\"838\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Technical Analysis\" contenteditable=\"false\" width=\"640\" height=\"291\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/31/61361597-17619150763464527_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Technical Analysis <span>(TradingView)</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Shake Shack, Inc. remains a strong and well-positioned company, supported by its prudent and cautious expansion and pricing strategies.

Technicals are still bearish, but recent overselling and early bullish tendencies open new buying opportunities. I’m reiterating my Buy rating on SHAK stock.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CPAC\" title=\"Cementos Pacasmayo S.A.A.\">CPAC</a></span>) reported <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834966-cementos-pacasmayo-s-a-a-cpac-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">3Q25 results</a> this week.</p> <p>The company continues to show volume strength thanks to the combination of infrastructure projects (carrying cement and concrete demand) and a better agricultural economy in the North<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> of Peru. Margins have decreased because of bonus expenses related to union negotiations, but they should improve at these volumes next year.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall, since I last wrote about Pacasmayo with a Buy rating in late <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805464-cementos-pacasmayo-is-seeing-cyclical-growth-and-its-dividend-yield-might-reach-13-percent\">July 2025</a>, the company's share price is up 16%. I believe the name remains attractive given that I believe it can maintain a cash profitability of about $70 million, plus growth of LSD/MSD, compared to a market cap of $600 million.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Good volumes and pricing</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">After a few years of moderate volumes in self-construction, the most important driver of sales in Pacasmayo's market, the segment is starting to pick up.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Infrastructure has been the driver for more than a year and continues to be so. The company reported on its release that the construction sector is growing at almost 5% YoY in Peru as a whole, driven by infrastructure (mainly PPP projects). In the case of Pacasmayo, we have three important projects: the Motupe riverbanks, the Yanacocha mine, and the Tarata bridge. In previous calls (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4730607-cementos-pacasmayo-s-a-a-cpac-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript\">3Q24</a>, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4779714-cementos-pacasmayo-s-a-a-cpac-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">1Q25</a>), the company had said these projects would provide a tailwind into FY25 and 1H26.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The question is what would happen afterward, and this quarter shed some positive light on that. According to the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4834966-cementos-pacasmayo-s-a-a-cpac-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">recent call</a>, agricultural activity is following a positive climatic cycle in Northern Peru (specialty crops like avocados, blueberries, etc.). This industry employs almost 1/3 of all people in the region, meaning better crops move employment and incomes, leading these workers, mostly rural employees, to save more in the form of bags of cement to slowly build and improve their houses.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The impact is clear: Q1 volumes were <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4789770-cementos-pacasmayos-region-shows-growth-but-the-name-is-still-a-hold\">slightly up</a>, Q2 volumes were <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805464-cementos-pacasmayo-is-seeing-cyclical-growth-and-its-dividend-yield-might-reach-13-percent\">up 7%</a>, and Q3 volumes were up 9%. Infrastructure continues to be the main driver, with concrete up 30% for the quarter and the year but only representing 50% of the increase in cement sales (concrete carries 0% to negative LSD gross margins, meaning all profits are profits from cement sales).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revenues grew 11%, implying there have been some pricing improvements as well, although this has not been addressed in the report or the call.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Margins this year and the next</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Plant utilization in the aggregate was up 5 pp versus last year in the same quarter and 4 pp for the year. Overall, a positive driver for gross margins, up 130bps in the quarter.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">However, EBITDA margins were down 2 pp for the quarter. The driver was, as mentioned in previous quarters, an increase in Opex of 30%, which, in monetary terms, ate 85% of the improvement of gross profitability for the quarter. The driver has been responsible for the payment or accrual recording of bonuses provided every few years to workers, as the union bargaining agreement is signed.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This points towards much better margins if the union agreement expenses are not recorded next year. If the increase in personnel expenses for the year is fully explained by the union bonus (not clarified), then that is a 2pp lift on EBITDA next year and almost a 10% increase in operating profits.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Looking ahead</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company will probably close the year posting similar growth figures to the rest of the year in the HSD region. At least in 1H26, I think we should not see many changes in this panorama. The question after that is whether there are any new projects announced, of which there has been no mention.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Without projects, concrete, and therefore cement sales could decrease. With lower volumes, utilization falls, and also margins, even if next year will have lower operating expenses, ideally.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">So far, it is too soon to tell. I prefer not to bank on HSD growth ahead, but I'm not thinking yet of decreasing revenues, especially if the agricultural economy of the north remains ok.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company spent some time in the call and the release commenting on the recent ousting of Peru's President by the Congress. The country will elect a new President in March 2026, but so far, it should not affect the business climate, given that, unfortunately, the country is used to political turmoil in the Presidency. In the past two presidential mandates (2016-2021 and 2021-2025), the country has turned over six presidents, as the President is ousted, then the Vice President (this is what happened this year), and then the President of Congress takes office.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Valuation figures remain attractive to fair</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Until we have more info on potential projects, I continue to believe the company's growth next year should stabilize around MSD. Whether or not it goes lower or higher will depend on infrastructure, but the tailwind from the first half should still be strong enough, barring problems in the local economy.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In my <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4805464-cementos-pacasmayo-is-seeing-cyclical-growth-and-its-dividend-yield-might-reach-13-percent\">previous article</a>, I calculated that the company could generate about PEN 245 million in distributable cash at these margins and utilization, based on projections for revenues, margins, and cash utilization on working capital and CAPEX.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Recently, the company announced a <a href=\"https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=103074&amp;ref=319520382&amp;type=PDF&amp;symbol=CPAC&amp;cdn=3b822909af50603603da568daf0760a6&amp;companyName=Cementos+Pacasmayo+S.A.A.+American+Depositary+Shares+%28Each+representing+five%29&amp;formType=6-K&amp;formDescription=Report+of+foreign+private+issuer+pursuant+to+Rule+13a-16+or+15d-16+under+the+Securities+Exchange+Act+of+1934&amp;dateFiled=2025-10-22\" rel=\"nofollow\">dividend</a> for the year of PEN 190 million (PEN 175 million net of treasury shares), or $56 million, a 9.3% yield on the current market cap.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">This is not so far from my calculations, and management considered on the call that it is keeping a little more cash and maintaining a dividend level below full capabilities because it wants to continue deleveraging, which I believe is healthy, even if rates are not so high.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Overall though, I believe the company's cash generation capacity remains at about PEN 245 million, or $70 million, which represents an interesting 11.6% yield on the market cap. To this, we need to add the potential for growth between LSD and MSD over the cycle.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In terms of cyclical position, I would believe we are now closer to a local top than to the average, given that both infrastructure and the local economy are doing well. Whether or not this will continue in 2H26 is uncertain.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the time being, I find the price is still attractive while looking at these developments in terms of growth and margins, with interest for future quarters. I maintain a Buy so far.</p>",

This result takes the bank's year-to-date EPS to $3.24, up 24% year-on-year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Net interest income ('NII') accounts for around 75% of BOH's revenue, so trends here are critical to its financial performance. In turn, NII is a function of the level of interest-earning assets and the margin earned on those assets.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BOH generated $136.675 million in NII last quarter, up 16% year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter. This growth is mainly being driven by the ongoing recovery in its net interest margin ('NIM'). The reason for this is that BOH has one of the most rigid balance sheets among the U.S. banks I cover. Not only do fixed-rate residential mortgages account for over 30% of its loan book (around 20% of its earning assets), but it is also holding around $7.5 billion in long-dated investment securities. Since these were largely bought when interest rates were very low, the yield on this part of its balance sheet remains very low.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><picture> <span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618722186872654_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1202\" data-height=\"898\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618722186872654_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bank of Hawaii Q3 2025 NIM Bridge\" width=\"640\" height=\"478\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"478\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618722186872654_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618722186872654_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618722186872654_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618722186872654_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618722186872654_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618722186872654_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618722186872654_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618722186872654_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span> </picture><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Bank of Hawaii Q3 2025 Results Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">BOH's NIM clocked in at 2.46% last quarter, up 7 bps quarter-on-quarter and 28 bps year-on-year. Its recent expansion hasn't really been driven by cheaper funding. Indeed, BOH's cost of deposits fell just 1 bp sequentially last quarter to 1.59%. Just to be clear, this is a very strong print. However, because its funding costs are already quite low, it simply doesn't have as much scope to reduce this compared to other banks.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In contrast, BOH has plenty of scope to increase its interest-earning asset yield. This rose 7 bps sequentially last quarter, but it remains quite low at just 4.08%. Looking at the drivers of that, the blended yield of BOH's investment securities expanded by 9 bps quarter-on-quarter to 2.59%. Per the image below, the company disclosed that maturities were running off at a yield of around 2.4%, while new purchases had a blended rate of around 5.3%. Given how low the current yield is, lower interest rates won't really threaten this trend unless they collapse. In other words, repricing in this part of its book is going to be a multi-year tailwind for BOH, supporting its overall earning-asset yield.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">There is a similar dynamic at play in the loan book, where front book yields are higher than the back book. This drove BOH's blended loan yield up 6 bps sequentially last quarter to 4.86%.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-1761867440419185_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1386\" data-height=\"628\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-1761867440419185_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bank of Hawaii Q3 2025 Fixed-Asset Repricing Overview\" width=\"640\" height=\"290\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"290\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-1761867440419185_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-1761867440419185_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-1761867440419185_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-1761867440419185_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-1761867440419185_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-1761867440419185_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-1761867440419185_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-1761867440419185_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Source: Bank of Hawaii Q3 2025 Results Presentation</span></p></figcaption></figure><p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now, while lower funding costs have only contributed modestly to BOH's recent NIM expansion, the bank does still have some benefit to come through here. Indeed, management disclosed a 1.54% cost of deposits at the end of last quarter, 5 bps below its period-average rate. Looking ahead, BOH will see some benefit from the ongoing repricing of term deposits. It disclosed a 3.4% average cost here last quarter, while new offerings were being priced at 2.5-3%, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833767-bank-of-hawaii-corporation-boh-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833767-bank-of-hawaii-corporation-boh-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">according</a> to management.

BOH doesn't need to go out and hire more employees or open new branches just because its NIM expands, so this incremental NII mostly drops down to pre-tax income. Indeed, BOH's non-interest expenses were $112.387 million last quarter, up just under 5% year-on-year. The fact that this trailed revenue growth by around 1,100 bps is largely what drove its strong EPS growth. This trend should continue alongside NIM expansion, which is why analysts continue to forecast strong earnings growth in the coming years.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618376070086663_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1318\" data-height=\"780\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618376070086663_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bank of Hawaii Quarterly EPS Estimates (Q4 2025 - Q4 2027) As Of October 2025\" width=\"640\" height=\"379\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"379\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618376070086663_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618376070086663_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618376070086663_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618376070086663_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618376070086663_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618376070086663_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618376070086663_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618376070086663_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\">Bank of Hawaii Quarterly EPS Estimates <span>(Source: Seeking Alpha )</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Revisiting Its Conservative Credentials</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In addition to the tailwind coming from NIM expansion, BOH's relatively low-risk business model was also part of my investment case for the bank. Tariff-related fears from earlier in the year may not have come to pass, but there is still a significant amount of economic uncertainty out there, so it is worth revisiting this part of the thesis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Positively, BOH's credit quality continues to look very resilient. The bank reported $2.6 million in net charge-offs last quarter, equal to an annualized ratio of just 0.07% of its total loans. Early-stage delinquencies also remain muted. BOH had just $24 million in loans past due 30-59 days at the end of last quarter, down around $6 million from the start of the year.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As you can see below, BOH has a long track record of suffering below-average credit losses. One reason for this is that its loan book is largely secured by real estate. This backs over 85% of its consumer portfolio and around 75% of its commercial book. Across these two categories, its weighted average loan-to-value ratio is just 51%, affording it a large cushion before defaults would turn into actual losses.</p> <figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618686934599402_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1282\" data-height=\"532\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618686934599402_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\"Bank of Hawaii net charge-off ratio versus the average for bank holding companies with over $10 billion in total assets\" width=\"640\" height=\"266\" contenteditable=\"false\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"266\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618686934599402_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618686934599402_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618686934599402_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618686934599402_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618686934599402_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618686934599402_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618686934599402_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/33446475-17618686934599402_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span>Data Source: Bank of Hawaii; Federal Reserve</span></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Valuation</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite BOH's earnings growth and conservative profile, the stock has been a disappointing performer over the past year, with its share price down around 10% in that time.

Indeed, given $1.20 in Q3 EPS and a $0.70 per share quarterly dividend, BOH is now back to generating a healthy level of surplus capital. This is only going to improve as its net income continues to grow in the quarters ahead. Given this, management hinted at future buybacks on the <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833767-bank-of-hawaii-corporation-boh-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" title=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4833767-bank-of-hawaii-corporation-boh-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\" target=\"_blank\">earnings call</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"paywall-full-content\"> <p> </p> <p>But I think given where the stock is at right now, we think that there's a great opportunity to deploy capital into repurchases at this point. We probably are likely to be doing some of that activity here in this quarter and into next year. Obviously, the dividend is important to us, but we think the payout ratio for now is in pretty good shape.</p> <p>Peter Ho, Chairman &amp; CEO, Bank of Hawaii</p> </blockquote> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That basically sums up why I remain bullish, notwithstanding the stock's poor recent performance. Earnings are growing, the valuation has contracted and, with buybacks back on the table, the shareholder yield should improve as well. Accordingly, I am leaving my Buy rating for BOH in place.</p>",

(<span class=\"ticker-hover-wrapper\"><a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ROKU\" title=\"Roku, Inc.\">ROKU</a></span>) announced its <a href=\"https://image.roku.com/bWFya2V0aW5n/3Q25-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">third quarter results</a> yesterday after market close, and the response has not been particularly positive, with the stock falling from $100 to $94 in post-market trading as of this writing. I wanted<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> to take a look in at the stock as I actually thought the report was a solid one. Why, then, the decline?</span></p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Solid Earnings Report</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Roku’s post-market fall might lead some to think that the earnings report was a disappointment, but I really don’t see it. The earnings report itself was fine. Roku reported another quarter of positive net income and, unlike last quarter, this time its operating income was positive as well. For the first time since 2021 in fact. Despite the Devices segment falling back into negative gross profit territory—it had pushed itself to break even in Q2—Platform profit growth was enough to <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/roku-sees-operating-income-1236414434/\" rel=\"nofollow\">take operating income to $9.5 million</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Obviously, for a company with a $15 billion market cap that still isn’t very high. But it could be a leading indicator of Roku crossing a tipping point. I believe the drivers of this improved performance are management’s decision to finally pivot to a more subscription-based business model. Since I’ve been arguing for a while that Roku’s advertising focus—which I know many have considered a positive—<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4528260-can-roku-stock-recover-to-100\">was actually a detriment to the company</a>, I’m excited by this new turn. And since subscription, unlike advertising, is still in its very early innings, I’m actually impressed by that small $9.5 million number.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">My Continuing Skepticism About Advertising</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">To be clear, I have never argued that Roku cannot generate substantial <em>revenues</em> from free ad-supported streaming television. Roku Channel continues to move up the ladder in <a href=\"https://www.nielsen.com/data-center/the-gauge/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nielsen’s monthly “The Gauge” report of TV timeshare</a>. In fact, Roku is now the leading streaming channel outside of the Big Four—that's YouTube, Amazon.com, Inc.’s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN\" title=\"Amazon.com, Inc.\">AMZN</a>) Prime Video, Netflix, Inc. (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NFLX\" title=\"Netflix, Inc.\">NFLX</a>) and The Walt Disney Company's (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DIS\" title=\"The Walt Disney Company\">DIS</a>) three separate—for now—services.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">My concern has always been with how much <em>profit</em> that revenue will yield. I have written about this at length before, so only briefly: Roku’s <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4577817-what-no-one-is-seeing-about-advertising-push-netflix-and-roku\">lack of broad first-party data on its customers</a> means that it cannot target advertisements at specific demos with the precision that Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) or a Google (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOGL\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOGL</a>) (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GOOG\" title=\"Alphabet Inc.\">GOOG</a>) could. I believe this means that Roku’s ad-supported service could only ever hope to run at break-even no matter how large it got. You can read more about how I <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4479222-roku-some-very-good-news-should-buy-stock\">analyzed the ad operation to arrive at these conclusions</a> here.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Setting One Thing Straight Before We Dive In</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The pushback to my “subs not ads” thesis from bulls has always been that Roku does have a lot of data to use, and certainly that has been management’s position. CEO Anthony Wood insisted yet again on <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4835953-roku-inc-roku-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript\">today’s earnings conference call</a> that “we have a lot of data” and also argued that “half of all TV streaming happens on our platform.” The implication is that someone who controls half of TV streaming <em>must</em> have some leverage they can use.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I just want to set the record straight on this one more time; Roku does have 50% household penetration, but it does <em>not</em> have 50% of the TV streaming time. This is because many households have devices from multiple manufacturers in their house; my parents have a Roku, an Amazon Fire TV and an Apple Inc.'s (<a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AAPL\" title=\"Apple Inc.\">AAPL</a>) Apple Inc. in various rooms of their home. Wood himself later went back and expressed the number this correctly, “we’re in half the broadband households in the country,” which is accurate. But they do not control half of the streaming time.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">A slightly more reliable indicator is <a href=\"https://www.tvtechnology.com/news/roku-keeps-37-percent-share-of-north-american-ctv-streaming-device-market\" rel=\"nofollow\">the recent survey done by Pixalate</a>, which shows that Roku controls 37% of the open programmatic ads sold on Connected TV devices. That’s a more reasonable estimate that closely aligns with my own research suggesting Roku has about 1/3 of the market. It’s also remarkably steady; a 2017 survey showed <a href=\"https://www.parksassociates.com/blogs/in-the-news/roku-and-amazon-fire-tv-continue-to-gain-market-share--chromecast-and-apple-tv-fall-behind?page=364\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roku with the exact same market share eight years ago</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The Pixalate shows Amazon Fire TV in third at 15%, which is not consistent with my estimates that Amazon controls nearly as large a market share as Roku. However, even Pixalate’s survey is not a complete picture; again, these are “open programmatic” sales, not total sales. Because Roku does not have reliable targeting data from first-party sales and search like Amazon and Google have, it sells more through this channel; Amazon’s market share is correspondingly underrepresented in a poll like this because they do have precise targeting data.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Long-Awaited Advertising Strategy Shift</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That’s probably why after several years of running in the red with their FAST service Roku Channel, Roku has finally decided to bow to the inevitable; the company announced in June that <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/amazon-roku-pool-connected-tv-audiences-advertising-deal-1236432579/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roku would pool their addressable ad pods inside Amazon’s</a> Demand-Side Platform. I consider this auspicious for Roku as it allows better monetization of their ad-supported viewing. Wood confirmed on the call that Amazon’s DSP integration “just” opened, which to me suggests that it probably wasn’t running until sometime in October. If what we are seeing in these numbers is all pre-Amazon, then the early return to operating income, even narrowly, is all the more impressive.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">But if Amazon hasn’t kicked in yet, how did they do it? Management was effusive about the great work of the teams but typically vague about exactly where they’re getting the best results, which for competitive reasons I guess makes sense. But going by their actions, rather than their words, I think it's because they have finally shifted their focus to subscription, ad-free viewing, and by third quarter that transition already was underway.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Finally Embracing Subscriptions</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Roku announced when it released its first-quarter earnings six months ago that it had <a href=\"https://newsroom.roku.com/news/2025/05/roku-to-acquire-streaming-service-provider-frndly-tv/3bhj9ejl-1746105024\" rel=\"nofollow\">entered into a firm agreement to buy the relatively economical skinny bundle TV service Frndly TV</a>. The bundle offers live programming of a number of secondary channels that are neither sports, news nor broadcast. It is one of the few live services out there with plans below $10 per month.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Some have pointed to Frndly’s “live” status and said that this acquisition furthers Roku’s advertising ambitions. With respect, I don’t see it that way at all. Yes, Frndly offers live streams with ads. But hardly anyone watches that way, because Frndly has nothing that needs to be watched live and even most broadcast networks now see most of their scripted and reality content consumed on an on-demand basis.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Frndly’s real appeal to Roku almost certainly is the tech and features they have developed for subscription-based, ad-free viewing; an area in which Roku has little experience since it has, unwisely in my view, spent the past few years developing ad-supported tech stacks and techniques at the expense of any ad-free offering they might have been able to develop.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Even CBS, a channel with much more “heft” than Roku or Frndly, has confirmed that as much as <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4046506-cbs-cbs-q4-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript\">85% of the content that its streaming customers consume is on-demand</a>, not live. For a non-sports/news service like Frndly you have to figure that number is a good deal higher still. 90%, at least. Perhaps 95%? <strong><em>99?!?</em></strong></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">And far from bemoaning that fact, Frndly management, who remain with the company post-closing, have positively leaned into it. Frndly offers Look Back, a 72-hour window to rewatch anything that has been broadcast on any of its channels, and a significant portion of its total content budget is allocated to services such as the Dove Channel, which offers all of its content ad-free on demand to subscribers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Make no mistake, Frndly is an SVOD service, not an AVOD service. In fact, if not in name. And I think that is precisely why Roku wanted it. It is certainly why I wasn’t unhappy to hear they were acquiring it.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Howdy To You, Too</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Roku followed up <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/05/roku-launches-howdy-a-2-99-ad-free-streaming-service/\" rel=\"nofollow\">with the launch of Howdy in August</a>. The name notwithstanding, it’s another exciting development as far as I’m concerned. Howdy is a true SVOD service, a la Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) without even Frndly’s largely superfluous live channel offerings.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The reason I consider this a further step is because of Roku’s data. As I said, contrary to management’s protestations, it’s almost certainly not detailed enough to target advertisements effectively. But the one category of data that Roku <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4152051-roku-intriguing-but-dont-buy-until-it-plugs-these-holes\">does have in considerable quantities is viewership data</a>. Roku knows what its customers search for in its Voice Remotes, what they watch on Roku Channel, and, depending on where they find it, sometimes even what they’re watching on other apps.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The best use for this data is targeting <em>content</em>, not targeting advertisements. But with Roku Channel, they couldn’t turn a profit on content, and with Frndly they can’t decide what content they get—Lifetime and others program their own channels, Frndly/Roku merely act as broadcaster and salesman.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">With Howdy, Roku will <span>finally</span><span> </span>pair ad-free subscriptions with their own content curation efforts. While they’re a long way from being the next Netflix, content curation has considerable potential to yield an enduring profit margin for a subscription video service even without top-tier ad-targeting capabilities, because <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4528281-can-netflix-stock-recover-after-subscriber-loss\">content recommendations can become a self-sustaining internal virtuous cycle</a> in a way that advertising, an intrinsically three-party process, cannot. I wrote before about how the real profit of SVOD, unlike AVOD, lies not in quantity, but in <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724075-netflix-stock-new-strategy-fundamentally-changes-dynamics\">intensity and fungibility of viewership</a>.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Crucial to that is a recommendation engine that becomes embedded in consumers' behavioral expectations. Roku needs to prove to viewers that when they want “something” to watch, as opposed to a specific something, Howdy can find them a suitable piece of content with a minimum amount of wasted browsing time. On the earnings call Roku management also indicated that, while it's still early, they’ve seen good results with their decision to upgrade the recommendations engine to the top row of their eponymous home screen. That too is the right move, and I expect it will continue to bear fruit.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">A Very Preliminary Estimate</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Precisely because it’s so early, putting numbers on exactly how much profit Roku can generate from this is a little harder. Howdy is a $3 per month service, at least to start, and it won’t be profitable until it achieves critical mass. However, with the Q3 report out we do now see the first full quarter of Frndly TV’s operations.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Despite their press release and earnings call today, Roku has not yet filed their official Q3 10-Q at the time of writing, so I don’t have all the data I would like. For now, I am going to use an imputation model based on the assumption that Howdy will be programmed to produce a similar profit per subscriber to Frndly TV.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q2, <a href=\"https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001428439/dcade249-7112-47a7-8a7f-2700bf8f7668.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">management disclosed that</a> Frndly represented roughly 1.8 percentage points of the growth in the Platform segment the company had seen, or roughly $15 million. That was for almost exactly two months. At Frndly’s price of $11 per month on <a href=\"https://www.frndlytv.com/choose-plan-2-annual\" rel=\"nofollow\">their standard, mid-tier plan</a> that comes to roughly 700,000 subscribers.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I continue to believe, <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757679-roku-even-a-smaller-share-of-a-larger-pie-makes-it-a-solid-buy\">as I’ve calculated in prior articles</a>, that Roku’s subscription business is of sufficient size to justify its current market cap. If 700,000 Frndly subscribers can produce $38 million of increased income per year ($9.5 million times four) then at a 25 P/E that is worth almost $1 billion in additional market cap. Currently, Roku and Amazon are performing similarly in the CTV market, and Amazon has roughly 1/3 of Netflix’s viewership in the US. That would suggest Howdy and Frndly together might be able to get to as many as 25 million subscribers in the US. That would be enough to increase market cap by $35 billion, more than tripling Roku’s current share price!</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">That seems optimistic to me; I suspect these numbers are slanted by the fact that Roku and Amazon both report to the Nielsen Gauge not only their own viewership but also the premium subscriptions—HBO Max, Peacock, etc.—that are routed through their platforms. If we assume they represent half the viewership reported, SVOD will “only” double Roku’s market cap.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Investment Summary</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">For the past few years, I have been following a straightforward approach to Roku: ride the rollercoaster. That’s not always a good thing in stock trading, but when the highs and lows hold firm it can be very lucrative. I have an entry point around $60 and a sell point around $100. Three times in the past two years, Roku has run right up to the edge of the $100 point, and each time it has done so rebounding off of a sub-$60 floor. It's been possible to simply rinse and repeat.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am wondering if this pattern is starting to break down. The release of Roku’s second-quarter earnings sent the stock plunging even though they came in mostly better than expected. It went back below $80. But then it rebounded back to $100.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Now it reports another good earnings, the stock falls again anyway….but only to $94. It’s been quite a while since Roku saw the sub-$60 range. And the developments of recent weeks suggest that perhaps it won’t again anytime soon.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I confess to being torn. I’m considerably more positive on Roku now than I was before they pivoted from advertising to subscription. But my high-low formula has been a consistent performer for the past few years. Should I abandon it and buy in now, or await a future dip?</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I am honestly unsure. When torn between a weak Buy and a strong Hold, I usually opt for the latter to avoid buying something I lack complete conviction in. But the truth is I don’t lack conviction in Roku’s upside; I just question whether it will be even cheaper later than it is now.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">I have not yet bought in, but I may today. I’ll see how it opens, but regardless of whether it returns to its floor again or not, I believe Roku is finally ready to break through its ceiling in the coming months. As such, while I am not completely sure of the timing of my next Roku purchase yet, I am going to give it a Buy rating.</p>",

For our new readers, Lufthansa is one of the largest<span class=\"paywall-full-content\"> airlines, and its network airlines segment includes SWISS, ITA, Austrian, Brussels Airlines, and a low-cost operator called Eurowings. Additionally, Lufthansa offers aviation services such as Cargo, MRO, and catering.</span></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lufthansa’s CMD set ambitious margin ambitions, a leaner fleet plan, and clear priorities across business segments. Management expressed confidence in exceeding pre-COVID margin levels, underpinned by a stronger balance sheet, improving FCF, and rising shareholder payouts. At today’s market value, the MRO franchise alone accounts for a large share of the enterprise value.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 Results</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">In Q3, Lufthansa Group's top-line sales were €11.2 billion, up 11% from the previous year. As the company <a href=\"https://newsroom.lufthansagroup.com/en/lufthansa-group-achieves-operating-profit-of-13-billion-euros-in-the-third-quarter-and-confirms-outlook-for-significant-profit-increase-for-the-full-year/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reported</a>, \"<em>this was the strongest quarter in terms of revenue in the history of the Lufthansa Group</em>.\" EBIT reached €1.3 billion, which was at the previous year's level; however, EBIT margin declined by 60 basis points to 11.9%. Passenger yields were weaker at -5.4% and dragged down by Europe and North America. On a positive note, Lufthansa Cargo continued its positive trajectory with an EBIT of €49 million. Meanwhile, the Lufthansa Technik [MRO] segment reported an EBIT decrease. The division reached an EBIT of €130 million. Going down to the P&amp;L, the company's net profit amounted to €966 million as tax weighed into results.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1856\" data-height=\"788\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\" Lufthansa Q3 results\" width=\"640\" height=\"272\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618140797400863_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span> Lufthansa Q3 results </span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Source: <a href=\"https://investor-relations.lufthansagroup.com/fileadmin/downloads/en/charts-speeches/LH-QR-2025-3-charts-aerjrtn.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lufthansa Q3 results ppt</a> - Fig 1</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Why Are We positive?</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The company's quarterly results look fine, though the first read skews more negative than positive. However, digging into the report, we remain constructive for the following reason:</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">MRO Upside Is Still There, And Supportive Cost-Management</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">The MRO division's core operating profit decreased to €130 million compared to €161 million in Q3 2024. Higher tariffs, a weaker dollar, and additional costs to production ramp-up negatively impacted the segment. That said, top-line sales were up by 10%, and the company reported a solid order book. Looking forward (Fig. 2), Lufthansa won maintenance contracts with EasyJet and Cathay Group.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Within the adjusted EBIT detail, Pax Airlines delivered a flat performance compared to Q3 2024. This result was achieved with ex-fuel unit costs up to 0.5% and should be positively received.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1288\" data-height=\"498\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\" Lufthansa MRO Upside\" width=\"640\" height=\"247\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618143038553374_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span> Lufthansa MRO Upside</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fig 2</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">FCF And Deleverage Path</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 FCF was materially higher than expected, reaching €818 million (Fig. 1). So, net debt (including pension) fell to €7.2 billion compared to a Q3 2024 of €8.3 billion (Fig. 3). Net pension fell to €2.1 billion, with liquidity higher than €900 million to €11.9 billion. Here at the Lab, we believe this is just the beginning, and this high conviction is reinforced by LHA's turnaround plan to save at least €1.5 billion (Fig. 4).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\"><figure class=\"regular-img-figure paywall-full-content\" contenteditable=\"false\"><span><a href=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618146847916088_origin.png\" rel=\"lightbox\" data-width=\"1840\" data-height=\"792\" data-og-image-twitter_small_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_large_card=\"true\" data-og-image-twitter_image_post=\"true\" data-og-image-msn=\"true\" data-og-image-facebook=\"true\" data-og-image-google_news=\"true\" data-og-image-google_plus=\"true\" data-og-image-linkedin=\"true\" role=\"button\" aria-label=\"Expand image into lightbox view\"><img src=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618146847916088_origin.png?io=w640\" alt=\" Lufthansa net debt evolution\" width=\"640\" height=\"275\" contenteditable=\"false\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618146847916088_origin.png?io=w1536 1536w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618146847916088_origin.png?io=w1280 1280w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618146847916088_origin.png?io=w1080 1080w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618146847916088_origin.png?io=w750 750w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618146847916088_origin.png?io=w640 640w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618146847916088_origin.png?io=w480 480w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618146847916088_origin.png?io=w320 320w, https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2025/10/30/51181085-17618146847916088_origin.png?io=w240 240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 36px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 180px), 552px\"></a></span><figcaption><p class=\"item-caption\"><span> Lufthansa net debt evolution</span></p></figcaption></figure></p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Fig 3</p> <h4 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Pick-up In Airline Search Trends</h4> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Cross-checking Google search, new evidence suggests that airline searches have become more popular.

The company confirmed its yearly guidance and reported a higher EBIT than in 2024 (which reached €1.64 billion). Considering this print, Lufthansa's core operating profit amounted to €1.5 billion year-to-date, up by €300 million compared to last year's level. Q4 is a strong quarter for Pax Airlines and Cargo, while it is softer on MRO. Recent booking trends also suggest higher volumes. Our valuation is backed by a sum-of-the-parts thesis, which includes the airlines and MRO segment. On a YTD results, the airlines generated an EBIT of €1.2 billion, and are targeting a 1.6-1.7 billion result by year-end. While the MRO division has an €800 million core operating profit performance. Considering the Cargo business, we believe a €3 billion core operating profit is still achievable.</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">As reported in our Q3 results paragraph, there was a higher tax rate in the third quarter; however, we applied the corporate tax rate of 25%. So, our income projections are set at €2.1 billion, which derives an EPS of €1.75. With no change to our valuation methodology (6x P/E target), Lufthansa's price is confirmed at €10.5 per share ($12.15 in ADR).</p> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Lufthansa's current market cap is €8.6 billion. As a reminder, a group of private equity firms <a href=\"https://pe-insights.com/bains-negotiation-stalled-as-lufthansa-cancels-8-7bn-technik-sale/\" rel=\"nofollow\">tried</a> to acquire the MRO division, valuing the subsidiary at approximately $8.7 billion (€7.5 billion). Considering the evolution of FCF, the company will likely exceed its FCF target of €800 million with a potential further debt repayment. We are not underwriting 2026 yet (with supportive evidence from the CMD update). Still, aside from ongoing cost optimization, there is also a higher capacity in 2026, with the company expecting an increase of 4%.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Risks</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Our downside risks include the company's ongoing restructuring initiatives, estimated at €1.5 billion, and higher competition from low-cost operators. Lufthansa's risks are also lower due to lower travel demand from business and leisure, changes in oil prices, wage inflation, higher regulatory standards and airport costs, FX changes, and all the negative event risks related to travel, such as airport shutdowns, cybersecurity risks, natural catastrophes, and terrorist actions/attacks.</p> <h2 class=\"paywall-full-content\">Conclusion</h2> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Q3 results de-risk Lufthansa's investment thesis, and there is upside valuation to consider. Following the CMD release, the company has a clear earnings/transforming roadmap for delivery. Therefore, our buy rating is confirmed.</p> <div class=\"before_last_paragraph-piano-placeholder paywall-full-content\"></div> <p class=\"paywall-full-content\">Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
